You've done it again, Kona-chan.
That was amazing.
How come you aren't on any sports teams...
...when you're so athletic?
'Cause if I join a team...
...I'll miss my prime time anime.
Speedy
Lady
Say, Tsukasa.
Which end of a chocolate cornet do you start from?
The head, I suppose.
I see.
By the way...
Which side's the head?
The fat end or the thin end?
I would guess the thin end.
Oh.
I thought it was the fat end.
But why would the thin end be the head?
Well, doesn't it look like a seashell?
Why did you think it was the fat end, Kona-chan?
'Cause, you know...
It looks like a caterpillar?
A caterpillar?
But I guess it works better if you picture a seashell.
U-Um...
You could cut off the thin end...
...and eat it with the excess chocolate.
Now I get it.
Good thinking, Miyuki-san.
You're so smart.
Not at all.
Everyone has their own approach to eating.
How do you eat cream puffs?
Cream puffs, you ask?
Well...
I start by splitting it in half...
...and eating the lid after dipping it in the cream from the bottom...
And then I eat the bottom half.
This way, I don't have to worry about any cream spilling out...
...while maintaining a balance between cream and puff.
What about the ones that have both custard and cream inside?
How do you eat those?
Do you mix them up?
No.
I wouldn't do such a thing.
But how would you mix them?
Just asking.
When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake...
...or the chestnut on top of a Mont Blanc?
Let's see...
There are also strawberries tucked between layers of sponge cake.
I follow a normal distribution of strawberry, cream, and cake as I eat.
So there isn't a set time for eating the strawberry.
You really know your stuff.
I always save the strawberry for last.
But then I get full sometimes...
...so I end up not eating it...
...or someone in my family takes it.
Your favorites gotta come first.
Actually, I don't think I've ever seen anyone take a strawberry from Sis.
That's Kagami for you.
Doesn't miss a step.
Are you able to eat the last bite of a popsicle without dropping it?
Dropping it?
If you aren't careful...
...you drop the last bit, right?
What do you do, Kona-chan?
Suck it down to nothing.
You could rotate the popsicle as you eat.
That's a good idea.
I'm not very fond of ice cream cones.
Why?
I can't stand it when only the cone is left.
That's right.
You always end up with some cone left.
I push the ice cream into the cone as I eat.
How do you push the ice cream?
I do a little ~gui gui~ action as I eat.
~gui gui~, is it?
Yuki-chan prioritizes balance, right?
That's right.
Then what do you do with curry rice?
Do you mix the sauce with the rice?
No.
I don't mix them...
...but I make sure that they're equally proportioned.
I mix mine up.
What about you, Kona-chan?
Depends on the curry.
If there's any Worcester sauce or raw egg in it...
...I guess I do a little mixy-wixy.
Worcester sauce in curry?
It's good stuff.
Do you also put Worcester sauce on your fried eggs?
I put soy sauce on fried eggs.
I use mayonnaise.
On your fried eggs?
I don't mean boiled eggs.
You see, mayonnaise...
...goes well with most egg dishes.
Do you put it on your curry?
It's a must on white rice.
But the sweetness also goes well with beef bowls.
It's also good with parent-child bowls.
You know how eggs and chicken meat are child and parent.
So once I add mayonnaise, which is made from eggs...
...I call it an expanded family bowl.
Also...
I usually can't stand natto...
...but I was able to eat it once I added mayonnaise.
Can't imagine it.
But...
...putting mayonnaise on soft-boiled eggs might be best.
The fried eggs at my house are also half-done.
It's how my dad likes them.
He likes to suck out the yolk.
And if it's overcooked, he can't suck the yolk.
What about yakitori?
What about it?
Do you leave it on the spit?
Or do you use chopsticks to take it off?
Let's see...
If I'm eating one by myself, I'll leave it on the spit.
But if I'm with other people, I'll take it off.
Yeah, yeah.
Isn't it a little awkward when there's only one left?
I can't bring myself to take the last one.
As time goes by without anyone eating it...
It starts getting dry...
...and looking anything but appetizing...
...and no one's willing to make a move...
...but when the busboy takes it, you go...
"Wait, we're not done with that yet."
...kinda on reflex.
But then you end up leaving without eating it.
Such a waste.
I feel sorry for it.
And when you grill meat...
...I feel sorry for the meat that's all charred and stuck to the grill.
You have to eat while you're grilling and chatting...
...so it's a busy ordeal.
It's even worse with onion beef tongue slices since they're done in'no time.
You're right.
They're done after just one flip.
Flip?
Onion beef tongue slices?
You can't flip those.
Really?
If you flip them over...
...the onions on top will fall off.
Oh, yeah.
They'll finish cooking without any flipping.
I see...
I'll do that from now on.
You can never flip them.
Really...
By the way, is the head of a chocolate cornet the fat or thin end?
Locked up for two months
"I wanted to make her my slave
Super bad boy.
There've been a bunch of kidnapping cases recently.
Guys forcing girls to address them as "Master" and stuff.
Isn't that less...
...an issue of morals...
...and more an issue of playing too many dating sims and adult games?
It's a commonly used scenario.
Aren't you talking about yourself?!
Er, wait a tick.
Why are you so well versed in the adult game scenarios...
...Miss High School Second-year?
First Semester Midterm Grades
Miyuki Takara
Your grades are always so good.
Don't you have any faults, Miyuki-san?
I'm ashamed to say...
...that I have a tendency to brood over things...
...or space out.
I've cut my finger while using a slicer.
Ow!
And tripped over myself while in a hurry.
And gotten my bag stuck in the door on a train.
Miyuki-san.
Those aren't faults, but elements of moe.
Moe?
The clumsy factor.
What was going on inside Kona-chan's head during all that?!
Miyuki-san, why do you wear glasses when you're actually attractive?
You'll only nab a niche audience.
Nab's a little...
Setting aside the issue of popularity...
...why don't you wear contacts?
I heard that glasses make your vision worse.
Um...
I'm ashamed to be saying this in high school...
B-But...
I'm...
Scared!
Of contacts!
Or to be specific...
...putting things in my eyes.
I can never open my eyes when I'm underwater.
Damn!
She's cute to the core!
Must be innate.
Isn't that Miyuki-san?
YOSHIMIZU
OPTOMETRY
Is she here for an eye examination?
To get contacts?
YOSHIMIZU
OPTOMETRY
Miyuki-san's probably better off this way forever.
That looked painful...
A pillar of evolution.
Kagami's at home with a cold?
It looks like she doesn't have the flu though.
I'm stupid, so I don't have to worry about getting the flu.
I've heard that applies to colds...
...but it also applies to the flu?
There's a difference between a cold and the flu?
I thought the flu was like a super cold.
I-I think they're different...
But now I'm not sure anymore...
The difference between the flu and a cold?
Well...
The flu is caused by a virus.
The symptoms are a fever and aching throughout the body.
And there is a risk of complications.
On the other hand...
...the symptoms of a cold are a sore throat and runny nose...
...and the fever doesn't run as high.
And there are a number of other minute differences.
Which is why...
...they are different illnesses.
I see...
H-However...
Well, they share many similarities...
...so you could possibly say that the flu is an upgraded version of a cold...
I see!
Kona-chan.
What's with the pensive face?
Oh, nothing big.
I was just curious about something after our conversation this morning.
About a cold and the flu?
You didn't disagree when I said I was dumb.
N-No!
It's not like that!
Konata-chan.
Welcome.
She's here to visit Sis.
Thank you for visiting.
It's nothing.
Sorry to intrude.
Kagami actually looks pretty cute when she's asleep.
What is it?!
Why are you here?!
She's up. She's up.
Get out!
Visiting?
You?
For my sake?
That's right.
B-But I don't want you to catch the flu from me.
I appreciate the thought though.
Hah.
You know you're happy about it.
Is she worried about me...
...because of the new virus going around?
I figured she only ever had games and anime on her mind.
I'm a little touched.
Well...
I wanted to see your homework from the other day.
And I got to see your face while you were sleeping...
...so don't sweat it.
Get out!
Kagami!
Miyuki-chan's here to visit you!
Okay!
I'm sorry to intrude.
Sorry you had to come on a day off.
Is it all right for you to be up?
This is a little something.
Thanks.
I'm a lot better now.
My fever went down after I took some medicine.
Here.
Flowers and fruits! I'm overjoyed!
Have a seat.
Thank you very much.
I intended to visit earlier with Izumi-san and everyone...
...but my schedule hasn't been very forgiving.
It's okay.
I brought some materials from the student council meeting.
Thanks!
If you could take a quick glance without straining yourself...
Also, here are the budgets for each club.
And what else was there...
Um...
If I'm tiring you out...
...I'll leave.
This is how a visit's supposed to be!
D-Did something happen?
Actually, Konata showed up yesterday...
It was like, good grief.
That may just be how Izumi-san expresses herself.
The homework may have been an attempt at humor...
...in order to cheer you up.
And perhaps she saw how your face looked while you were sleeping...
...because she didn't want to wake you up.
Is this woman a saint?!
That would've never occurred to me.
Come to think of it...
Is Tsukasa-san not here today?
Good morning.
Are you feeling better, Sis?
As you can see...
She's more laid-back than the person who's sick.
U-Um...
I'm not like this every morning...
Just that I haven't really adjusted to daylight savings...
It's a little late, but welcome.
I completely understand.
I've been having a hard time waking up as well.
Th-That's right.
You get so sleepy these days.
Indeed.
And it's especially warm today.
That's the truth!
It can't be helped.
And you know how our last day off was also warm?
When I woke up, it was already evening.
I spent most of the time sleeping.
It's good to rest when you have a day off.
So I ended up wearing my pajamas the whole day.
I guess I still am.
Those are pajamas?
That's right.
They're quite adorable.
I can't tell that they're pajamas.
Really?
I wonder if I can just stay in them.
You could walk outside in them.
Could I go into a convenience store in these?
It's like an endless loop of dumb and dumber!
Nobody would blink an eye.
NURSE'S OFFICE
It's gone up a little...
No.
That might not be the case.
I'm wearing a wired bra with extra padding...
...which means extra weight.
That has to be it.
I wonder how many grams that adds.
Once you subtract that...
NURSE'S OFFICE
It's over...
I totally screwed up.
I forgot we had examinations today...
...so I wore my character print underwear.
I'm so embarrassed!
I haven't grown at all...
Damn it!
You get to look all happy by yourself!
Yo.
I'm here.
Sis.
I was wondering.
Kagami comes here a lot.
Do you have no friends in your class?
Don't put me on your level.
Are you trying to pick a fight?
Oh.
I thought you were being ostracized or something.
Worry less about me...
...and more about your lack of a social life.
You don't have to worry about that.
Believe it or not, I have around a hundred friends.
And I'm pretty good at social dealings.
And I'm in a party every night.
My comrades and I strive to recover the light stolen from the crystals...
...to save the world from oblivion...
...and rescue kidnapped princesses...
Aren't you talking about a game?!
I haven't seen that person in a while.
Who?
She's probably talking about some friend from a game.
He plays a warrior.
He went somewhere with a lot of monsters to train his battle skills, and I haven't seen him since.
I heard from someone else...
...that he was lying low in the sewers.
I wonder if he's okay.
Everyone's worried since he hasn't come out.
He isolated himself in the game?
I don't know the details...
...but his log-in info implies that he's been online the whole time.
So he's isolated in both the real and virtual world?!
Well, it's the same person in both cases.
That's right...
How did you two become friends?
A huge fishy-looking foreigner was about to take Tsukasa away...
...when I happened to show up.
Using my special fists of fury...
...and beautiful hurricane kick...
...I saved her.
Why do we always end up talking about games?
Well, that's what happens when you run into an experienced fighter.
I'm not sure you should've resorted to violence so quickly...
...but you did a good thing.
The foreigner was actually just asking me for directions...
...but I was having a hard time understanding him when Kona-chan showed up...
Hey!
You were totally at fault there!
And why do you look so proud about it?!
It's that time of year again...
Is something going to happen?
No.
I was thinking that the Tigers' season had started...
You don't like watching sports, Kona-chan?
You're really athletic...
...so I thought you might enjoy it.
Because if the game goes into extra innings...
...the schedule for new anime gets all messed up.
Sometimes, the show gets cancelled altogether.
It sucks when you lose something you like.
When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake, Kagami?
Why you asking?
I was wondering if you were the type to save your favorite for last.
I usually eat my favorite stuff last...
...but with strawberries, it depends on the situation.
Then do you grill both sides of an onion beef tongue?
Onion beef tongues?
It's done in no time anyway...
...but it'd go even faster if you did both sides.
You can't.
The onions will fall off.
Don't you add the onions after the meat's done?
Then the onions won't be grilled.
But aren't the onions just a topping?
You have no idea...
W-Well...
Wouldn't they both work...?
Do you think the head of a chocolate cornet is the fat or thin end?
The fat end?
We think the same.
Seriously?
Then which end do you start eating from?
Don't you cut off the thin end...
...and eat it with the excess chocolate?
Have you ever made any real-life friends besides us?
I guess I had a really close friend back in middle school.
So you had one.
I haven't been in touch for a while...
Wonder what she's up to...
She wrote in our graduation book...
...that her dream was to become a wizard.
So she was one of your kind?!
Good lucky!
It's finally time for Lucky Channel!
Now being broadcast on TV!
Okay!
Hello to everyone who's meeting us for the first time!
I'll be your navigator, Akira Kogami.
I'm Shiraishi.
Who're you?
Just kidding!
This person will be helping me out from now on.
Minoru Shiraishi-san!
Da-dada-dum!
Uh...
I'll be serving as Akira-sama's assistant.
I'm Minoru Shiraishi.
Nice to meet you.
Say what?
You're such a stick-in-the-mud.
Come on.
We're on TV now.
Be more crazy!
Just kidding!
Sorry.
I'm not used to this.
Okay!
Let's get rollin'!
We've received commemorative postcards from lots of people!
Ah, right.
Um...
This is from Berryz Lover in Osaka.
Congratulations on Lucky Channel making it to TV.
Thanks!
By the way, I have a question for Akira-san.
You are a well-known super idol.
How much exactly is an idol paid?
Please let me know.
Pay?
That's a rather direct question.
Y'know...
What's the point in even asking that?
A-Akira-sama?
Well, if you really want to know, I'll tell you.
To be frank, it jumps all over.
Sometimes, it's just cheap pay...
...and then there's your agency.
I'm still on a fixed salary...
...so who knows how much they're skimming off.
And I've been working since I was three...
...so all the money still goes to my parents.
They, like, give me an allowance.
And boy, do they skimp.
Come to think of it, Mama's been buying a bunch of name brand purses recently.
Is she paying for that with the money from this show?
Don't mess with me!
Am I supposed to be Cinderella?!
Wait...
Just because Papa hasn't sent you any money recently...
Hold on!
...doesn't make me your piggy bank!
You don't have to bring that up!
Oh no!
It's time to say goodbye!
Akira's so sad!
And so...
Send us any questions or comments about the show, please☆!
Shiraishi-san, ask them with a please☆!
Then we hope you'll be back next time.
See ya!
Oh, yeah.
Are you seriously going to show up in the actual show?
Who told you that?
The four of us don't karaoke together very often.
I rarely come to these places.
C'mon. C'mon.
We only have two hours, so start singing!
You don't need to rush us.
We still have time.
This is kind of exciting.
It's really fun.
It feels really good when you sing.
Huh?
Where's the catalog?
Catalog?
The catalog.
The catalog, is it?
You know.
The thing with all the song numbers in it.
This?
Yes.
Then I'll start!
You move fast!
And she already queued up three songs!
It'll be a waste if you don't load up the list.
What's this song?
Space Ironmen Kyodain!
You've gotta start with this one!
Never heard of it.
From Da! Da! Da-Da-Da-Da Planet Dada!
Go for it, Kona-chan!
Konata!
Comes the Earth Invasion Robot Army!
You're too loud!
Turn it down!
Take to the sky, big brother!
Why does she know this song?
Skyzel!
Run, little brother!
Granzel!
Two arms of Scrum-metal!
With a flash, it's a galaxy of fireworks!
Go! Go! Jet! Go! Go! Car!
Space Ironmen Kyodain!
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Konata.
So sleepy...
Why am I always so sleepy...
...the day after I get a lot of sleep?
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of sleeping a lot?
Next time:
Effort and Results.
「Effort and Results」
Look forward to next time!
Right?
Doesn't it stink?
Sure does!
Golden Week's almost over...
Did you already take care of your homework?
Not yet, actually...
You know how you can't help having fun on long vacations?
We're in trouble now!
Right, Sis?
Sorry.
I'm almost done.
But you've been playing with me the whole time...
Effort
and
Results
Thanks for the food.
I have a
question about this part...
How would I know
the answers if you don't?
Aren't you in college?!
Go wake up Tsukasa already.
No way.
She's not gonna wake up.
Wake up already!
Dad and Sis sure are late.
Didn't they have a
ground—breaking
ceremony this morning?
What...
...time is it?
I'm home.
It's already noon.
Welcome home.
Good morning...
It's already past noon.
I can't believe how
you can sleep so much.
Did you see the special final episode of Apron of Love last night?
Nope.
I fell asleep halfway through.
You were asleep?
It got really crazy!
A guy balanced a red wash basin on top of his head at the end!
Kagami!
You have a call from Miyuki-chan!
Okay.
Would you like to hold a study
session for checking homework answers?
Sounds great!
Let's do that!
Kagami!
You have a call from Konata-chan!
How about we do a study session for finishing off homework?
Wait one sec!
You're just going to copy my answers, aren't you?!
So let me copy your homework.
Right to the point, huh?
You can copy them...
...but if you don't do the homework yourself...
...you'll totally bomb the test after vacation.
You're right...
We'll only end up hurting ourselves...
I'm good at winging stuff the night before, so I'll be fine.
So let me copy.
At least pretend to be guilty!
I'm sorry to intrude.
Oh, welcome!
Welcome!
Oh.
Are you also here to study, Izumi-san?
No.
She's just copying.
Anyway...
You've barely touched it.
What were you doing during break?
Um...
First Day
Twenty-three pages of math...
Twenty pages
of world history...
Finally made it to
the Imperial Gate.
Thirty pages of English...
We have five days of vacation.
Assuming five
hours spent a day...
No, four hours...
That means 1.15
pages of math an hour.
Second Day
Getting a lot more
experience than I expected.
Oh no!
I haven't done any work today!
Wonder how much
more I need for a level.
Um...
I have three days left...
So let's go
with six hours a day?
Found a loincloth!
Third Day
Nobody remembers
the name of the guy
who spent ten years...
...watching over new workers.
This is starting to
get really slow.
It's Yutaka.
Well, I'm almost maxed out.
Two days left!
If I cram for the last two days...
So all that's left is...
Fourth Day
Golden Week's almost over...
Did you already take
care of your homework?
How about we do a
study session for
finishing off homework?
I wanted to do everything just as planned...
Mission failed.
Shouldn't have even bothered.
You're even worse!
So she ended up doing it herself, huh?
I guess she's still a hard-working girl deep down.
But her accuracy rate is too much for me to bear!
Pathetic...
Just pathetic!
Howdy!
Did y'all have a fun vacation?
Then again...
You had bunches of homework...
...and a test right after vacation...
...so you couldn't have been having fun the whole time.
It barely felt like a vacation.
So sad.
Too bad I just let loose and had a blast!
Teacher.
I also let loose and had a blast!
Hey.
Aren't these things designed so you can never get anything?
Depends on what you're going for.
Some things are especially hard to grab.
Right?
I could never bring myself to touch one of these machines.
Incredible!
Nah.
I already knew this one was gettable.
So maybe...
...if I went after that one...
I might actually get it.
Is that what you're thinking?
Nope! No way!
B-But...
...I guess I'll give it a try.
So you wanna.
Go for it, Sis!
Thought I had it...
Too bad...
Huh?
No way!
Why?!
A great person once said...
...that operating a UFO catcher is like opening a savings account.
Smart guy...
Not again!
Screwed up!
Here are your scores!
I was hopeless...
You achieved Taiko Rank 1!
You've got a great sense of rhythm, Kona-chan.
You achieved Taiko Rank 5!
Nah.
It's got nothing to do with rhythm.
The skills you pick up from gaming
end up being pretty useless in real life.
You're living proof of that.
You're strong, Kona-chan.
Pretty much.
How much time has she spent on this stuff?
Izumi?
Izumi's absent today?
Ms. Kuroi.
You have a call from Izumi-san.
Yes.
It's me.
Teacher, I'm terribly sorry...
...but I need to take a sick day...
That's unusual, Izumi.
Did you catch a cold?
No.
It's a bad case of May sickness.
I can barely move...
Just get your butt down here, now!
Hey!
We're leaving.
Why is your bag so full?
Testing starts tomorrow...
...so I have to take everything home for an all-nighter.
Don't tell me...
...you're going to cram all that tonight?
Honestly...
Waiting till the day before a test to take your textbooks home...
...is way too late!
But this is how I always wing it.
You sure sound confident.
Well.
Show me how good you really are then.
Modern
Literature
Math
English
First Semester Midterms
Okay!
Time to return your tests!
I want my mommy!
So-so, I guess.
How'd you do?
You probably shouldn't ask...
I worked hard, though...
Well, now...
What about Miss All-nighter?
Just fine. Thanks for asking.
That's just wrong!
So tired...
I don't feel like doing anything...
Come on.
Let's go.
But you still ended up wandering around with us, huh?
Comp Festival!
Discount on all QUO cards!
Gotta collect 'em all!
Okay.
Time to get a job.
You're so easy to read.
Seriously...
I've never heard of anyone being absent for May sickness.
I can understand how she feels though.
Doesn't it say sickness in the name?
Shouldn't it count as a serious disease?
Do you seriously mean that?
What exactly is May sickness again?
Miyuki.
Tell her.
Let's see...
It begins with the feeling of achievement one experiences...
...after accomplishing a major goal such
as getting into college or getting a new job.
When new relationships beginning in
April don't work out as well as you'd like...
...you are unable to keep up with the gap
between the new life you imagined and reality.
As a result, you feel helpless and weary.
So plain lethargy might not be considered May sickness...
Besides, it's got nothing to do with...
...second-years in high school like us.
I'm always pumped by the change of pace in spring.
Oh, really.
Still, while I'm not as bad as Konata...
...I do feel unusually tired this time of year.
Once I'm home...
...I can't bring myself to do homework.
Me too!
Nobody's gonna comment?
Why are you sighing, Miyuki-chan?
I'm embarrassed to be saying this at this age...
As embarrassed as I was about the contacts matter...
...but I've been avoiding the dentist's because it terrifies me...
...and I got a cavity the other day...
It even hurts when I drink water.
Isn't that...
...normal?
I'm pretty scared of the dentist's myself.
But why did you avoid the dentist's...
...until your teeth started hurting?
Strangely enough...
Even when I know that my teeth will end up hurting...
You still don't want to go to the dentist's, right?
When the pain first starts...
...you choose not to go to the dentist's...
...while you can still live with the pain.
Is the dentist really that scary?
I've never needed to go so I don't know.
You've never gone to the dentist's?
Lucky you...
There's that hospital smell...
Or the nerve-wracking wait.
Ooh! Ooh!
And the sound of the drill gets me every time!
Change Getter!
It's terrifying!
But guys probably like to go to the dentist's, right?
Why?
Aren't drills like a man's romance?
Dinosaur Empire!
I've heard they love it when robots fight using drills!
But they probably don't like having their teeth drilled...
I've been wondering...
Aren't the receptionists and assistants...
...usually pretty ladies?
Now that you mention it, it does seem that way...
Wonder why...
Perhaps it's one of their hiring criteria...
Exclusively beautiful assistants and drills, huh?
That does indeed sound like something geared towards males.
Then...
What would a dentist's office for females be like?
You'd have to get rid of that smell first.
And switch the patient's chair for a soft, auto-massaging recliner.
Then they should also utilize aromatherapy, right?
And include a foot massage while you're being treated.
That sounds nice.
And to numb the pain, they let you play games.
It might be a little difficult to play games at the same time...
But it's a good way to distract you from the pain.
They could give you headphones and play your favorite songs.
Sounds good.
That would also be nice.
But I still don't like the dentist's.
That's true.
What's this?!
What's wrong?
Well...
They're animating another series I like...
...but they're using a completely different cast from the drama CD.
Don't get it.
Was this the work of a higher power?
Personal issues?
Money?
I never buy drama CDs...
...so as long as the voices match the original characters...
...I don't care who they use.
It doesn't work that way, Kagami.
People who have gotten used to the drama CD...
...feel like something's wrong when they start watching the anime.
It takes a while for the feeling to go away.
Well...
...there's one good thing that comes out of this.
What's that?
Drama CD and anime.
You can enjoy two different worlds through them.
Two for the price of one.
You're a die-hard fan, huh?
Thank you very much!
Well...
One of us will be taking Miyuki-san's leftover nugget...
Let's say it goes to whoever wins a staring contest.
Wha—
You're like a little kid.
A staring contest?
That sounds fun!
Kagami's probably gonna lose.
Did you say something?
Then let's go...
Stare-down!
That was...
...so bad!
Wow...
You...
You didn't even look human!
Hey, you guys are overreacting.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
There was a long line for the restroom.
Did something happen?
Hey.
Show that face to Miyuki!
No way.
It was incredible, Miyuki!
I've never seen anything like it!
Fine then.
It's amazing every time I see it!
That face may come in handy
during the talent stage of entrance exams.
That's it, Konata!
It'll get you into college!
Guaranteed!
I'm not exactly thrilled.
There was this thing on TV about the average
number of books a person in Japan reads annually...
...and they said to omit manga and limit the count to normal books.
Well, manga's...
Do light novels count?
I'm not sure.
Light novels should be okay...
What about picture books?
Since they're called books, they might count...
Other fantasy stuff like Harry Potter is considered normal...
So what do you call a normal book?
And the TV show ended by saying...
...how young people are becoming increasingly illiterate...
...but doesn't browsing the Internet and blogging...
...actually improve your literacy?
I get it, and then I don't...
Yo.
Let's get going.
Wait one minute.
Sorry.
I can't go home with you guys.
Do you have something to do?
That's unusual.
I started working.
Wait!
She actually got a job!
Is Comp Festival really that important?!
Anyway...
Konata sure surprised me.
She sure did.
She really got a job.
I thought she was just joking.
That's also true...
...but I was talking about how somebody actually hired her.
Th-That's a little harsh...
Besides...
I can't picture her doing manual labor.
Th-That's true...
I wonder where she's working.
Maybe at a bookstore?
Since she likes manga?
Excuse me.
I'd like this.
Hold on.
I'm busy right now.
Ka-ching!
I hope she doesn't get fired...
Then how about a convenience store?
Excuse me.
I'd like this.
Fourhundredninetyeightyen.
Exactchange.
Thankyoupleasecomeagain.
Doubt it.
Then what about a fast food place?
Fresh Salad
Ice Cream Cone
Vanilla
Chocolate
Strawberry
Smile
I'm smiling. Gotta problem with it?
I don't see it happening...
I guess that also eliminates a family restaurant.
Welcome.
I wonder where she's working.
Traffic survey?
No way.
Video rental store?
Not too sure about that.
A bar.
Nah.
Pizza delivery.
No driver's license.
Supermarket cashier.
Impossible.
Cram school teacher.
Unthinkable.
A bread factory!
That leaves...
Let's ask her tomorrow.
Hey, Konata.
Where're you working?
Tell us!
Just a normal costume café.
It fits her so perfectly!
But should she really be working there?
Good lucky!
I'm Akira Kogami!
This is the second episode of Lucky Channel!
Akira's going all-out!
O-kay!
Next to me...
...we have my wonderful assistant!
Minoru Shiraishi-san!
Take it away!
For-For-For-For—
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
I'm just a beginner...
...so I hope that you'll just remember my name.
Yes.
Clap. Clap. Clap.
Okay!
This segment's only just begun...
...but we already have an eruption of messages from everyone!
Akira's super happy!
Thanks!
Man...
This is really something.
I suppose you could call this...
...an indication of Akira-sama's popularity.
Wha—
What?
I saw today's episode.
Yes?
Didn't you show up?
In the actual show.
You were in it, weren't you?
They were gracious enough to put me in.
Whatever.
Oh, yeah...
What scene were you in again?
Uh, I believe...
...scene 45 in part A.
The classroom scene right after vacation.
Now I remember.
You didn't have much of a presence so I forgot.
Well, I only had one line this time.
Whazzat?!
Not good enough for you?!
No! Absolutely not!
Not sure a newbie should be actin' that way.
Y'know, back when I debuted...
Debuted?
How old were you then?
Three.
I was happy just to get any lines then.
Quantity isn't the issue.
You're absolutely right.
My nerves were a wreck after
being surrounded by so many veterans.
It was an educational experience!
You were pretty stiff.
Stiff as a board.
Ooh, look! I'm an amateur.
Y'know.
That was way too...yeah...
Do it again right now.
Here?
There's a chance you'll appear again, right?
I suppose...
Then you better practice some.
I'm offering you help here!
Yes, ma'am!
Please help me out!
Gimme the script.
Which scene was it again?
Scene 45.
This one, huh?
Then I'll be Ms. Kuroi.
Please do.
Ready and...
Action!
Howdy.
Did y'all have a fun vacation?
Then again...
You had b-b—
Bunches.
Bunches of homework...
...and a test right after vacation...
...so you couldn't have been having fun the whole time.
It barely felt like a vacation.
What was that?
No good at all.
That line had no feeling to it.
Feel—
Here!
Right here!
You gotta make 'em feel it right here!
I'm sorry.
If you're just gonna read your lines, a monkey could handle that.
A monkey can't...
It's time to say goodbye!
Time just flies...
...when you're happy, right?
And so...
Send us any questions or comments about the show please!
We'll see you next time.
Bye-bye!
So yeah.
What were the regulars like?
What do you mean?
Y'know...
Does it look like anyone's going to get knocked off?
Aren't they all like fighting with each other?
No...
It didn't look that way to me...
Then you're supposed to...
You're amazing, Kona-chan!
You were very passionate.
Hey, Konata!
Are the other two songs like this?
There's anime stuff along with the SFX stuff.
That's not what I meant!
Sing something the rest of us know!
I can sing whatever I want.
Let's see...
Here's the remote.
Come on, Tsukasa.
If you don't order a song...
...we'll end up listening to her endless medley of anime songs.
I'm okay with that.
This is actually quite fun.
Even you, Miyuki?!
Sorry if I block anyone's view.
I'm gonna stand this time.
Now what?
If you don't stand up when you sing...
...your voice can't truly shine.
You're gonna sing even louder?!
Actual footage from the show!
This is kinda cool!
Looks like it was made way before we were born.
ZARADO!
ERADO!
GARADO!
SHINE, JANKERU!
OH! OH, OH!
HIGH IN THE SKY!
OOH, OOH!
USE SKILL, POWER, AND SOUL!
Here are your drinks!
Thanks.
ZABITAN!
TAKE THAT!
EVIL!
TAKE THAT!
Who ordered the oolong tea?
GABURA!
That's me.
OH! OH, OH, OH, OH!
The iced lemon tea?
ROAR, JANKERU!
That would be mine.
The orange juice?
AKUMAIZER 3!
Over here.
The ginger ale?
THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH TO TAKE!
Sorry.
Could you just set it over there?
OH!
ONLY ONE PATH TO TAKE!
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Kagami.
When you buy juice from a vending machine...
...and put in a 200 yen coin and get back a
50 yen coin and a 10 yen coin as change...
...it's like, winner!
But when you ride the train...
...and try to buy a 150 yen ticket...
...and put in a 100 yen coin
thinking that you have five 10 yen coins...
...but once you put in four, you find out you're short one.
Since you have no choice, you put in another 100 yen coin...
...and get back nine 10 yen coins...
...and it's like, loser!
Next time:
「All Kinds of People」
All Kinds of People.
Look forward to next time.
Oh, yeah...
We switch to summer uniforms today.
Someone like Konata will probably show up in her winter uniform.
At least one person in our class will forget.
Good morning, Sis.
There's one in this house.
All Kinds
of People
Rats!
I forgot to sign up for the TV drawing.
Bah.
I kinda wanted the prize.
An apron from Apron of Love.
Not enough love.
You forgot because you don't have enough love.
Not really.
More like I've been busy with student council stuff and tests.
Nope, nope.
Those are just excuses.
I've never forgotten.
Don't put me on the same level as
someone who only ever thinks about having fun!
And the way you put it really pisses me off!
How do you win a drawing?
To put it simply...
Love!
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just a loveless woman.
Well...
If you jot down the usual stuff...
...you're not going to win.
What do you put on yours?
Stuff that'll help me win.
How?
Good handwriting is a fundamental must.
You have to design a postcard that just begs to be drawn.
Like what?
Like...
Use a fluorescent marker to draw a border around the postcard.
That'll stand out.
Then you add a picture related to the prize.
A picture, huh?
I can't draw very well though.
In that case...
...just send in as many entries as you can.
I can probably handle that.
But...
No matter how many you send...
...write each one out without using a printer.
And send out a hundred each time.
A hundred?!
Isn't that normal?
Wouldn't that cost a lot?
You're fighting for something you want.
That calls for passion and guts!
But wouldn't it be cheaper just to buy it then?
Some things in this world can't be bought with money.
Can you fit a hundred postcards in a mailbox?
You don't send them all at once...
...but a few here and a few there.
And over the course of a few days.
Depending on who's running the drawing...
...you might get caught.
Well, sometimes you're better off without the tricky stuff.
And sometimes it's the exact opposite.
So what do we do?
Like I said...
Love!
Yeah, yeah.
Anyway, if you want to win...
...glance through free newspapers and flyers...
...and look for drawings that
probably aren't going to attract many people.
You'll have a high chance of winning.
I'll give it a try!
Where's the love in that?
You know, for twins...
...you don't look anything like each other.
That's 'cause we're fraternal twins.
So it's more like comparing sisters.
Identical twins look exactly the same...
...but fraternal twins can be...
...pretty different in appearance and personality.
I see.
Tsukasa is laid-back...
...but Kagami is pretty crazy.
What was that?!
If you had the same hairstyles with the same ribbons...
...you might end up looking the same.
Kona-chan!
No good.
Kagami could never be the cutesy type.
Zip it!
Don't insult me with your weird fantasies!
Can you use telepathy?
You know.
With twins...
Even when they're raised separately...
...they end up having similar lifestyles and significant others.
And sometimes they end up marrying another pair of twins.
And when one of them is in danger...
...the other one can sense it from a completely different place.
There are all kinds of mysterious phenomena.
So can't you use telepathy?
Give it a spin.
Abracadabra!
You read way too much manga.
Same with ManaKana...
ManaKana?
I heard that they have a few differences.
By the way, Mana is the careful one...
...and Kana is the optimistic one.
And apparently they sound a little different when they sing.
That reminds me...
ManaKana thought they were fraternal twins for a long time...
...but they recently learned that
they were actually identical twins.
Seriously?!
Is it really that surprising?
The definitions for identical and fraternal twins...
...have changed recently.
Which means that you two could be identical twins.
Your identical traits would be...
You both like sweets, right?
Love 'em.
I guess.
You're both left-handed.
That's right.
What's your favorite color?
White maybe.
Black.
The same colors as your souls.
What was that?!
All this talk about eggs and black
and white cookies has made me hungry.
Nobody was talking about food.
It's suffocating in here.
We just got on and I've already broken a sweat.
It's that time of year.
Hot...
They haven't turned on the air conditioning yet.
H-Hey!
Hot...
Soujiro Izumi
Konata
After a long courtship,
we, Kiyotaka Narumi
and Yui Kobayakawa,
will be tying the knot
on June **.
Ladybug Samba, punk version.
One of my cousins is getting married this month.
So she'll be a June bride.
Sounds wonderful.
How does this...
...wet and gloomy season supposedly signify happiness?
Why does getting married in June make you happy?
The name June...
...is generally said to be...
...derived from the name of the Roman goddess, Juno.
In Greek mythology...
...Juno is known as Hera...
...the goddess of marriage and fertility.
Which is why those who get married
in Hera's month, the month of June...
...are said to receive her protection and blessing.
But wasn't Hera Zeus's wife?
Yes, that's right.
I have this image of Hera being extremely jealous...
...so I'm not feeling this happy thing.
What?
Would you rather wear a dress or a kimono for your wedding?
I would wear a dress.
It's been my dream since I was a child.
I'd also go with a dress.
But a kimono would also be nice...
I wanna wear both!
They have miniskirts and really colorful dresses these days.
A miniskirt wedding dress?
It'd look really cute with lots of frills on them.
Lots of dreams!
Lots of frills!
Right?
You're Angel Salvia.
Wait.
Your hair makes you look more like Daisy.
So a yellow top and miniskirt it is.
Tsukasa-san.
You'd probably look good in a miniskirt.
Really?
Your dress is important...
...but the person you're getting married to is also important.
A childhood friend?
Or a rich lady?
Tough choice to make.
One has lots of money...
...and the ability to cast Beho*mi and l***zun.
But as far as feelings are concerned...
Bianca hands down!
Oh, Kagami.
You're the true love type, huh?
I thought you'd go for the money.
No comeback, huh?
Yo, Konata.
I've got a question about a game I borrowed the other day.
Oh.
Hold it right there, Kagaminya.
Isn't it more fun when you figure it out yourself?
You have a point.
Yep, yep.
Since you understand that you should do things yourself...
...you'll do your own homework from now on, right?
Don't the detectives in manga and TV shows...
...run into an awful lot of murders?
Like in Conan or Kindaichi.
There wouldn't be a story otherwise.
Really?
Couldn't they just solve normal cases?
Normal?
Like travel around Japan in search of missing persons.
Tailing people would translate well into a game.
With plenty of thrill and suspense.
I guess.
You could also conduct investigations into unfaithful wives.
Or look for pets that ran away?
Yep, yep!
But would that be fun to watch?
Probably no fun at all.
Right?
Also...
Cases in real life...
...don't really use any brilliant tricks...
...like the ones you find in manga and TV shows.
I guess not.
Fabricated fingerprints that can't be
detected through a luminol reaction.
Stuff that's a step ahead of forensic labs.
Well...
Anything too good might lead to copycats.
Or be too sensitive for broadcast.
Ah, or that...
The really hard cases end without
anyone realizing they happened or go...
...unsolved.
That'd be wrong in so many ways!
Don't you hate how it's been
constantly raining the past few days?
You're right...
And I used to like rain...
You get soaked...
...and you can't hang clothes out to dry...
...so I've never really liked it.
Why did you like rain, Kona-chan?
Because baseball games would be
cancelled and I'd get to watch anime.
I see.
Sounds just like something you would say.
They have a lot more dome stadiums now.
Is something wrong?
You often see idiots and geniuses
going to the same school in anime...
Cease that immediately.
Bite me!
Get lost, neener-neener!
Isn't that actually kinda strange?
If you put it that way...
...in some recent anime...
...the teacher looks the same age as the students.
Or even younger.
Teach.
YOUTH
HI
IT'S
BACKWARDS
BACKWARDS IS
THE GREATEST ECSTASY
LUCKY STAR DASH!
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS
WHAT'S INSIDE
AGE MEANS NOTHING
IN THE FACE OF LOVE
WRYYYYY~
Yes, Ta*****na-san?
The world's always been interested in watching...
...the gap between physical age and mental age.
Don't get it.
You shouldn't question it.
In fact, wouldn't a student who's
really different from everyone else...
...be the real mystery?
Yeah.
I agree one hundred percent.
I shouldn't be saying this...
...but I don't know how you got into this school, Konata.
You're good at putting stuff off till the night before...
...so you didn't study until the night before, right?
What?
You mean she really did?
Nah.
Well, I couldn't have pulled it off in one night.
That gave me a scare.
But I'm impressed that you actually kept studying.
Did a quiz game come out for DS or something?
My dad set some conditions.
A D-rank would mean a Pippin.
A C-rank would mean a 3DO.
A B-rank would mean a PS2.
Papa Izumi.
You really know how to deal with your daughter, huh?
I've been wondering...
Isn't the real mystery how Tsukasa's in the same school as us?
She said it without even blinking!
Woo-hoo!
Come back in ten years!
I won again!
Damn it!
I can't beat her at fighting games.
She's spent way more time on them than I have.
Challenge to me a different game if you want.
Sure about that?
Then next is...
A quiz game!
N-No way...
I lost to Konata in a game of knowledge?
Unbelievable...
Don't tell me...
...she memorized the question order?
Humiliated.
Her memory's incredible when it comes to gaming.
What should we play next?
Don't be in such a hurry.
Huh? That's weird.
Didn't you have a really easy party game?
How do you know all the games I have?
You could probably beat me at that one.
It just stunk!
You've barely eaten any snacks, Kagami.
Usually, you wolf them down.
There's no real reason for it.
I know.
Dieting for summer?
It's not like that.
Not like you have anyone to show your swimsuit off to.
Shut it!
It's none of your business!
Oh, yeah.
Weren't you guys born on Tanabata?
Isn't your birthday soon?
What about it?
You remembered our birthday.
Seventeen, huh?
Seventeen's right before the big one.
What does that mean?
In the year before a critical year...
...unlucky things begin to happen.
As our birthday approaches...
...I'm getting worried...
...so I bought a bunch of wards...
...and power stones.
That sounds like fun.
Sure is!
I couldn't stop buying them.
And like...
We have wards against rage at our place.
Er, no.
All-purpose ward.
Wards against rage, hah.
Like...
We ensure safe pregnancy and protect
you from traffic accidents at the same time!
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Did you know that your birthday is Ponytail Day?
I had no idea.
But why July 7th?
Because Vega from the Tanabata legend had a ponytail.
Sounds like a stretch.
There's a Japan Ponytail Society...
...and they give an award every year to a
celebrity who they think would look good with a ponytail.
Really...
But I have a feeling that anyone would look good with a ponytail.
Sure about that?
My hair's the shortest...
...so it's barely a ponytail.
But a little ponytail's pretty cute.
Yours also looks good, Kona-chan.
You could go with that on an everyday basis.
Think so?
Sure.
S-Sis also...
Kagami's is...
Fine!
I get the idea!
I'll undo it!
All manly like a warrior.
Sorry about that!
Don't drunks often wear ties around their heads?
Is that supposed to mean something?
Oh, that?
Isn't that just when the guy loosens the tie...
...and tries to pull it off over his head...
...but it gets stuck?
In that case...
...it's a lot weirder that they're always carrying a takeout box.
Takeout box?
The thing Kato-chan from the Drifters carries.
I'm not getting it...
Drunks these days...
...pretty much always have a tie around
their head and a takeout box in their hand.
Right?
I hope Vega and Altair meet this year.
Shine. Shine. Shine.
Hope those rage wards of yours can deliver a miracle.
Mind your own business.
They're giving away all varieties of QUO cards at Comp Festival.
Oh, yeah...
You're always collecting QUO cards...
...but do you ever use them?
I don't.
Then why spend the effort?
Isn't it natural to want any item...
...related to a series you like?
As a fan. As a collector.
Not really...
...if you're never gonna use them...
You can't use them!
You have to take good care of them!
It really pisses me off when I see someone use one.
You're not supposed to use these things!
Much less auction them off or sell them.
Using them makes you a surefire failure...
...as a fan and as a collector!
I really can't say anything when you're so worked up.
In my case, I need at least three.
One for preservation.
I keep it in a special case.
Then one to take out occasionally to look at.
What's the last one for?
An extra.
What's that?
Don't you always want two or three of something you like?
Yeah, yeah.
You don't.
I'm just a geek.
A weirdo.
No.
I kind of understand what you're saying.
You'd expect Tsukasa to be popular with guys...
...but I've never heard anything like that.
Tsukasa's a little plain and doesn't really stand out.
Isn't it because she's got a scary sister guarding her like a hawk?
Did you say something?
I'm not sure if I'm really plain...
...or if it's more that Kona-chan and Yuki-chan are really unique.
Miyuki knows all kinds of things.
And she's pretty.
Has a good figure.
Wears glasses.
Hates the dentist.
Clumsy.
Naturally clueless.
Hey now.
Isn't this getting a little weird?
But it's true that I haven't heard anything about Miyuki.
Maybe it's because she's so pretty...
...that everyone's afraid to approach her?
I doubt that.
She's kind...
...and really good at helping others.
That's true.
Maybe a lot of guys ask her out.
But she turns them down?
Turns them down, huh...
Nah.
Maybe she doesn't realize that they're asking her out.
That's possible.
Yuki-chan can be a little clueless...
...so an indirect approach might not work.
Man, the guys in your class are hopeless.
Doesn't a single one of them have the guts...
...to confess his passionate feelings to Miyuki?
Guess not...
We don't have enough maniacs in our class.
Miyuki-san's type is usually a bigger hit with maniacs.
Maniacs, huh?
Right?
Oh.
It's already this late.
I'll need to excuse myself.
Really?
Please continue to enjoy yourselves.
Then I'll excuse myself.
See you later!
Buh-bye.
Anyway...
Going on with the story...
...that person was actually...
O-Oh?
I-I'm terribly sorry!
Yay!
I-I'm sorry.
Man, oh, man...
Doesn't that always happen?
I did it the other day.
So did I.
Everybody does it at least once.
Right, Konata?
I haven't.
That was definitely an element of moe!
Miyuki-san.
Good job!
Good lucky!
Okay!
Today's another whoo-whoo happy episode of Lucky Channel!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami.
And...
Uh.
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
It's a pleasure.
Okay, okay.
The two of us have now done this show...
Ta-da!
Three times after today!
How do you feel about it, Shiraishi-san?
Have you gotten used to it?
Well...
Not yet...
So sorry.
It feels like Shiraishi-san hasn't opened up to me yet.
And it looks like we're sitting further apart than usual.
Is this what they mean by emotional distance?
Sob.
Th-Th-That's not true!
Shuffle.
Okay!
Let's get rollin'!
Um...
We've got something the fans will love today!
Guess what?
We'll be doing our first
introduction for a member of the regular cast!
Da! Da-da-dum!
Okay, uh...
We'll be introducing Miyuki Takara-san today.
Let's see...
The class representative, well-mannered, kn—
Knowledgeable.
Knowledgeable...
...in both literary and culinary arts. A perfect person.
Shiraishi-san.
You know Miyuki-san, right?
But of course!
She's so wonderful, yeah?
First, there's her glasses!
And then she's pretty as a button.
With those looks...
...you'd expect her to be hard to approach...
...but she's actually a friendly person...
I wish you'd talk that much on the radio show...
You can't stop talking when it's about Miyuki-san.
No!
That's not it...
Well, yeah.
Miyuki Takara-san, is it?
A pretty face.
With large breasts.
And other various elements of moe.
Isn't she so lucky to be a pretty character?
Akira-sama, that's a little...
The maniacs love her.
Uh, maniacs is a little...
But you know...
If it's maniacs you want, I'm a huge hit with those lolicons...
Too bad!
It's time to say goodbye!
And so...
Send us any questions or comments about the show, please!
Please look forward to next time.
See ya!
So what's she really like?
Exactly the same.
No way!
Doesn't she like smoke a pack at a time backstage?
No worry of that. She isn't you.
That was fun!
A unique song.
I'd like to hear a song that normal people can enjoy already.
You know the next one, Kagami.
Guess it from the intro!
It's not another weird song, is it?
What was this song again?
Don't know...
Kagami.
The answer is...
It's from FMP. FMP.
And it's Kagami's favorite...
Fumoffu!
Really...
I-I just read the novels...
...and got a little hooked.
Say a day were to come when tears begin to fall...
You're really good, Kona-chan!
You can also sound like an adult.
Isn't she just doing an imitation?
...I would want your back for comfort.
So?
What are you two going to sing?
I wonder if there's anything I can sing...
I don't know very many songs...
Kindness can be very cruel at times...
Anything works.
Look at Konata.
Just sing what you want to!
Um...
Then I'll have a look.
I'm not very confident about my singing...
The more we try, the more we lose sight of the answer.
It's fine.
We're the only ones who'll hear you.
Just take it easy.
Really?
In that case...
If you can see rainbows in our town after the rain has just passed...
Then let's set out now.
Something's about to begin...
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Tsukasa.
Guess what?
I laughed so hard the other day that I couldn't breathe.
Then at school one morning...
I'm already out of time?
Next time:

Okay.
Who can solve this one?
Shiraishi.
You just called on me!
Really?
Then Izumi.
Izumi?
No, I wasn't asleep.
I didn't say anything yet.
Motivation
Issues
I forgot my English textbook!
Why don't you go borrow Kagami's?
They already had English, right?
Honestly...
You're so careless.
Thank you!
You should double-check everything the day before.
Tsukasa tends to forget stuff a lot, right?
Come to think of it...
...Konata doesn't forget stuff like textbooks often.
That's because I'm surprisingly diligent about those things.
Plus, I never take my textbooks home in the first place.
Oh, is that so?
That's not called diligent at all!
But you can't review what we
went over in class without a textbook.
I never study at home.
Since you end up cramming the night before...
But Kona-chan's good at putting off stuff till the night before.
That could be why I forget to do my homework.
You don't forget to do it.
You just don't want to do it.
So show me your homework for Japanese this afternoon.
Already at it again, huh?
I've been thinking...
Miyuki's in your class...
Ask her to show you her homework.
How should I put this...
Miyuki-san's such a nice person...
...that it ends up being hard to ask her for anything...
You know what I mean?
There's this sensation you get.
I get what you're saying...
...but I still can't accept it.
Izumi.
Izumi?
What? She's late?
Stop!
I'm not late!
I was late because I had to help someone!
I usually go around with this guy...
...but I just couldn't get away today!
He was like it's okay, we can split up...
...but the other five of us had gotten one...
...and he was the odd one out...
...which kinda left a bad feeling.
When you've been in the same party for a
long time, you wanna help each other out.
So we all backed him up.
Yeah, friends are a beautiful thing.
Really...
So you were up all night playing online games again.
Kept playing after I logged off, huh?
Izumi.
Izumi?
What? She's late?
Stop!
I'm not late!
This girl crashed into me in the shopping district.
Then she suddenly grabbed my hand and took off running.
Eventually, I learned that she'd stolen some taiyaki...
...and was on the run...
I was wondering what any of this had to do with me...
...but I had no choice but to duck into
a café to hide from the taiyaki baker.
So many potential comebacks...
But I can't!
As a teacher!
As a human being!
I'm down with a summer cold.
Izumi.
What's wrong?
Teacher, I'm terribly sorry...
...but I need to take a sick day...
Hey, now.
Too much gaming again?
The same trick won't work every time.
No, I'm sick...
Let me guess. You've got a summer cold, right?
Winter's over and the weather's nice...
...so stop being lazy and get to class!
So she totally treated me like the boy who cried wolf yesterday.
You reap what you sow.
Are you okay now?
It looks like my fever broke...
...but my throat still hurts.
That means you breathe through your mouth.
Huh?
Well...
You can also breathe through your mouth...
...but wouldn't you usually breathe through your nose?
No...
But Kona-chan breathes through her mouth more than her nose.
Because...
You know?
If a virus enters through your mouth, you get a throat infection.
And if a virus enters through your nose, you get a nasal infection.
So people with sore throats probably had a
higher chance of a virus entering through their throat...
This is when we turn to Miyuki-san.
Yeah...
Huh?
So hot...
Don't feel like doing anything...
Kagami?
About your birthday party today...
How about we hold it at my place?
It's so hot that I can't move a step.
We're baking cookies right now.
I'll go.
Hurry it up.
Welcome!
Happy birthday!
Tsukasa and other.
Don't abbreviate me off!
Happy birthday.
Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san.
Thanks!
Thank you!
And it isn't much...
...but I have presents for you.
I'm so excited!
Open it up.
Matching earrings!
I considered a number of options...
...but I had a hard time making up my mind.
And here are presents from me!
Oh, joy.
Open it up.
[Caption: Chief]
What is this?
Brigade chief armband.
Try it on.
Why should I put this on?!
I figured it would fit you perfectly.
It would go better on you.
Um...
Then what is this...
It cost a fortune...
Wear it with care.
Don't try to make both of us cosplay!
It's barely any different from our uniform.
That's quite a problem.
If it's too big...
Right?
Just sucks.
And it stinks.
Hey.
It's our birthday.
You could hold back a little.
Tsukasa's cookies are always so good.
I baked them with her this time.
Kinda learned as I went.
What's wrong?
Now that I think about it...
...some of these cookies don't taste as good as the others.
Weird, isn't it?
What was that?!
Wonder if this is one of Kagami's.
Might as well eat the cake, too.
Kagamin – works hard only on her birthday.
Zip it.
By the way...
...isn't there always a fight over how to cut the cake?
Why?
You know.
When you cut a cake into a bunch of slices...
...how do you divide up the strawberries on top...
...or decide who gets the chocolate decorations?
My older sisters all love chocolate.
Rats...
I was off.
Wouldn't expect that from Kagamin.
What are you talking about?!
Let's eat!
Let's eat.
What?
My strawberry's awfully small.
What is it?
Do I have cake on my face?
I just discovered another facet of Kagamin's charm.
You sound just like Shin-chan, so stop it.
It's almost summer break.
That's right.
The beach, the pool, and summer festivals...
Are there any other usual events?
Twitch.
Summer is all about the annual celebration!
The beginning of the battle!
The one and only...
Comiket!
No, no, no, no, no.
That only applies to you.
Is that like cricket?
W-Well...
Everyone has their own different thing to do.
Like visiting relatives or something.
Good morning.
Miyuki...
...do you have some kind of regular summer activity?
Let's see...
I'll be taking a vacation overseas again this year.
Again?
She said again?
Stupid bourgeois!
Is that like yogurt?
You said that you started working at a costume café...
Don't you need a good figure to pull that off?
Man...
I've been lamenting my lack of a chest for a while...
...but then this game said...
"A flat chest is a status symbol!
A rarity!"
Word for word.
And when you think about it...
...there is a demand, right?
Which means I'm valuable!
I want to know how a line from a game can fill her with confidence.
Then I guess I'm okay, too.
Honestly...
We have a test coming up.
Should you be gaming so much?
If you would only use some of that passion for studying...
Your grades would probably go up.
If she's so easily influenced...
...wouldn't she become a genius if
someone released a game that promoted studying?
There's already stuff like Moe Drill.
Something wrong?
There's been a lot of juvenile crimes lately.
Whenever that happens...
...all the neighbors say...
He was such a nice boy.
I never would have imagined that he could do such a thing.
Well...
That just means you can't judge a person on the surface.
If you ever commit a crime...
I always figured she would do something like this.
I'll tell the whole world.
Tired...
It's so hot that I don't feel like doing anything.
I really understand how you feel...
...but you never feel like doing anything.
H i i r a g i
Hello, Kagami.
Yo.
Making progress on your studying for the test?
I was tidying up my room.
You know how kinda get the urge to start
cleaning when you're feeling the pressure?
I can understand...
...but study.
Okay!
Let's get a little studying done today!
I'll take a thirty minute break.
I'm losing my concentration.
Time's already up.
Just thirty more minutes.
Thirty more minutes...
Isn't Haruhi about to start?
They definitely cut corners
with those long-winded Nagato scenes.
That Ya***** hasn't been very impressive recently.
They're already flaming away.
It's already two?
Not going to happen today.
I'll go to sleep and wake up early to study.
If I wake up at five...
...I can sleep three hours.
I ended up killing time yesterday by
reading manga and watching anime.
Sounds like something you would do.
Come to think of it...
You sure have some odd taste in manga and games.
You read manga aimed at boys...
...and mainly play dating sims for men.
My dad reads manga and plays games a lot...
...so I was probably influenced.
I've been watching him from the side since I was little.
I can understand the manga...
...but playing dating sims in front of your daughter?
What kind of father is he?
Doesn't your mom have anything to say...
...with both of you like this?
I don't have a mom.
She died when I was really little.
Really...
So I'm always doing housework...
...which is why I'm way better than Kagami is.
Don't say stuff like that...
...when the mood isn't right for comebacks.
Tsukasa's also good at cooking, right?
I'm not sure if I would say that I'm good...
...but I love it!
I wonder how good Miyuki-san is.
She looks rich...
...so maybe she's bad at housework.
Cooking, is it?
To be honest...
I only help out from time to time...
...so I'm not very skilled at housework.
It's quite embarrassing.
Oh! Knew it!
But Miyuki's so good at everything else...
...that it doesn't really feel the same.
You can't just assume that she's bad when she says so.
I see...
No, not at all...
Then what about our teacher?
I heard that she lives by herself...
...but she looks like she could be a slob.
These days...
...ya can get by without knowing how ta cook!
Ya got your convenience stores.
Just kiddin'!
I can cook.
About as well as your average person.
Please don't make jokes that sound like they're true.
Tsukasa still has my dictionary.
Tsukasa.
Sorry. Could I get my dictionary back?
I-I was doing a little cleaning for a change of pace...
...yeah...
You too, huh?
Yo.
What's up?
The people at work are trying to
come up with a new menu for summer.
So you do stuff like that, too...
And wait, did you give up on studying for the test?
Spicy stuff's good when it's hot outside...
...so how about super spicy ramen?!
Go with something you would usually find in a café.
Then a super spicy parfait!
Could you stop skipping the thinking process when you respond?
I can't stand...
Why doesn't our school have swimming class?
We have a pool...
I'm actually relieved by that fact.
Why's that?
To be honest...
I can't open my eyes underwater...
...so I can't really swim.
It's quite embarrassing.
Why can't I have all your "weaknesses"?!
The summer Comp Festival is finally about to begin!
That's right...
This is why I started working...
A festival...
You bring so many fond memories!
Why are you pulling out an ancient reference?
Man...
When the customers start getting excited with you...
...doesn't it feel like everyone's
pumped up together for the festival?
Use some of that passion on academic endeavors.
Having trouble getting to sleep.
Guess I'll read until I fall asleep.
I happen to have some stuff I just bought.
So much for falling asleep...
It's already morning.
And now...
...I'm feeling really sleepy...
Stare...
I can understand turning off your phone around priority seats...
Because of pacemakers and the like.
But why do they ban cell phone use for the whole train?
Because...
...you'll disturb other people when you talk?
But you know...
Aren't trains already noisy with people talking anyway?
That includes men and women of all ages.
I guess that's true...
Are you going to work at the temple
for summer festivals like you did for New Year's?
Nah.
I don't work in the summer.
Oh, yeah...
It's getting to be that time of year.
Huh?
Weren't you on a diet?
Nah.
Maybe it's because of all the studying...
When I weighed myself yesterday, it was down.
So I figured it'd be okay.
That was quick.
And like, you're weak.
Good morning!
Kona-chan, good morning!
Huh?
What's wrong with Kagami?
Konata!
My weight already...
...went all the way up in like the blink of an eye...
It's 'cause you let go and started snacking again.
And wasn't that a senryu?
My weight already
went all the way up in like
the blink of an eye
I only...
I only ate a little...
It's not like a kilo or two
is going to affect how you look.
Why do you get so excited and depressed over every kilogram?
This is why women are hopeless.
Aren't you supposed to be a woman?
Good lucky!
Welcome to another episode of Lucky Channel.
Has everyone been doing well?
I'm Akira Kogami, always running at 120%!
Today...
Nyoron!
Just kidding!
I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
Hey.
What?
Don't interrupt me!
I'm sorry!
This isn't a kiddy ride.
Learn the job already.
Do you want to be dropped from this role?
I'm terribly sorry!
I'll work hard!
Give it my all!
Okay!
Today...
Ta-da!
We have big news for everyone!
Published in the November issue of Comptiq...
Project Fashionable Akira!
I've already received this many postcards from everyone!
Uh.
I think there was another person involved in that project...
Thanks for all the feedback!
Like cowabunga!
I don't think anyone's going to understand a joke from the eighties...
Then I'll reveal the idea I've selected after extensive review.
Like this.
Um...
This is from a Miss Cherry in Satte, Saitama.
Project Fashionable Akira!
Kagami-san's pigtails look great on her.
What if Akira-san also wore pigtails?
Pigtails, huh...
Sounds—
Wonderful!
That's right.
Hair styling is a woman's life!
If I split it in two...
...it might look lovely...
No ifs or buts about it.
Isn't it impossible with your hair length...
But you know.
It's not like long hair is always a good thing.
Akira-sama.
It's gonna show.
It weighs a lot...
It's really gonna show.
Like if you just twitch!
It's a pain to maintain.
And frankly, it isn't in fashion right now.
Guys run their mouth off about liking long hair on women...
Uh.
...but do they have any idea how much
time, effort, and money it takes to maintain?
You're talking about yourself now.
Uh...
You're not in character anymore.
You're no longer Akira-sama.
And nobody ever notices your efforts...
Are you listening?
Hello?
It's already time to say goodbye!
As for what would Akira look like with pigtails...
You can find out more on our homepage or the radio show!
Hope to see you!
Both hands will be waiting!
I made a funny!
Then please look forward to next week.
What was with the attitude?
By attitude, you mean...
Why did you keep cutting in?
That upset about getting burned in the beginning?
No! Just that...
...I just figured nobody would recognize cowabunga now...
Ah, no.
Forgive me.
Uh...
Why don't we start over again?
You know?
Yes.
I heard they're holding an audition for Minoru Shiraishi.
Seriously?!
This is the first I've heard about it!
You can try out if you want.
Try out? Me?
Good for you.
But I'm actually him!
What?
You're amazing, Kona-chan!
You can sing anything!
As long as it's an anime song.
You can sing well...
...in many different voices.
Singing anime songs...
...is all about staying true to the original song.
Okay.
Guess I'll sing.
What are you gonna sing, Sis?
The title was displayed earlier...
...but I didn't recognize it.
Miyuki, you don't know this?
Guess you aren't any better.
I've heard this before!
Weren't you watching the series with me a while ago?
Really?
I still prefer the movie.
Are you an old geezer or something?
Farewell doesn't mean goodbye.
You're good.
Sis is the best singer out of us sisters.
Just a long promise until we meet again.
If you have any regrets left in the place where our dreams were...
...they'll only serve to chill your heart.
Just stay like this...
As many hours as we can...
I want to hold you in my arms.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Miyuki.
Golden Week...
...was apparently derived from industry lingo...
...for the period when movie ticket sales are extremely high.
Next time:
「Ace Shooter」
Ace Shooter.
Look forward to next time!
Summer time!
Beach time!
So Teacher and Cousin Yui are in
charge of supervising and driving today.
Gotcha!
But you know...
The two of you have a lot of free time.
Summer
Events
Sorry to impose on your day off.
It's nothing.
Don't sweat it.
Narumi-san...
You're an officer in the traffic safety department, right?
That's right.
I know all there is to know about traffic law.
He passed me.
Bastard...
Wa-
Hey!
What happened to safety first?
Cousin Yui goes wild once her hand's on the stick.
Guess we'll have to sacrifice Kagami and Tsukasa.
Really...
Isn't she a cop?
Huh?
That's odd.
I lost sight of them.
Teacher, that's the wrong way!
That's a one-way street!
I messed up big time!
I didn't expect them both to fail!
That car's incredible!
Who is it?!
They both have perfect braking and drifting!
It's practically on top of the FDI!
And it's got better acceleration!
It's practically touching the guard rail!
The point of attack will come...
...in the five consecutive hairpin curves ahead!
It's speeding up!
Did the brakes die?!
Incredible!
What's with the (bleep) D-like driving?!
Nanako-san...
You're really good...
...at driving...
Yeah?
You see...
I get sick whenever I'm in a car.
That's why I brought medicine...
But I didn't feel sick at all with you at the wheel.
Like!
I don't have time to be talking to you!
[Sign: To keep our city clean, fireworks are banned between 10 PM and 7 AM.]
Well...
How about we find a hotel?
The clear sky is perfect weather for a day at the beach.
Seriously...
I was getting worried there yesterday.
I'll put on my swimsuit before we go!
You're such a child...!
Konata-san!
Are you seriously wearing that?
And like...
I've never heard of someone wearing a school swimsuit at this age.
Some people have special needs, Kagamin.
Izumi
H-H-How old is that swimsuit?!
Besides...
Why are you wearing a swim ring when you're good at sports stuff?
The ocean doesn't exist solely for wasting effort on swimming.
You should take it leisurely.
Leisure time.
Plus, to meet those special needs...
...you have to wear a school swimsuit with a swim ring.
People with special needs...
...won't be coming to the beach.
Watermelon cracking is the usual event in manga and anime...
...but it doesn't happen much in reality.
I've seen it before...
...but people probably feel like it's a waste.
That's true...
If you blow up a watermelon with a gun...
...you'll end up covered in watermelon.
You watch too much anime.
Have you ever played it before, Miyuki-san?
Since you're rich.
I haven't.
Well, on second thought...
It doesn't seem like something rich people would do.
You have a point.
It was obvious...
...but I guess your eyes don't end up like in manga.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
But y'know, yeah?
A girls only babysitting trip to the beach at this age...
We're some lonely, single girls, huh?
You're mistak-
But yeah...
If the alternative is resorting to bringing something like that...
...I'm all for a girls only trip.
No, I'm...
They're telling people to marry late these days.
Might as well take our time and choose well.
You're mistaken.
My husband just happens to be busy working far away.
I'm already married!
The beach is a mecca for flirting...
...but it doesn't apply to us, huh?
Well, it's less annoying this way.
Besides, this thing...
...probably makes people think
we're sisters here on a family trip.
And a one-two.
What's up?
Well...
It kind of feels icky to sit down when I'm still wet.
I understand how you feel.
Then you can use an air chair.
You're pretty extreme.
Yakisoba
Yakiudon
Okonomiyaki
Ramen
Curry
Tokoyaki
Ikayaki
Fried Chicken
What is it?
My neck's tired.
Really now.
Just as expected!
What are you so happy about?
Because I got something straight out of a storybook beach house.
Look at how the curry is sauce and nothing else.
This is true beach house fare!
That's true.
Usually, you wouldn't be willing to eat something like this...
...but here, it actually tastes good!
The beer they got at the beach is the best!
Generic beer isn't too bad once in a while.
I find it odd that they're charging
300 yen for a single frankfurter.
Yeah!
Maybe they're only half-cooked.
But we'll eat it anyway.
I actually like how their chicken is...
...dripping in grease and over-spiced.
And this plain fried soba...
...is quite nice.
But still...
You couldn't stand eating this stuff at home!
Konata's touched.
Hey.
Does this food really warrant so much praise?
Not really.
Not enough to make you run towards the ocean in a loincloth.
Is that another anime reference?
Drank too much...
No choice.
Let's stay another night.
What about work, Cousin Yui?
I also took tomorrow off.
It's fine!
I-It's freezing...
You're such a kidder, Teacher.
Why is your hair all squeaky...
...after you've been in the ocean?
Dunno.
Maybe it has to do with salt or something.
Right, Miyuki?
That's right.
The main reason would be salt content and UV rays.
What's so bad about it?
Isn't your hair always getting hit by UV rays?
Well...
It'll take a little while...
...to explain that.
In that case...
The reason your hair is damaged by a trip to the beach...
...would be the adhesion of salt
from seawater and the sea breeze...
...which absorbs the moisture from your hair...
...which now suffers from exposure to strong UV rays.
Also...
Whenever you are exposed to strong UV rays outdoors...
...your melanin levels will fade...
...and your hair will become light brown.
And if residual quantities of salt or chlorine remain in your hair...
...they may result in the discoloration of your hair.
The usual reason for hair damage in summer...
...would be UV rays and residual substances.
The above factors cause damage to the cuticles.
When exposed to strong UV rays...
...the cysteine molecules found in strong hair are broken up...
Look! Look!
Timotei!
Timotei!
Timotei!
What's that?
I wonder how other people would see us.
Not sure...
Nothing to talk about...
Probably sisters or cousins?
Probably.
That's all you have to say?
Cousin Yui!
Timotei!
Timotei!
Timotei!
I remember that!
I used to do it!
Yes!
That's the response I wanted!
How old are you?
Mandom!
Cut out the geezer jokes.
What's wrong, Kona-chan?
I just triggered a flag.
What are you talking about?
This is where the event starts!
In order to see both paths...
...don't forget to save often before a split!
No exceptions!
Picture complete.
Perfect!
Bring it on!
No idea what's going on.
Anyway...
...you being like this is why...
Why...?
Why nobody came to hit on us.
Y-You're the one who brought it up in the first place!
I could really care less about that stuff.
So Kagami wanted someone to hit on her.
N-No...
No!
Damn it!
I missed it!
What is it?
I was wondering what you do about hair.
Mine's pretty smooth, so I don't do anything.
What about you, Sis?
M-Me?!
I guess I'm normal.
Actually, today was kinda dangerous.
What?
Well...
You know...
Almost happened...
Oh, that?
I see.
Good thing then.
You were okay?
No problem at all.
Mine ended a week ago.
The timing was perfect.
It really sucks when that happens.
You're right.
It would be sad if you were the
only one who couldn't go in the water...
But using that would be a little...
Yeah.
Makes you think twice.
I've never used one.
That was a candid conversation.
Wh-What about you?
Don't tell me...
What's with that look?
Nothing.
Apparently, this is a true story...
A photo software wholesaler...
...was on his way home from work...
...and got on the bus as usual late at night...
His house was...
...at the end of the bus line.
So...
As more and more passengers got off...
...eventually, he was the only person left on the bus...
The driver thought that nobody was left on the bus...
...and...
...sang "DANZEN! Futari wa ***Cure" at the top of his lungs!
Just a rumor I heard.
It was nothing...
What a relief...
I was so scared.
I'm also...
I'm Sukekiyo.
Where'd you get that mask from?!
Then good night.
Yes.
Good night.
The Inugami Family!
It's so much fun to scare you.
Go to sleep already.
Hey!
We're going!
Okay!
I don't have anything interesting to say.
I'm Tsukasa.
I'm Tsukasa.
Sis!
What is it?
I was scared!
A girl just took a step towards becoming an adult, Kagamin.
Comp Festival is a big hit.
'Cause Japanese people are suckers for limited edition stuff.
If the words "limited edition" are enough to boost sales...
...they could just add it to everything.
That would cheapen the value.
So I went and asked.
Yes.
Clean your room before break's over.
Whoa, flashback!
These textbooks are from middle school.
Sis!
Look at this album!
Isn't this picture of Dad a little risqué?
Right?
That's when I started wondering about Dad's thing.
You look like you're having fun...
...but are you getting any cleaning done?
Um...
Hey.
Do you want these clothes?
If you don't need them, I'll take them.
Then I'll leave them here.
Thanks.
Hey.
Do you want this?
Then I guess I'll take it.
What about this?
This?
Wait!
Don't tell me I'm her trash can...
You end up looking through photo albums and stuff instead.
I know what you mean.
If any old magazines are lying around, I start reading them.
That's right.
Oh, yeah. What about Tsukasa?
She doesn't throw anything away, so it takes a while.
She's still at it.
Tsukasa's always slow to act.
On the other hand, Kagami's always trigger happy.
Why is your impression of me...
...so aggressive?
You saved your textbooks from middle school.
You don't have anything like that?
I left them with my memories at my old school.
No, take them home.
You're causing trouble for the school.
I finally finished cleaning.
I don't think that I'll ever use this again...
...but then I remember how I just used it...
...so I can't throw it away.
Yeah.
There really are people who keep everything.
Tsukasa seems the type.
You seem like someone who even throws away useful stuff.
Seeing as how you ditched your textbooks.
Miyuki.
Go have your teeth taken care of...
...before school starts up again.
I understand...
...but I just don't like it.
Well, I would feel bad about forcing you to go.
If you can't go...
...I'll have him come.
A visit from the dentist.
P-Please wait!
Good lucky!
We've already burst into the sixth episode of Lucky Channel!
I hope that you've all become familiar with this corner.
I'm Akira Kogami!
Lame!
You say something?
It appears that newbie Shiraishi-kun
isn't used to the job and is a nervous wreck.
I'm scared...
So scared...
You're all making his heart race.
Whad did I do wrong?
We went to the mountains 'cause Akira-sama said so.
I hope he gets used to the job soon.
Yeah.
Went to the beach, too.
And he better watch how he talks to the
veterans around here or else something may happen.
I'm doing everything I can to make this show funnier!
Yeah...
The gum was hard...
I just hate that!
But it was fifty-four pieces.
Today we'll introduce a key Lucky Star character...
Fifty-four pieces in my mouth!
But I still worked hard!
Konata Izumi-san!
What else will I have to do?
Hey.
Stop blubbering.
Why me?!
Let's see...
Konata Izumi-san.
Seventeen years old.
Her hobbies are gaming, watching anime, and reading.
Uh...
According to the data...
...she always checks out new shows and books.
She games up a storm on weekends.
So she's a geek.
Uh...
Looks like it...
Come up with something quick!
By geek, you mean that, right?
People who watch House Classics, right?
The ones who watch A Dog of Flanders and cry, right?
Which decade of geek are you talking about?
Are you doing your homework?!
Get with the program!
N-No, uh...
Well I guess A Dog of Flanders had the
whole cutesy, appealing character to soothe you.
But people these days prefer a girl like me!
Cute as a button and pure as snow!
You know what I mean?
If I look right, so do you!
If I look left, so do you!
When you line up for my concert the
night before, you can't take a shower!
That may cause hygienic problems...
...but you still want to see me!
That determination burns as hot as the sun in wait of my arrival!
Until the bandana around your head is drenched!
You know...
They're still customers.
When I'm doing handshakes afterward, they won't stop talking.
Yapping away during MC without reading the crowd.
Doesn't that just blow?
I'm only here because of them.
I have to work hard for them.
Y'know?
Is that how it is...
You'll know soon enough.
How hard it is to be an idol...
Once you've been through the
good and bad, you'll see how it really is.
Can't do anything about fans or clients you hate...
Perfect timing!
Hey, everybody!
Do you know who Konata-san is now?
Then we'll see you on next week's Lucky Channel!
Bye-bee!
Uh...
You didn't even introduce Konata...
More like you introduced geeks.
A-Akira-sama?
You okay?
Do it.
Understood!
What the correspondent saw then was...
Not funny.
Kage sure is awesome.
We get the idea.
So did you order a song, Tsukasa?
I did.
Tsukasa-san singing will be quite refreshing.
I wonder if I can sing it well.
What are you going to sing, Miyuki?
I really don't know many songs...
It's quite embarrassing.
So she went with this, huh?
Go for it, Tsukasa-san!
Tomorrow will be a special, SPECIAL DAY!
A once-in-a-year CHANCE!
OH DARLING!
L!
O!
V!
E!
Lovely!
Tsukasa!
OH DARLING!
Hey, now.
L!
O!
I LOVE YOU!
V!
E!
Lovely!
Sayuri!
Who's that?
Everybody's happy about the CARNIVAL!
I'm gonna make his HEART mine!
OH BABY!
Her name isn't Sayuri Kuninama, right?
OH BABY!
So who is she already?!
What member number was she?
Oh, when I give to you...
...sweet, sweet chocolate of love.
I still won't stand out.
Shut up already!
So I'm gonna resort to my last card!
VALENTINE DAY KISS!
VALENTINE DAY KISS!
VALENTINE DAY KISS!
With a ribbon tied on.
Sha-la-la-la!
Wonderful...
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Kagami.
When you try to get rid of a hanging nail...
...and give it a little tug...
...but then you end up pulling off too much...
...it really hurts, doesn't it?
Also...
...there's the timing for ripping off a scab.
When it starts to itch...
...and you're thinking that it's about time...
...so you pick it off bit by bit.
And just when you're like everything is good...
...it still ends up bleeding!
It leaves some serious damage.
Next time:
Image.
「Image」
Look forward to next time!
I haven't put on my uniform in a while.
It's Kona-chan.
Kona-chan!
Good morning!
My...
Kagami-san.
Tsukasa-san.
A very good day to you.
Why, Tsukasa-san...
Your ribbon is crooked.
Thanks.
Gonna hurl.
What brought this on, Kona-chan?
Yes.
I have become hooked on Marimite.
Marimite?
Are you a kid?!
Image
Hey...
Don't start copying their costumes, too.
Um...
Is that called cosplay?
I wouldn't go that far.
You mean it, right?
I already do plenty of that at work.
Oh, yeah...
You work at one of those places...
But if Kona-chan was a high-class lady...
Feels so wrong that I can't even picture it.
Baseball games have been going over schedule too much recently.
Why do the people watching new anime get shafted?
If you want to watch anime that badly...
...you could get cable or something.
Aren't there specialized channels for that stuff?
If I could...
God knows I want to...
But the cable guys were all like...
You can't get cable...
Yuki-chan.
Good morning.
Good morning, Tsukasa-san.
You look kinda down, did something happen?
Actually, I went to have my cavity taken care of.
You went to the dentist.
Impressive!
Why are there so many follow-up trips
after a visit to the dentist?
I totally know what you mean!
And it isn't just one or two trips!
Miyuki-san.
Good day.
Konata-san.
Good day.
Have you been well?
Thank you for asking.
I'm pleased to see you looking well.
Yuki-chan's so amazing.
She's talking the same way...
...but it doesn't feel weird at all.
And she isn't even questioning the way Kona-chan's talking.
This is the first time I've seen a person say "good day" in real life!
Really?
It appears to be a regularly used greeting...
...at the girls' school my friends go to.
A real school for rich girls is something else.
How refined.
Kuroi...
...told me to collect summer homework for her.
Excellent work, Sebastian.
S-Seba—
Butlers must be named Sebastian, do you not agree?
You do get that impression.
Tell us a funny story, Sebastian.
Ain't happening!
Okay.
Vacation just ended...
...but you got no time to be mooching around.
Schedule
for
Second Semester
Start thinking about your future...
...and put effort into studying.
By future, does she mean choosing a major?
I guess high school is only a temporary stopping point.
But you probably haven't done
much thinking about the future, right?
Why?
Don't insult me!
'Cause...
You chose liberal arts to be in the
same class with everyone else, right?
Tsu-Tsukasa!
You blabbed!
Ah, sorries.
And you told her...
...o-of all people!
Come on...
You should have just been honest.
You hate being lonely, don't you?
There, there.
Shut up!
Hey!
I'm back!
Cousin Yui...
For my summer homework...
I did as you told me and wrote down
random stuff when I didn't know the answer...
...and now I have to redo it all!
Save me!
O-Okay...
But...
If you get help from me, you might have to redo it again...
...if you know what I mean...
She got out of it...
An extension on homework without
an extension on summer vacation...
Maybe I should borrow Kagami's notes.
The sound of cicadas puts me to sleep.
Huh?
I see...
The schedule's off because the baseball game went over.
I guess it can be useful sometimes.
My recorder's off!
Huh?
Where are your glasses, Yuki-chan?
Actually...
They broke this morning...
I forgot that I left them on the chair...
...and accidentally...
I'm terribly sorry...
...but could I borrow your notes for today later?
Sure.
You still got the clumsy thing going.
Konata's Notes
Konata-san...
Horrible handwriting.
So hard to read.
Your handwriting is a mystery to me.
Tsukasa's Notes
Tsukasa-san...
So detailed that
she didn't get
everything down
Hang in there!
They sure are useless.
Here.
Thank you so much.
Good thing we have the same teacher.
Um...
But please keep this a secret...
I don't wish to ruin their good intentions...
I'm starving!
Yuki-chan!
Let's have lunch!
Tsukasa-san.
Konata-san.
Thank you for letting me use your notes.
Nah.
No need to thank us.
I never expected Yuki-chan to borrow my notes.
Well...
It's not happening again.
STARE
U-Um...
Is there something on my face?
In games, when a character who wears
glasses shows up at school without them...
...they suddenly become popular...
But I guess that doesn't happen in real life.
I-It really doesn't.
Unfortunately.
Don't chocolate cornets kinda look like drills?
D-Drills...
D-Didn't we discuss which side of a chocolate cornet was the head?
Like how the thin end looked like the bottom.
On second thought...
...the fat end looks more like the bottom.
Bottom?
That's one big bottom...
And layers of stomach.
When the lower half of your body gains weight...
...it becomes difficult to buy skirts and the like.
That's right!
If you use your waist measurements, you can't get it over your hips.
If it fits your hips perfectly, it's loose around your waist.
You have no choice but to buy one that's too big for your waist...
...and when you walk around in it,
your skirt starts spinning, doesn't it?
That's right!
A body with layers of stomach looks like a cornet...
If you turn it on the side...
...you can play it like a cornet.
If you turn it again, you can...
...put it on your head like a cornet.
Was that supposed to be funny?
Weren't you dieting to make up
for your added summer weight, Sis?
But my weight went down...
...without my waist or hips changing.
No, Kagami.
I can see the fruits of your diet.
Really?
It's plain to see.
They say that when you diet, you lose
weight in the places you don't want to first.
Okay already!
Stop right there!
When reading literature...
...the trick is to keep the theme in mind...
...and understand what the author is trying to convey.
I get it...
I heard that people with poor eyesight end up
with nasty expressions that scare other people...
...but I guess...
...it depends on the person.
Hey, you!
When you said it depends on the person...
...you glanced over at me, didn't you?!
I've heard that thinner eyes make you look prettier.
It makes you look more mature.
Hey.
Stop that!
She's late!
Stupid Konata...
What's she doing?
She's here!
Sorry!
I'm late.
Way late!
Someone who's always complaining
about night games lasting too long...
...shouldn't be so loose with time!
Well, you know...
All the games have been going over schedule lately, so...
I guess it infected me.
Like it's contagious!
So?
Why were you late?
Overslept?
No way.
I'm not a child.
Then give me an adult reason for why you were late.
Well...
There was still plenty of time left when I finished getting ready...
So to kill time...
...I started playing games and couldn't stop...
You suck.
You're worse than a child.
Oh, yeah.
There are a bunch of cultural festivals and
sporting events during second semester, right?
And we have tests soon.
Kona-chan is really athletic so she can do well in sporting events.
I don't like sporting events 'cause they make me tired.
Pretty rare to see such a lazy athletic type.
I wonder what our class will do for the cultural festival.
There isn't anything I'd want to do.
These things...
...can never be decided...
...unless someone wants to do something.
And the person who brings up the idea usually gets put in charge...
...so nobody's willing to talk.
And you have to stay after school to prepare.
You won't be able to watch evening anime.
Knew you'd say that.
It's my turn to cook dinner tonight.
Have to stop by the store on the way home.
What are you going to make?
Everyone's favorite chicken curry!
Everyone in our family loves chicken.
Curry, huh?
Sounds good.
I've heard that letting curry sit overnight makes it taste better.
It works well.
Then I'll make some extra and bring it for lunch tomorrow.
Since there'll be leftovers anyway.
Yes.
This is the Hiiragi residence.
Tsukasa?
Kona-chan!
Why are you calling so early?
The curry...
Curry?
The curry I made yesterday...
I let it sit overnight, and now it's spoiled.
No way.
Really.
Why?
Curry usually doesn't go bad in one day.
Right?
Did you put in anything weird?
I didn't.
But...
...there was mold in it this morning!
So?
Another cornet today?
They taste good, so it's okay.
If you say so...
Oh, yeah...
I just noticed...
...but the difference between when your lunches are...
Mini Hamburger Patties
Fried Eggs
Bacon Sauté
with broad beans and onions.
Salted Asparagus
and Carrots
Made
Properly
...made properly...
Made
Frugally
Grilled Salmon
Okra
(Just boiled and sliced)
Pickled Vegetables
And nothing else...
...or made frugally...
...is really obvious.
Ts-Tsukasa and I take turns making lunch...
I'm not good with housework...
So, it always ends up being simple!
Well, sorry that's the case!
What?!
So you're the type of person...
...who can blow up pots when they cook?!
Nobody in the world can do that.
Yuki-chan's lunch looks wonderful again today.
Not at all.
Today's lunch is just leftovers from last night.
Dinner at Miyuki-san's place...
Is really fancy...
And these are just the leftovers.
Um...
What's inside these fried eggs?
We had some eel leftover last night, so I added it in.
You don't usually see leftovers for eel.
The only thing that's ever leftover at our house is moldy curry.
Your house isn't normal.
Good morning.
Good morning!
Yo!
Look! Look!
My parents bought me a cell phone!
Good for you.
'Cause I did well on my practical exams for once.
Give me your number.
I'll give you mine.
What is my number again?
Um...
Hold on a second!
Um... Um...
Konata.
You have a cell phone?
But I usually forget it at home.
Since Dad's the only one who ever calls.
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a cell phone?
You think?
Keroro!
Isn't it cute?
They bought it for me with the cell phone.
Oh, yeah...
There was a girl in our class who
had a bunch of straps on her phone.
They weighed it...
...and the straps alone were 800 grams.
That much?
That's heavy, man.
Once she took the straps off...
...her stiff shoulders were cured.
Sounds like making a phone call would count as weight training.
Isn't it exciting how you never know
when you'll get a call on your cell phone?
Really?
I hope someone calls me soon!
There's no need to get so excited over a cell phone nowadays.
By the way, did you find your number yet?
Not yet!
In England...
...there was a large struggle between the
House of Lancaster and the House of York.
The two houses fought wearing red and white roses respectively.
Thus, this war was known as the War of Roses.
It lasted from 1455 to 1485.
This...
M-Mine?!
It's my phone!
Somebody finally called me!
Who's this?
Okay.
Confiscated.
Pick it up in the faculty office after school.
What a relief!
She gave it back!
But junk mail already?
Dad?
Still at school.
I was talking with Konata and Miyuki and lost track of time.
It's okay.
We'll be home soon.
Bye.
Just a little late and look what happens.
Yes?
Dad?
I'm still at school.
I'm with Kona-chan and everyone.
You'd think he'd get the idea after calling one of us.
Fathers are always worried about their daughters.
We sure get a lot of junk mail these days.
It's better to make your address hard to guess.
That's how I did it.
Hard to guess?
In what way?
My e-mail address is in roman letters.
iluvgiriswithglasses.
I wanted to go with maids or something...
But maids and shrine maidens are popular and easily...
Hold it right there!
We get it already...
...so don't talk so loudly around the general public.
Your conversation is a bigger problem than the junk mail!
Good morning!
Yo!
What's wrong, Tsukasa?
My cell phone...
My cell phone...!
She left it in her pocket...
It's gone to a better place, huh...
I wonder if they'll buy me another one...
This boy was safe.
Tenacious little guy.
Then the e-mail last night...
The one that said Kagami wanted her notes back...
That was the last one you sent?
Yep.
Did you reply?
Um...
You never respond immediately when you get an e-mail, do you?!
I don't reply to people I can talk to whenever I want.
Reply to e-mails through e-mail.
We see each other every day.
What's the point?
You're going to lose your friends.
Oh, well.
Wasn't that big a deal anyway.
Don't decide that on your own!
And she didn't return my notes.
Tsukasa!
I'm coming in!
Sis.
Wh-What is it?
What's wrong?
This manga I borrowed from Kona-chan moved me to tears.
Good morning!
Thanks for the manga, Kona-chan!
It was great!
Wasn't it so stupid and hilarious?
I-It moved me to tears!
I find it hard to believe you're talking about the same manga.
Here.
If you cry, you're with Tsukasa.
If you laugh, you're with me.
I'm not gonna read it!
I don't want to be classified with either of you.
But I wanna see how Sis reacts.
Is it wrong to want to know more about your friends?
In that case...
Did Attack No. 1 make you cry or laugh?
Laugh.
Cry.
Then what's your favorite manga?
Sgt. Frog.
I can't tell if these two are similar or not...
Why don't you join a manga club, Kona-chan?
Since you love manga.
Well, I'd be willing to do it...
And it'd be a good use of time...
Draw. Draw. Draw. Draw.
D-Did you even try on this?!
Incidentally, Konata-san...
What is this a picture of?
This is Tsukasa.
This was me!
This is Miyuki-san.
Well, I could really stretch and say that you captured her spirit...
This is Kagami.
So I can breathe fire.
My...
It fits Kagami-san's image so perfectly.
What a frightening child.
Cut that out already!
There's a new volume of FMP out.
Right, I guess there's a release date coming up.
I'm heading to Gamers.
Wanna come along?
Sorry.
I'll just stop by a local bookstore today.
I have some other stuff to take care of.
You're supposed to come with me as a sign of our friendship!
What is it?
You sure are clingy today.
Besides, you shouldn't be using words like friendship.
Well, you know...
I wanted you to give me your
purchase points as a sign of our friendship.
So that's your idea of friendship.
I can almost get
the item I want
You've waited so long for me!
It's quiet...
Is she mad about how I mixed up the
ribbons on my pigtails with sunflowers?
Me?
Me?!
To Akira-sama?
You sure?
Understood.
Uh.
Uh...
It started already...
No choice!
Before they change the channel...
Go—
Good lucky!
Just kidding!
Just wanted to say it.
W-Well, we're on another episode of Lucky Channel!
I'm Minoru Shiraishi!
Akira-sama's in a bad mood so...
You said your own name before Akira Kogami.
Do you not understand what natural order is?
No, that's...
Looks like those pigtails of yours have been
getting ridiculously popular in certain places.
I-I wouldn't call it popular...
Don't be getting full of yourself!
I'm terribly sorry!
Besides...
People were expecting Project
Fashionable Akira to show me in pigtails, right?
So what's this?
It's just as you say!
I'll go with twin drills!
T-Twin drills?!
Don't underestimate the Getter's speed.
No. 2, huh?
The age of pigtails is over!
The new thing is twin drills!
Isn't that what Konata said?
Drills are like a man's romance.
Is it now...
Well, everybody!
You can catch the rest of this on
the radio show and our home page!
L-Look forward to next time.
Bye-bee!
Say...
Yes?
About those pigtails...
Ah, the ones I had?
The ones in the real life picture.
Yes?
You had sunflowers on, right?
I did.
That looked awfully familiar...
You can't mean...
How many years ago was it?
H-Hold on a sec!
In one of my...
Eew! Eew!
I was so nervous.
It was cute and wonderful.
Isn't it so nerve-wracking when you're singing your first song?
You wonder if your voice can be heard and stuff.
Miyuki's next, right?
Sing us something full of memories.
Why?
May I have the mic?
Here.
Go for it!
Um, I'm not used to this kind of thing.
Please forgive me if it offends your ears.
Don't worry.
Go for it!
Manly.
I get it.
This ties in to the other Miyuki.
PLEIADS IS IN THE WIND.
Even her singing is manly.
THE MILKY WAY IS IN THE SAND.
Is this a new kind of moe?
You're so cool, Yuki-chan!
WHERE HAS EVERYONE GONE?
I NEVER SAID GOODBYE.
PEGASUS IS IN THE PRAIRIE.
VENUS IS ON THE STREET CORNER.
WHERE HAS EVERYONE GONE?
I CAN NO LONGER WATCH OVER THEM.
NOBODY REMEMBERS THE STARS ON THIS PLANET.
PEOPLE ALWAYS LOOK UP AT THE SKY.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Tsukasa.
Er, I'm already out of time?!
「Don't Need Me
to Have a Blast」
Next time:
Don't Need Me to Have a Blast.
Look forward to next time!
Perfect Weather for
Athletic Festivals
On this day...
...the sunniest day in autumn...
...athletic festivals are being held all over the country.
Fathers and Brothers
Enjoying Athletic Festivals
Man...
I came to cheer for my daughter...
...but I didn't expect such a turnout.
This was worth the trip.
Fathers and Brothers
Enjoying Athletic Festivals
I got some great pictures.
Look.
Dad.
Isn't this a great shot?
If you put it like this...
Which daughter are you talking about?
Don't Need Me
to Have a Blast
Maybe I should cut my hair for the athletic festival.
Go for a really short look.
You're going to cut your hair?
But it took forever to grow it so long.
I wasn't that serious about it...
That profound response...
...must have something to do with a guy!
Stop connecting everything to that subject!
And you stop talking so much!
But if Kagami cut her hair...
That's what I heard...
...but it's not unusual, right?
Ya can't!
Bipolar girls hafta have twin pigtails!
Sorry I have a boring face!
Oh, yeah.
The athletic festival's coming up.
Sounds like a pain.
Wouldn't expect to hear that from a young person.
Kona-chan's good at sports, so she's okay...
...but someone like me...
...just drags everyone down.
Don't worry.
What event are you doing, Sis?
Well, it's Kagami, so you know...
A bread eating contest.
I've been wondering...
Are you trying to pick a fight or something?
So what are you going to do, Kagami?
I guessed right?
Did I guess right?
She pisses me off!
So I plan on doing some
independent training for the athletic festival.
Since fall is for sports.
But are you really training for the athletic festival?
Aren't you actually training for the main event afterwards?
What do you mean?
You want me to say it?
She really pisses me off!
So Miyuki's participating in the inter-class relay.
Well, I can understand that one.
She was originally supposed to be in the obstacle course.
Ball Roll
5m Dash
50m Dash
100m Dash
Obstacle Course
Matsuo
Shiraishi
Yamata
Izumi
Takara
Okay.
No more candidates, right?
I've never tried it so, I can't wait.
That's no good, Miyuki-san!
Your body sticks out too much for an obstacle course.
You'd have to go through stuff.
After I said that, she was switched to the relay.
Isn't that something a middle-aged guy would say?
Oh, yeah.
Did you guys ever have a scavenger race in middle school?
Sure did.
I was called up once...
Me?
For what?
...but he never told me what the criteria were.
Too many unspeakable things come to mind.
Well, just ask Miyuki-san when you don't know the answer.
Don't ask her something like that.
It's impossible to answer.
And she really went and asked...
A character trait that would come up in a scavenger race...
...that people wouldn't want to tell you about?
Perhaps he needed a person with a mole on her face.
Some people are sensitive about that.
I guess it was expected...
...but that was one masterful dodge.
But I'm pretty sure she's wrong.
I enjoy athletic festivals...
...but we have tests right after.
Once the festival's over...
...there aren't any more events, which is kind of sad.
Midterms.
Practical exams.
Finals.
All we have are tests.
The second semester is a drain on your energy with events like the cultural festival and the athletic festival.
Right?
Midterms are particularly rough.
They also say that fall is for reading...
...so maybe I should read something.
It's also a good season to study for tests.
And there's a whirlwind of new game releases before Christmas!
But finals come first.
Oh, yeah!
You two.
Could you stop trying to avoid reality?
I see.
The athletic festival's coming up, huh?
You know about the starter's pistol?
I thought it was a real gun until middle school.
No way...
That was when I knew I wanted to be a cop.
That misunderstanding led to something totally unrelated.
That's right, Konata.
When's the athletic festival at your school?
This Sunday.
Th-This Sunday?!
Why didn't you tell me such an important thing earlier?
But we just got the notice today.
There's no time to waste!
Why's he in such a hurry?
Okay!
Today's the big day!
Show me the fruits of your training!
Teacher!
I'm the type who does well without ever training!
Don't say that out loud!
Anyway, you better give it your all
in the team chicken fight!
The fundamental strategy is to rush
in from all sides and whack 'em good!
So attack from their weak side, right?
But we only need to take their hat...
Hitting people's kinda...
Don't sweat the little stuff.
That's one of those mistakes of youth.
So we're just little runts.
Sis!
Do your best!
Good luck!
Hey.
[ anpan – a Japanese sweet bun most commonly filled with red bean paste. ]
How is that anpan attached to the string?
It's probably attached to a clip or something.
So you can't take it off very easily.
Bring us victory!
Girls must be elegant!
Like an eating contest could ever be elegant!
Ready!
She did it!
That's Kagamin for you.
That person has an incredible camera.
Man, he's so easy to understand.
Hey.
Aren't you in the 100 meter dash next?
Technically.
How can I learn to run fast like you?
It's important to visualize.
Visualize.
Ready!
Set!
That's one ancient visualization.
Goal!
Like that?
Are you serious?
3 meters and 25 centimeters.
So they measure from where your hands reached.
This is it!
That's Kagami.
Dived straight into the sand, huh?
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
I've heard that timing your steps is important for hurdles.
Steps?
One.
Two.
Three.
I get it!
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Set!
One...
Um...
Three, two, three!
One, three, huh?
Um...
I started with my right foot so...
I don't get it!
That was my left foot, so...
Three, three, three.
Three, two, three...
She's knocking every single one down.
You could say she's got talent.
I totally sucked.
Man...
I told you.
I thought my daughter was in this.
A common occurrence.
It's finally time for the last relay.
Yuki-chan!
Do your best!
No...
I told you that my daughter's...
I'll do my best!
Hold on a second!
I haven't even done anything yet!
Okay!
Go for it!
Pedal to the metal!
Awesome!
We're in second!
Not bad.
Sachi, over here!
Okay!
Okay!
We've fallen to third.
This is what you call a race.
Keep at it!
Okay!
They're working pretty hard.
This is getting interesting.
Will Yuki-chan be okay?
Okay.
Okay!
Okay!
Go, Miyuki!
Yay!
Yuki-chan's so cool!
That's our Miyuki-san.
Didn't forget to give the spectators some eye candy.
It's Tsukasa.
Oh, well.
H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne...
Hey!
Can you do something about that?
Sorry.
I chose to play the alto part in a quartet for music class...
...but my fingers are getting numb.
Why did you choose the alto part?
I-I thought the lower part might be easier.
Why don't you condition your fingers on an easy song for now?
You missed most of the notes.
So try to match me.
Ready and...
H-Hold on!
Play by yourself.
Seems wrong somehow...
Try blowing a little softer.
If you relax, it might go a lot better.
I see.
Softer...
That's it.
I'll give it a try.
Isn't she doing more breathing than playing?
I was thinking we should try the cafeteria occasionally...
...but it sure is crowded.
It's pretty overwhelming.
And waiting in line is annoying and exhausting.
Sure sucks.
Haven't you gotten used to this kind of thing from those events?
When I'm not eagerly anticipating what
awaits me at the end of the line, it sucks.
True to your desires, huh?
That's right.
I went to a theme park once...
...and thought that I had lined up for an attraction...
...but the line was for the restroom.
It's a fundamental rule to check what the line is for first.
And I waited two whole hours...
I've also gotten in line a few times...
...and when it was finally my turn...
...the person before me had bought the last one.
Cream Puffs
Sold Out
Terrible...
Don't even wanna picture it.
You're just unlucky.
Look, everyone.
What shall we have today?
Well, I guess I'll go with curry.
Fox
Soba/Udon
Miso
Ramen
Soy Sauce
Ramen
Curry
S M L
Daily Special
A Meal
Daily Special
B Meal
Eggs
Special
They can't screw it up...
I'll go with ramen.
Me too.
I was planning on having miso ramen today.
With lots of corn...
...and seaweed, too!
Kagami's probably having ramen, pudding, and an éclair.
If I have enough room to eat more.
You always have more room.
What about you, Yuki-chan?
I'll have a sandwich.
With strawberries.
Sounds like something you would have.
Right?
By the way...
Isn't a strawberry sandwich considered dessert?
Would it count as lunch?
Th-That's true...
You pick some odd issues to be concerned about.
What about those chocolate cornets you always have?
Wouldn't sweet pastries be considered dessert?
Stupid Tsukasa ruining the punch line.
Anyway, moving on...
Unfortunately, Miyuki-san...
The line for sandwiches is over there.
Typical behavior.
Walking is healthy.
Look.
It's your turn, Kona-chan.
Curry please.
With extra sauce.
Okay.
You're pretty shrewd.
I'll take what I can get.
Okay.
Next person?
Soy sauce ramen please.
With hard noodles.
Okay, please wait one moment.
Okay.
Here's your curry.
I'll go get a table.
Countin' on you.
Thanks!
Let's see...
Next person?
Yes.
Can I please have miso ramen?
Sorry.
The last person ordered the last of our noodles.
We're out of ramen.
Say.
If you're okay with soy sauce, do you want mine?
I'm okay with fox udon.
Thank you, Sis.
Hey, Sis.
You're the older sister because you came out first, right?
Yeah.
I was thinking that it's a good thing I'm the younger sister.
Why?
Because an older sister shouldn't be asking a
younger sister for help with homework and stuff.
I'm pretty sure that copying homework
has nothing to do with that.
Besides, we're twins.
Neither of us is really older or younger.
Stop worrying...
...and do your homework.
But if I were the older sister...
...and all dependable and responsible...
Sis!
Show me your homework!
Again?
You're so hopeless, Kagami.
Hey.
That was too crazy!
You okay there?
Get a grip.
I did it!
Newtype...
...published my...
...very own...
...postcard!
In the May issue...
Saitama province.
The one that has Akira-chan standing on Shiraishi.
Konata Izumi.
Good for you.
Look at it!
Kinda amazed they published this.
A-Amazing!
What a surprise!
This is pretty rare, yeah?
Like, seriously, huh?
Now I have one more thing to look forward to buying!
You don't need to praise me so much!
1,260 yen...
...and 567 yen, huh?
I'll have enough points after one more book.
Then I should just get something...
No.
Then I'd be falling into their trap.
I'm not so easy to fool.
That would be an unplanned purchase for the sake of points.
That's their strategy.
I'm not dumb enough to fall for that trick.
Oh!
I forgot that the fifth volume was out.
Okay!
This works!
Genius
Your total comes to 2,587 yen.
Oh, well.
Extra, yeah...
I can't get it loose.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to let go.
I thought that only ever happened in manga or games...
...but it actually happens in real life.
Guess so.
Which means...
Those two definitely triggered a flag.
Konata...
Fantasy refers to the world of illusion.
Can you not tell the difference
between dreams and reality?
Good lucky!
I come with a dreamer's heart to spread love again!
I'm Lucky Channel's navigator, Akira Kogami!
And I'm the assistant.
Minoru Shiraishi.
We've already reached the eighth episode of this program.
That's true.
If we don't come up with some fresh material...
...we'll be accused of abusing mannerisms.
What was that?
What am I doing?!
No.
I just wanted to try some new things...
You said it.
You know...
Do it.
That's right!
I was walking around town the other day...
...and someone came up to talk to me.
Was it some salon doing a survey?
Geez, Shiraishi-san.
Do you actually mean that?
Of course, it was a fan.
This would never happen to you...
Right?!
I-I-I-I-It wouldn't!
That's true...
Right?!
You're the assistant...
Right?!
Well, keep workin' hard.
B-But...
I've already received this many...
...fan letters!
H-How?!
Hey, Itou!
Haven't I gotten any?!
Incredible.
I feel like a real voice actor.
So I did get some.
Only one?
Your membership has almost expired...
Hey!
This is that stupid online service!
Everybody who's watching!
Please send me fan letters, too!
Big, big, big recruitment drive!
Akira-sama.
Shouldn't we get to today's topic...
Don't get too cocky.
You're easily replaceable.
I'm so sorry.
Ta-da!
I have an announcement to make!
Wow!
We'll be creating figures on this program!
Akira-sama!
The clipboard!
The clipboards upside-down!
Oh, you're doing it on purpose!
You're a genius, Akira-sama!
Actually...
...this project is...
Peel.
P-Peel. Peel.
Don't touch me.
Peel. Peel. Peel.
Huh?
That's weird.
This project is...
Don't touch me.
This is...
Peel.
What's wrong with this thing?!
H-H-Hey, Seishi!
I got it, okay!
A-Akira-sama, calm down!
That's the name of your manager in real life!
This is my prop!
Could you have...
Of course not!
Okay!
Then we'll decide which figure to make based on your votes!
Have fun waiting for us to turn the character into a figure!
Everyone, please vote!
Okay.
That's all for today.
Look forward to next week's Lucky Channel!
Bye-bee!
A character from the actual show's obviously gonna win the poll.
What's with this?
Like I have a chance in hell.
No, you can't be sure yet.
I see.
They're finally going to make a figure of me.
What are you talking about?
This is...
That was great, Yuki-chan!
Thank you for listening.
I never expected this side of you.
Please...
It's embarrassing.
Hey, Yuki-chan.
Let's sing a song together.
Let's do that.
Sing! Sing!
A duet, huh?
Which song do you know?
Let's see...
Then I'll sing a song while we're waiting.
There's never gonna be a break, huh?!
You should also sing!
What is this?
Journey to the West.
Machaaki's Son Goku was great.
Huh?
Wasn't it Shingo-chan?
That was the third remake.
This one ran from 1978 to 1980.
The original series!
How old are you?!
This is a long intro.
This was when the actors delivered the main narration.
Like I would know!
Here it comes!
You're shouting again?!
Born from an egg on a mountain top.
It's in English. Forget that.
That's it after all this build-up?
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Miyuki.
When describing an enormously large object...
...it is described as being super-dreadnought.
The word dreadnought in this expression...
...was derived from a British ship commissioned in 1906...
...the HMS Dreadnought.
In other words...
...something super-dreadnought...
...would be larger than a dreadnought-class battleship.
Well, that was the original meaning...
...but now...
...it's being used in the former context.
Next time:
Just a Feeling.
「Just a Feeling」
Look forward to next time!
Since fall is for reading...
...I've been doing a lot of reading.
That's unusual.
Even though it's for an educational purpose...
...the expenses are piling up.
You don't have to buy them.
Couldn't you just go to a library or something?
They actually have some stuff you'd want.
Nah.
A library wouldn't have manga.
Reading, huh...
They mean books, you know...
Just
A
Feeling
Studying for Test
Can't concentrate...
Well, you have to take a break every now and then.
Like this.
I'll do a little gaming to relax.
It's Ms. Kuroi.
Hey!
Stop playing and get studying!
I'll be real pissed if your grades are bad.
Shit!
The authorities can even find me here!
Don't do this to me, Teacher!
This game suddenly isn't as fun with all these interruptions.
How did you study for tests when you were a student?
Played or slept when I couldn't concentrate.
Nothing special, really.
That's the same as me.
But as an authority figure, I have to be strict.
I get what she means...
...but it still feels unfair!
This time, I plan on setting goals and studying bit by bit.
Sis, teach me the stuff I don't get.
Then let's study together.
So in this case, x would equal...
What is it?
I just realized that my TV show's about to start.
In today's episode...
...a weekly magazine reporter...
...spreads word of the main character's pregnancy.
So you're going to watch TV?
It's okay, I'm taping it.
Um...
I get sleepy whenever there's a bunch of questions I don't get...
Which means you're always sleepy?
I probably shouldn't overexert myself right off the bat...
...so I'll call it a day.
Okay.
I see you're already losing your willpower.
I still can't concentrate!
Okay.
You want a trick for studying for a test?
I was wondering how you study.
Let's see...
If you concentrate too hard, you'll wear yourself out.
In my case, I just follow my usual habits.
So I'm pretty confident about today's test.
I feel so enlightened.
Aren't your usual habits a little risky?
You don't do anything.
But it's so cute...
And its claws are venomous.
My...
So it's actually quite frightening.
Yo.
Kagami.
How'd it go?
This one was pretty bad.
Though I maintained my standing.
So you also do bad sometimes.
Because Sis helped me out.
As a result, I did better than usual.
How about you?
Strangely enough, I did bad.
And I was so sure I'd do well.
Nothing strange about it at all.
It was inevitable.
But you know...
...I was feeling that birds of a feather flock together.
For example...
Kagami and Miyuki-san are both class representatives.
Kagami and I both like games.
Well, different genres though.
You play dating sims and RPGs.
And I play shooters.
I was thinking that Tsukasa and I were both stupid...
...but there was a significant gap this time.
Well, I'm not really concerned about doing bad.
Be a little concerned.
If you slack off because everybody else also did bad...
...you'll fall behind.
Actually...
I didn't make any bets with my dad...
...so I'm not really angry.
You're gonna grow up to be a bad person.
If you're gonna copy Miyuki...
...take notes regularly...
...instead of waiting till tests are coming up.
Miyuki-san is really methodical.
Textbook example of a type A person.
Many people have told me that...
...but I'm actually type O.
You're type O?
Never would have guessed.
However...
Blood Type Primer
According to this book...
...I possess many of the qualities...
...characteristic of type O people.
For example...
It's said that type O people tend to be...
...childish and innocent...
...which describes me perfectly.
Type O people tend to be pushy and possessive...
I guess there's another side to Miyuki-san.
You're probably type A.
But a lot of people mistake me for a type B.
Type A people are skilled in social functions and considerate.
They tend to seek peaceful human interaction?
Does this even match you?
I can be really sensitive to the situation.
Only when it's something you're interested in.
I'm gentle and attentive to other people.
When it involves homework.
What about you, Kagami?
Me?
I'm type B.
So you're laid-back, rude, erratic,
unconventional, naive, and insolent, huh?
What about it?
Then Tsukasa's type AB?
What's that supposed to mean?
Why?
Just a hunch.
If you go by personality...
...Tsukasa would be type A...
...and Kagami would be type B.
We're both type B.
We're twins, remember?
That's right.
I forgot.
And I'm not as laid-back as you are.
Speaking of horoscopes...
...I've also heard of ones for animals and sushi.
Sushi Horoscopes
What are your favorite things?
We'll use your answers to determine your personality.
Sushi?
Let's see...
Miyuki-san is...
So Miyuki would be salmon roe.
Still high-class, I see.
I love salmon roe!
And?
What about Tsukasa and me?
Cucumber roll.
A cucumber roll, huh?
Well, I guess it counts as sushi.
This is pretty accurate.
And what about you?
Me?
Sliced ginger?
It says sliced ginger!
Don't look down on ginger!
Well...
You can't have sushi without it...
...and the horoscope's description is positive.
That's true.
And cucumber rolls count as sushi, right?
Hello?
Konata?
About the blood type conversation today...
Just to make sure you know...
...fraternal twins can have different blood types...
...so your guess wasn't wrong.
Sounded like you got the wrong impression.
Thanks a lot.
You're an honest person.
I'm starting to see the type A in you.
Oh, yeah...
There was a psychic reading on TV.
With those things...
...they'll guess right with some
people and wrong with others...
...so they'd at least make one correct guess.
Kagami...
Don't be so pragmatic...
You'll never have fun in life.
Act more like your age.
Tsukasa.
You worked hard this time.
Kagami did worse than usual.
But she still got a higher score, huh...
Good work, girls.
How should I put it...
You did the best you could...
Ooh.
Tsukasa worked hard.
But Kagami still scored higher.
Hey, Matsuri.
Can't you be more considerate?
Good morning!
Oh, good morning.
I envy how the two of you are such fine young ladies.
Not at all.
You're too kind.
To get such wonderful grades at that Ryouou High...
I wish my children had a fraction of your ability.
It's like...
I'm being praised because I'm her sister...
Nah.
We aren't that impressive.
...so I can't really appreciate it.
Tests are over.
Why don't we go all-out and have some fun?
Sounds good.
How about watching a movie for once?
What's in theaters right now?
There's a great one right now.
What is it?
You could call it a splatter film...
...but it still has some
psycho-suspenseful, shocking horror elements.
Then let's do that!
How about we go home first and meet up later?
Let's do that! Let's do that!
This isn't fun...
I can't have fun like this!
Still got time. What should we do?
Konata sure is late.
Is she late again?
Maybe...
She couldn't have come before us, right?
Honestly...
The movie's about to start.
When did she...
I couldn't recognize you without that thing...
Anyway, we're short on time, so let's go.
Oh, yeah.
Pretend I'm your sister.
Why?
Well...
Then I can buy a child's ticket without looking weird.
Stupid kid.
She whines about her height all the time...
...but then she exploits it when she can!
That was terrifying, Take-rin!
You're so adorable.
I'm a little hungry now.
Me too.
And Tsukasa's probably hungry after screaming so much.
What should we have?
How about a cake buffet?
Sounds great!
The buffet...
A haven for satiating a woman's desires!
They've got so many cakes and drinks.
Sure do.
I wonder if we'll get through every one.
Piece of cake for Kagami.
This store has a time limit of one hour.
You can find beverages in the drink corner over there.
The cakes are located in the showcase over there.
Please help yourself.
Okay!
Bow.
And if you leave an excessive amount of leftovers...
...you'll have to pay an extra fee.
Please keep that in mind.
Then please enjoy yourselves.
What would be considered an excessive amount?
Some people take a bunch and don't finish.
Come on.
Let's go.
That's a lot...
Can you finish all that?
What about you?
This is normal for cake.
No sweat.
Time to eat!
Delicious!
And that one!
And this one!
I'm in pain now...
We should have slowed down after the first plate.
I've got heartburn.
Peek.
But we have to pay extra if we leave leftovers.
That's bad!
It hurts...
I-I can't do it...
We're almost out of time.
Oh, Kagami!
She's on her second wind!
It'd be a waste otherwise!
Impossible.
No! No!
If you drink too much water...
...you won't be able to eat any more!
Just stuff down what you can...
...and wash it down with water at the very end!
Don't sit there looking impressed
Get to eating!
I can't eat another bite...
You can handle pudding or Bavarian cream!
Here.
Can't you eat it?
I'm stuffed, too!
I'm out, man...
You can just pour the pudding down your throat!
Hurry it up!
This isn't fun...
I can't have fun like this!
C'mon! Get with it!
Tests are over...
...so I did some hardcore gaming...
...which is why I'm so sleepy...
If you studied that hard...
...your tests would have gone differently.
Recent dating sims have a bunch of save points...
...but I can never find a good place to stop.
I'm the type to do it all in one sitting.
I've been wondering...
A student shouldn't be able to buy those.
How do you buy them?
I get my dad to buy them for me.
No way!
This happens a lot...
But your family still continues to amaze me!
You actually go buy them, Pops?
Plus, as a daughter, you shouldn't even be asking!
So I'm really sleepy.
You probably don't play games, Miyuki-san.
I don't have a game console...
...but I have a computer, so I occasionally play some games.
What do you play?
Didn't expect this!
Games like Solitaire and Minesweeper.
It can get pretty intense.
They're games...
...but you've got it wrong, Miyuki-san.
But I know what you mean.
It's actually easy to get absorbed...
...in those kinds of simple games.
What kind of scores do you get, Yuki-chan?
Luck is a factor in Solitaire...
...but I often score over ten thousand.
As for Minesweeper, I completed expert in
under one hundred seconds the other day.
These kind of people really get into this kind of stuff...
There was a lot of sports stuff this year.
That one athlete got gold
in figure skating at the Winter Olympics.
And there was quite a fuss over high school baseball.
So many games were going into extra innings!
Yup, that Handkerchief Prince.
Speaking of baseball...
That one player went to America, right?
Is the Japan Series already over?
A long time ago.
No way!
Were there any bargain sales?
This year's Japan Series was between that team and that team...
...so there weren't any supermarket
or department store chains involved.
But they had a commemorative sale.
But it was probably just a sale on ham.
Did they do that...?
Anyway, I need to remember to do a check next year...
Knowing you...
...you're probably just gonna buy snacks.
I'm not.
I need stuff like salt, sugar, and soy sauce.
Those kinds of household staples.
Well...
Kagami wouldn't understand what I'm talking about, right?
So sorry!
So I suck at household chores!
Eyedrops?
Want me to help?
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Lie down.
Yes.
Okay...
Relax.
Y-Yes.
Then here I go.
Okay.
Relax your muscles.
Yes.
Um...
I'm sorry.
I'm not doing this on purpose...
Your face...
...scares me!
With mail-in prize contests...
...the problem is how it takes forever to receive the item.
That's why I came up with a way to
fully enjoy these sweepstakes, Kagamin.
What's that?
First, you enjoy the game like you're at a festival.
Then once the item arrives, you can be happy again,
since you've completely forgotten about it.
Two for the price of one.
The waiting's what I can't stand...
You're infinitely positive about the stuff you enjoy, huh?
Good lucky!
Yes!
I hope to have a cheerful Lucky Channel today!
We're already on our ninth episode today!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
And here's the person that the producer, Itou-san...
...is going to say "Hey, Shiraishi. Come here a sec." to...
Really?!
I'm Akira-sama's assistant...
100% charged with energy...
Minoru Shiraishi.
It's a pleasure.
Okay.
Today's the third character introduction.
Tsukasa Hiiragi's turn!
Prop time!
Roll...
Are you supposed to be a clumsy, slow turtle?
Tsu-
Thi-
I'm sorry.
This is finally getting exciting!
Yes!
Time to pull up our loincloths...
...and do our best!
Right, Akira-sama?
Loincloths?
I'm supposed to be an idol...
...so that stuff's kinda...
You handle it.
That's right...
Uh...
When you pull a loincloth up so tight that it gets pinched...
Hey.
I'd like to warn you out of concern.
C-Concern...?
Once an entertainer gets in the gutter...
...it's over.
So I'm an entertainer...
Also...
You've been using other people's material a lot lately...
...so watch yourself.
Yes!
Um...
What are we doing today?
Introducing Tsukasa Hiiragi-san.
That To Hea-
Mi-Mi-Miracle!
Kamigishi...
Minorun-run!
Right?
You can say that?
What do you think?
She reminds me of one of those old idol characters.
Uh, you think so?
Well, I guess you could say she gives off some idol vibes...
Don't make me laugh!
Tsukasa Hiiragi's an idol?
Where did that come from?
Y'know...
You're working with me here.
Learn what a true idol is about already.
Y-Yes, ma'am.
Tsukasa Hiiragi is merely a soothing character...
...with a loser's face.
A loser's face, huh...
Anyway...
...who gives a damn about Tsukasa?
Not even Pops ever hit me!
I'll teach you the basics of an idol right now.
First is the method for having pictures taken.
Now look here.
This will be a useful lesson for you.
So put some back into it.
Yes!
You know how people suddenly
take pictures when you're in the city?
Come on.
Press the shutter.
Fawn. Fawn. Fawn.
Looking like a loser...?
Yeah.
Like that.
Props are also important.
You should always carry them around.
How?
And you won't want to be caught off
guard when you're walking around...
...so always be attentive.
And...
...make sure you have sparkling white teeth.
Like a doll!
Intense.
And then...
...make sure your eyes are all wide like goggles...
...and only smile with these muscles.
Jeepers!
And you want a natural expression.
Like if someone suddenly turns a camera on you...
Akira's, like, whoa!
Like that.
Natural, you say...
Also, as a variation...
...if you're going with a guy into a ho—
Oh, no!
It's time to say goodbye!
So send us any questions
or comments about the show, please!
You can also send us messages
about the radio show on our home page!
Okay!
Then look forward to next week.
Bye-bii!
We had a photo shoot, right?
Yes, we did.
The one where I was in the cardigan.
How was it?
That was cute...
Shankya!
It was cute?
What's wrong?
Yeah, well...
Everyone said it looked cute.
Guess so.
Yep.
You were on a roll.
Sure was.
Looked fun.
The upturned eyes...
...with the uh...
...arms crossed below my face...
...was really fun!
Yes.
Are you hooked now?
Including the cross-dressing, yes.
I'm hooked.
Did you check the pictures?
No, I didn't.
The manager...
Yes.
...checked the pictures...
Yes.
...and said there were some questionable ones to be honest.
Well, I had a bunch of stiffy shots...
...so those are probably gone.
Sorry! Sorry!
Made a little mistake.
I'll actually sing the next one.
And she's already ordering another song.
Let me have the remote for once.
Okay.
Have you guys decided, Tsukasa?
It'll be a little longer.
I don't listen to music much, so I don't know many songs.
That's okay.
I'll sing in the meantime.
Hey.
Don't just sing anime songs.
This isn't an anime song.
I've heard this before.
What is this?
It's KyonKyon.
I used to sing this with my dad a lot.
So you've gone from anime songs to oldies.
That's an insult to KyonKyon!
We met amidst the wind.
Tsukasa.
Ever since the day we fell in love...
Why don't you just choose a simple song?
Like a children's song.
...this clueless heart of mine...
I'm looking through that section, too...
I'm sorry.
...has longed for you.
There's no rush.
We still have plenty of time.
Don't cry, tender heart.
As long as wishes come true...
I want to cross that river of tears...
...and forget it all.
You never notice...
...as I secretly yearn for you.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Konata.
In world 3-1 of Super (bleep) Brothers...
...there's a staircase near the end of the level...
...where you can jump on the falling turtle...
If you repeatedly hit the A button...
...to jump on the turtle...
...you can get infinite lives...
...which is great...
...but if you overdo it...
...and go over 129 lives...
...dying once leads to a game over.
I won't bother going, "So you can't have infinite lives!"
Maybe it's that.
A public service announcement from
the folks near Kamitobaguchi Station...
...that you're supposed to do things in moderation.
Next time:
「Aspiration」
Aspiration.
Look forward to next time!
They bought me another cell phone!
Don't put it in the wash this time.
I'll put it somewhere obvious.
Hey!
Give me a hand, Tsukasa.
Coming!
Aspiration
Ba.
L.
Sa.
Mi.
C.
Huh?
There it is.
Vinegar.
Too much!
I'll input it for you, so hand it over!
That's irritating!
I-It's okay.
Don't worry.
I can do it myself.
I'm here to play!
Cousin Yui.
Welcome!
Whatcha doing?
Playing a dating sim that just came out.
Then I'm gonna borrow some random manga.
'Kay.
This game is age restricted...
...but did she not notice...
...or is she letting it slide?
Which one is it, officer?
And so...
...we beef things up during Traffic Safety Awareness Week.
Like detailed checks...
...and explanations of traffic laws...
It's pretty rough.
And sometimes, they start yelling at you.
But when I look at how she usually acts...
Scary! Scary!
...she's not very convincing when talking about laws or safety!
I'm totally shocked!
I've heard that colds are lasting longer this year...
...so I need to get better quickly.
Based on my number...
...I'll probably be here a while.
I'll read while I wait.
Mr. Ando.
Mr. Shigeo Ando.
Ms. Takara.
Ms. Miyuki Takara.
Ms. Miyuki Takara.
Are you here?
Then the next person.
Ms. Mariko Nishiyama.
Huh?!
What?!
Did they call me?!
What time is it?!
I need to pay more attention to my surroundings.
We will soon arrive at the final stop, Kamata.
Where am I?!
So I taught Tsukasa how to text message the other day.
She still had no idea after all that messing around.
Yay!
Yay!
And she must have been really happy about it...
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
...since she's constantly texting me.
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Must suck for the recipient.
Well, there's nothing to worry about.
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
She's the type to start off excited...
...and eventually lose interest.
Some people are just childish like that.
She sent another one.
If she doesn't get bored, you'll be pretty swamped.
And does she even have that much to talk about?
We're practically together 24/7.
And she apparently learned how to use symbols.
Look.
How about we buy soy cream-man on the way home again today?
What's all the stuff at the end?
You can tell she's having fun...
I haven't even seen half of these before.
I guess she's finally gotten the hang of it.
Yeah. But I prefer the one with an afro
Yeah. But I prefer the one with an afro
Really? But they probably aren't
actually performing
Yeah, might be
I see
Heh
Hey.
I know how you feel...
...but could you stop spamming family members?
Do you have a minute?
What?
I'm not sure about how to use text messaging on a cell phone.
Hey, hey, hey!
It's really easy, Dad.
You're so hopeless.
I'll teach you.
So I guess some people get all
snobby after they've learned something.
Um...
That smell is beyond words.
Right?
It just stinks too much.
Seriously.
You've got a lot of stuff saved on here.
Hey!
Stop going through that!
You've got messages that shouldn't be seen?
Not really.
No reason.
It's a boy.
Definitely a boy.
It's not!
She's not picking up.
Guess I'll call her house.
Hello, Kagami?
Konata?
You should answer your cell.
Well...
It didn't ring so I didn't notice.
Honestly...
Doesn't that defeat the purpose?
And where is that thing anyway?
Your cell phone really serves no purpose, huh?
Anyway...
About next weekend...
Someone's talking to me.
Hold on.
Hey!
Hurry it up!
Wait a bit!
You've been on the phone too long!
Can't wait any longer!
Sorry. Sorry.
I got in trouble for being on the phone too long.
Sorry.
But I figured you guys would be relaxed about that stuff.
Sounds like it's pretty strict.
Nah...
We were in the middle of a fighting game.
Tell me that earlier!
In this place...
...my point cards shine with an invisible magic.
You end up making unplanned purchases, yeah?
You really wing everything.
Though I kinda understand.
She's here.
In this city, we have Ani**te and Ga**rs...
Two anime stores...
There exists a person who
buys the same thing from both stores...
Legendary Girl...
A!
Legendary Girl A shift!
Welcome!
The DVD for Haruhi Vol. 5's in stock!
Limited edition!
Regular edition!
All ready!
And we've got loads of related items!
That's right...
Just display every item we have in stock.
She'll buy whatever she can.
I wanted a limited Aquarian Age bookmark today.
Need to go to Gamers.
No good!
Then we'll do a sleepover this weekend and play all night.
We usually do stuff at our place...
...but can we go to your house?
I'd like to go over every now and then.
It's not that you can't...
...but my dad's usually home because of work.
Oh.
So that just increases the burden on me.
What burden?
I'm kinda looking forward to seeing what Konata's house is like.
Yo.
Welcome.
Sorry to impose.
Thanks for having us today.
Welcome.
I've heard a lot about you two.
You're shrine maidens who live at a temple, right?
What have you been telling him?!
So do you usually wear yellow hakamas?
And like, that's the first thing he has to say?
We're here.
This is Kona-chan's room!
Crazy as expected.
This is cute!
This door...
Probably hides a stash of stuff you don't want seen.
A door that must never be opened.
Nah.
I share most of that stuff with Dad...
...so he handles storage.
You share...
Oh, yeah.
Your dad's an author, right?
Then have you ever gotten hooked on a
light novel or dating sim your dad wrote?
Nah.
He doesn't write any of that stuff.
Really...
Didn't expect that...
But...
He likes that kind of stuff...
...so wouldn't he want to write them?
He's like a lurker...
According to him...
...he plays dating sims and life sims on his own time...
...so he doesn't feel the need to bring it to the workplace.
I've been at a loss for words for a while now.
Guess that's the Izumi family for you.
My dad was being all clingy the other day.
So I tried saying, "You're annoying, Dad!"
That's a little harsh, you know.
Then he's like...
Couldn't you at least say, "I hate you, Dad!" or something?
No.
That's not quite right either.
But your way of thinking wouldn't fulfill his expectations.
Yeah.
No idea what you're talking about.
Let's take a break.
This is it!
Even TV shows are starting to look like 2ch.
I guess.
Not that I would know.
Oh, yeah.
For someone hardcore, you don't use much of that lingo.
In normal situations.
In chatrooms, I'm like this.
Wow...
Is this even Japanese?
If you can read this, you've lost.
Is there anything I can help with?
Then serve the salad.
Let's eat!
It's great!
Sure is.
A job well done.
This is nothing for someone who does housework on a daily basis.
If you did more housework, you might get better.
Mind your own business.
Look, Konata.
It's perfect.
It's a scene out of my dreams!
A man eating a meal with three high school girls...
H-Heaven on earth...
Sakura...
...happens way more than it should in dating sims.
Tohsaka... Tohsaka's your sister!
Really now...
It gets chilly when it's late.
Should have put on a jacket.
A shooting star!
I couldn't make my wish three times.
It's pretty hard when they come out of nowhere.
But I'll pull it off one day and have my wish granted.
Tsukasa's a dreamer...
But it's impossible from a practical standpoint.
It's a superstition because you know it isn't going to work.
Why does this one have no dreams...?
Want a drink?
Thanks.
You switched hairstyles.
For fun.
While we were taking a bath.
Why do the same parts feel so different on different people?
A photo album.
Can I take a look?
Sure.
Kona-chan's so cute!
You haven't changed much.
And like...
...you sure are close with your dad.
That's my mom.
No way!
So young!
Don't I look like her?
She was legal, right?
I always wonder when I look at Dad.
What did Mom ever see in Dad?
Hey, now...
You look just like your mom, you know...
Then in that case...
What would be your type?
Mine?
When you put it that way, I don't really have one...
Really?
Spill it.
Which means Mom was okay with anyone.
And she said something about knowing Dad since they were little.
Well, that's a little...
Couldn't let Dad flounder around by himself.
You don't even hold back for your parents, huh?
But when I look at my mom...
In manga and games these days...
...a lot of middle schoolers look mature...
...and a lot of adults look really young.
What is this?
Do you want me to say something?
I wish Yuki-chan could have come.
Well, she's busy.
That's it!
I'll text her so she isn't lonely.
Miyuki's really considerate, so stop that.
I got a reply.
I'm glad you're having fun.
I'm working hard to finish my homework right now.
Please invite me again next time.
I forgot we had homework!
Do something, Kagami!
Our class didn't have any.
Can I go to sleep?
Wait!
That shooting star.
It might work if I use short wishes.
Uh, you think?
What are you doing?
Studying how to say wishes faster.
Stop escaping reality and get your homework done.
Hey, Yuki-chan.
I didn't get this part in class earlier.
That part?
Konata leads to Kona-chan.
Miyuki leads to Yuki-chan.
Then what nickname would you use for Kagami?
Kaga-chan?
Gami-chan?
Kagami means mirror.
Kyo also means mirror.
[
]
Maybe Kyo-chan.
Pronounce Kagami a different way.
Kyo.
Good naming sense.
Kyo also means strong.
It feels strong like her, too.
Kyo also means evil.
And you could use this Kyo-chan, too
Th-That wasn't my intention...
We probably shouldn't tell Sis.
Then what nickname would you give yourself?
Tsuka-chan?
Kasa-chan?
Hi-chan, I guess.
It's harder with my first name.
I see.
You do give off a "hi-hi" image all the time.
That wasn't my intention...
Okay.
Then I'll start calling you Hi-chan.
What?
Huh? Huh?
But it feels kind of weird...
...if I chose it myself...
And what about that?
That?
Doesn't matter.
Want revenge, Sebastian?
Name's Shiraishi.
Hey!
Kyo-chan!
Kyo-chan!
Is she calling me?
It's too hard to understand, so stop that.
Then how do you want me to call you?
Doesn't Kagami work?
A nickname would be better.
Like Kona-chan or Yuki-chan...
Then call me Kagami the Great.
Hey!
Kagami the Great!
She really did it!
What is it?
Just trying it out.
Sorry for the wait, Kagami the Great.
What's wrong, Kagami the Great?
Whoa...
My bad...
Please...
Just call me normally.
Good lucky!
Okay!
We're already on the booming tenth episode of Lucky Channel!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami.
Hello!
I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi!
And right off the bat...
...we have our fourth character introduction...
Kagami Hiiragi!
She serves as a punch line character in the show.
But isn't she just a tsundere?
What an obvious setup.
I beg to differ.
The classification of Kagami Hiiragi as a tsundere is a bit hasty.
Then what?
First, do we comprehend the true
meaning of the qualities of a tsundere?
No, unfortunately...
...the word tsundere has suffered misuse and decay...
...and one could say that the definition has evolved.
To begin with, the word tsundere was born in the year 2002...
...an Internet term...
...but the original definition was...
...a character who starts off hostile...
...and eventually becomes affectionate.
Yes!
In other words...
...it was supposed to describe a change over time!
Do you really understand?
And now...
...it is used to describe the multiple faces of a character.
In other words...
...hostile on the outside...
...and affectionate on the inside...
...would be how the word is currently understood.
I declare here!
This is plainly a mistake!
We must bring back the true meaning of tsundere...
...and restore this depraved nation!
Rise up, citizens!
Not bad, Sebastian.
Who's that?
So if Kagami's not a tsundere, what is she?
You meant me?
I don't really get this complicated stuff...
...but if you insist...
...do you have a replacement for
what's currently known as tsundere?
Uh...
It's not that I don't...
Maybe cool-dere...
No, that's wrong.
Deretsun?
You got no sense at all.
Tsundere's fine.
No, that's...
That's wrong!
That's it!
Let's ask the viewers to come up with a new expression!
Good idea!
Delegating, huh?
So, everyone in front of the TV!
Yes, you!
Try to come up with a new word
to describe characters like Kagami!
And rewrite the modern lexicon!
Dubbed the Complete Tsundere Debate!
You can find more details on the radio show and home page!
We're waiting for your passionate ideas!
This is the end.
Oh, well.
Lots and lots...
Lots and lots...
Bye-bee.
Bye-bee!
Fast forward!
Whoa, I talked a lot today.
The most ever, yeah?
Huh?
Akira-sama?
Wh-What's wrong?
Satisfied?
Yes! Uh...
This is the most I've ever spoken.
I think I did a fair job.
I'm going to dinner with the
executive and producer from your studio.
Uh...
We're gonna discuss your future.
Uh, h-hold on a sec.
What do you mean?
No point in telling you about how your future's looking.
No, no, no, no, no!
And aren't you still working at CoCo*chi?
That's only during the day.
And it doesn't pay much.
And the grill place?
I'm still doing that.
Or that doesn't even matter!
That's intruding into my privacy, so stop!
I'm next.
Tsukasa.
How about this one?
This works!
Right, Yuki-chan?
I know this.
Then sing it.
Thanks, Kona-chan.
Thank you very much.
No problem.
They chose a song?
Lonely.
Your battered figure is reflected in the window.
This song was popular when we were in preschool, right?
Don't really know.
I walked aimlessly...
I'm sorry.
Neither do I.
I remember.
Sighed inwardly...
Our older sisters sang it a lot.
Songs sung by parents and older siblings...
I'm proud.
...while from an earlier generation...
I've always been searching for something...
...tend to be memorable.
...to bind this fragile, ephemeral passion.
Why can I no longer dream innocently as I once did?
There is no place for me in this city.
Love spills from my body.
Caved, huh?
Can't be helped.
It's really high.
The crowd—
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Kagami.
When you go out to eat...
...and order something with liquids...
...and a few drops splatter onto your clothes...
...it's pretty depressing.
And it really sucks if it's curry sauce.
And you happen to be wearing your favorite clothes.
Leaves you down the whole day!
And when you buy a box lunch
with sauce from a convenience store...
...and you carry it level so the contents don't spill...
...but once you open the bag...
...you discover that it spilled inside and everything's a mess.
Makes you lose your appetite.
And when you ask them to bag
hot and cold items separately...
...and they bag the cold drinks with your magazines...
...and the paper sucks up the condensation...
...and the magazine's all soggy...
...and you're like what was the
point in bagging them separately then?!
Next time:
「The Many Ways to
Spend Christmas Eve」
The Many Ways to Spend Christmas Eve.
Look forward to next time!
We saw a shooting star the other day...
...but Kagami said something about the
wishing three times thing being unrealistic.
Shooting stars are so wonderful.
I haven't seen many of them.
It's difficult to see the stars from our house.
Right...
Since your house is in the city, right?
I would probably be too amazed...
...to have time to make a wish.
The sight of a dazzling, shining star...
...would fill you with feelings of joy.
That could explain the myth that shooting stars grant wishes.
Your honesty is what dazzles me.
The Many
Ways
to Spend
Christmas
Eve
It's almost winter break.
But we have finals first.
Do you have any plans for winter break?
Nothing.
Reminds me...
We haven't taken a vacation in a while.
I went to Asakusa the other day.
When was that?
You know how you get sleepy on the train during winter?
She missed her stop?!
Huh?
But isn't that the opposite direction?
The train reached the end of the line and turned around...
...and then I missed my stop again...
By the time I came to, we were in Asakusa.
Hey now.
You can only miss your stop so many times.
But it wasn't entirely a bad thing.
Since I hadn't visited Asakusa in a while.
Shouldn't be doing that right before finals.
And I had a feeling I saw a girl in a
sailor uniform with a machine gun walk by...
What was that about?
Don't tell me someone was making a hit.
And you know...
Sleeping more helps you grow more!
You're growing?
I got an even better one.
My dad pulled an all-nighter and then went to turn in a manuscript.
He got on an early-morning train but missed his stop...
...then it reached the end and made a U-turn...
...and when he woke up, he'd already missed his stop...
...and this happened a few more times.
He started to wake up when he got close to his station...
Patrasche...
...but he still ended up missing it.
I'm so tired...
He was tired and wanted to get
home and sleep, but he couldn't get home.
In the end, he no longer knew...
...which direction he was going whenever he woke up.
Unbelievable...
I still wake up before my stop when I fall asleep.
That's amazing!
How do you know?
Maybe she has an internal alarm clock.
Though it doesn't work all the time.
What was that?
Since she's always snacking away.
Shut up!
But train seats are really warm...
...so you get really sleepy.
That's true.
It's all warm and fuzzy...
...like you're sitting next to the window in the classroom...
...on a sunny winter afternoon.
What's this?
Covering for each other?
I-It's not like that!
The other day...
When I tried to wake you up on the ride home...
Hey, wake up!
We're there.
Just five more minutes...
I mean it...
She yelled out half-asleep.
Everyone around us was laughing.
One of my friends did that in class once.
Sheesh.
You two are so similar.
You're grouping us together?!
But why five minutes?
Well, if you went to wake someone up
and they were like, give me another hour...
...wouldn't you be pissed?
Well, that's true...
...but five minutes comes up in a lot of other situations.
Like, just wait five minutes!
You have a point.
Maybe 'cause it isn't too long or too short?
Though the five-minute wait for a train feels really long.
Sure does!
Guess so.
But then again...
People who say to wait five minutes...
...tend to make you wait a lot longer.
You know how people say to not use
your cell or put on makeup on the train?
But it's a lot worse when the person next to you leans on you.
They're so heavy.
And you end up wanting to stand after managing to get a seat.
And when you're stuck with the sticky head of an old person...
Sometimes, I try to shove them off...
...but they somehow manage to
keep returning to the same position.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a mystery.
When I fall asleep...
...and there's a man on one side and an empty seat on the other...
...I try to lean myself towards the empty seat...
...but for some reason, I always end up leaning the other way.
Guess your body feels more comfortable leaning a certain way.
When I see someone leaning over...
...I shrink up like this...
...then their elbow hits my side.
Doesn't that mean they're actually awake?
Really?
Well...
Bye-bee!
Goodbye.
You know how...
...some people at our school take the inbound train home...
...and some people take the outbound train home?
Don't the ones who take the
inbound train look more refined somehow?
Since Yuki-chan's an inbounder.
That's not...
Yeah, yeah.
Back to the farm, fellas.
Oh.
This is the stop before.
Yo!
I didn't get any studying done yesterday.
I actually put in a lot of effort this time.
If I do say so myself.
How much studying did you do?
Only four hours.
A whole four hours!
Huh?
You're good at everything, Kagami.
Well, I do a lot of studying.
Just between you and me.
You're definitely really competitive.
Well...
Maybe it's my pride as the older sister...
I feel like I have to be ahead of Tsukasa.
Though I usually say neither of us is really older or younger.
I used to be pretty worried about that stuff.
But Tsukasa probably wasn't much competition.
Well, that's true...
She's just like Kona-chan!
It's almost Christmas!
I wonder what my present will be this year.
You still get presents...
How long did you believe in Santa Claus?
Santa Claus isn't real?
What...?
Santa never came to Konata's house...
...so her dad gave her presents in his stead.
That's why she thought he might be out there.
That old man...
He really wants to look good in front of his daughter, huh?
Hey, Hiiragi!
Hiiragi-san.
Here's the handout from before.
Gotcha.
And then, Hiiragi-chan...
Hiiragi!
You dropped your pencil.
Thanks.
Hey, Kagami!
Kagami-san.
Here's the handout from earlier.
Got it.
Sebastian, like, stinks.
Kagami.
You dropped your handkerchief.
Oh my.
Maybe I go to Tsukasa's class a little too much.
My cavity started hurting recently.
My, how dreadful.
I really can't stand dentists.
You went to see the dentist for your cavity the other day.
Is it better now?
Dentists take a long time on each tooth...
...and they have to repeat the procedure for every tooth...
...so it takes a long time, right?
So I ended up escaping...
...after making a number of excuses.
What to do?
Even though she sounded all cute...
...that's actually pretty crazy!
Konata!
Wanna go wild with everyone on Christmas?
Sorry.
I already have plans for Christmas.
Oh.
Is it a man?
Something like that.
Are you going somewhere with your dad?
Nope.
I told Dad that I'd be home late.
Don't tell me...
You're really going on a date with your boyfriend?
When did you...
Sorry to disappoint you...
...but I'm just working.
Oh...
Almost all the customers are male, so I wasn't lying.
Thought you'd managed to get ahead of us.
You got me.
There's a special event on Christmas.
We dress like Santa CIaus for that.
You really love that kind of stuff, huh?
But you know...
You guys also cosplay as shrine maidens for New Year's.
At your temple.
Don't call it cosplay.
Anyway...
It's good that Santa Claus gives everyone presents...
...but ever since I was little, I was like, he's totally trespassing.
You shouldn't look down on something based on a holy man.
Spiteful brat.
Still...
Santa is supposed to give children dreams...
...so what's with the men who turn
to this little kid with their dreams?
What's this?
You just casually insulted a lot of people...
And is it okay for you guys to celebrate Christmas?
Oh, yeah.
We usually got Christmas presents, right?
We worship every god there is.
We regularly visit temples.
And we sang in a church choir once.
Sounds peaceful.
But...
Yes?
A shrine maiden said she wanted
to get married in a wedding dress...
Is that okay?
Wouldn't that be a little complicated?
Yo!
Getting chilly these days.
Cousin Yui, welcome!
Whatcha watching?
A detective show.
Any good?
Not really.
Nothing else to do.
Okay, I got it.
That man's the killer.
Please wait, Officer.
There's something odd about this case.
Nothing odd at all.
Case closed!
What's with you?
This has nothing to do with you.
This is why cops are useless.
Aren't you a cop yourself...?
Why'd someone have to call now?
They're about to reveal the killer.
How can you tell?
Look.
I see.
You're the killer, huh?
No use in hiding it now.
I wonder why these two-hour
shows always end on the edge of a cliff.
Maybe cause people aren't willing to
act until their back's against the wall?
Yahoo!
How ya doing?
Cousin Yui, evenin'.
Whatcha watchin'?
A movie for a popular detective show.
Dad rented it.
Crimes don't happen in conference rooms!
They happen at the scene!
No, no, that's wrong.
Nobody ever gets that passionate.
You're going to deny this too?
Pretty sure that...
...the receipts were stolen at the behest of the chief.
This is why he fails.
You know what's going on?
That's right...
They eat pork bowls a lot in police shows...
...but apparently, that isn't actually allowed.
Well, it's fiction...
...so a lot of it's probably made-up.
So police commissioners' granddaughters aren't really like that?!
Police commissioners' granddaughters?
Well, I've never met one.
I'd at least want Mai-chan to exist...
To give me hope...
Empty dream.
There sure are a lot of cases with adults going after children.
Indeed...
I've been thinking...
If you taught kids martial arts...
...wouldn't there be a decrease in that stuff?
After intensive training...
...Master Oyama was able to beat a
cow with his bare hands, with one blow.
And bears toppled like trees after a couple of hits!
I see.
But won't that come back to haunt you?
When those kids grow up...
...the adults will be strong, too.
U-Um...
You know...
People say training in the martial arts...
...helps you mature as a person.
I see.
But...
There's someone who does martial
arts and hasn't matured right here.
How rude!
Oh.
I have this cousin, Cousin Yui's little
sister, who's entering high school next year.
She's physically weak...
Cousin Konata!
...but she's sweet and pure and really adorable.
But when I start thinking about how a
healthy spirit leads to a healthy body...
....I start feeling like something dark
is lurking behind those shining eyes.
I doubt aphorisms are universal.
Look at you.
The year's almost over.
Once it's December, you always feel like the year flew by so fast.
Are you going to help out at your
temple as shrine maidens again this year?
Probably.
Come draw your fortune again.
With fortunes...
If you get really bad luck, it's an unpleasant feeling.
But if you get really good luck...
...it feels like you already wasted
your luck for the year, doesn't it?
Well, that's why people say average luck is best.
Okay!
Then here's an early present from your teacher!
Here are your report cards!
How did you do, Kona-chan?
Here! Good work!
Teacher!
I don't want this present!
We give presents based on effort in my school of Santa.
Think on it.
Like a bonus to your winter homework.
I wonder what kind of Christmas cakes will be good this year!
When you go to a bakery...
...there are so many cute cakes...
...that you can have fun just looking.
What happens to the cakes that aren't sold before Christmas?
Perhaps the employees take them home.
But if nobody takes them, they might throw them away.
They often compare marriage to Christmas.
Like how twenty-five is the end of the line.
Once you're past twenty-five,
a Christmas cake is just another cake.
After one night, it's just another decorated cake...
...that suddenly looks stale...
...so you lose your appetite.
I was talking about Santa Claus with Kona-chan the other day.
How long did you believe in Santa, Yuki-chan?
It feels like you would have been a true believer like me.
I also believed in Santa Claus.
When I was little, I tried to send a
letter of gratitude to Santa Claus...
...and did some research.
But I didn't learn much after asking my parents...
...so I did some thorough investigating...
...and learned of the people Santa Claus was based on...
...and once I saw the phrase "origin of Santa Claus" pop up...
...my dreams were quickly shattered.
How'd you do, Miyuki-san?
Lemme see!
Just what you would expect from Yuki-chan.
I could never do so well.
I feel a little pissed about losing...
Yuki-chan's at the top of our class, so it's hopeless...
We could never beat her.
No.
I don't care about grades...
...but stuff like bust size...
Look! Whoa!
I'm hungry.
I'll have a cup of ramen.
Not done yet?
These three minutes of waiting feel really long.
I'll use this to kill time today.
And then your noodles end up soggy, right?
Me too!
The extra broth for my cup fried soba dried up!
You people...
She told me she would be late...
But this is too late!
I can't let her make a habit of this.
Need to give her a stern dressing down every now and then.
As the man of the house.
I'm home!
Konata!
Come here for a minute!
What time do you think it i—
Merry Christmas!
This is my Christmas present for you.
It must have been cold outside!
Want some hot tea?
Yay!
I do! I do!
I'm so happy I could die.
Yo!
G'day!
Cousin Yui's here to save the day!
You stink of alcohol!
It's dangerous to DUI!
I parked the car somewhere and had a drink nearby.
Listen to me!
It's Christmas Eve yet my husband's not here!
Our plans tonight are...
Cousin Yui...
Shouldn't you go to your parents'
place instead every once in a while?
Hello?
Yui?
It's me.
I was going to sneak in and surprise you...
...but it was locked.
Are you at your parents' place?
I'm coming home!
Right away at full speed!
Running every light on the way!
Seriously, you shouldn't be breaking the law.
I'll drive you.
I've got a little time.
I'll log in for a sec.
Huh?
Teacher's on.
Teacher.
Let's go crazy.
Until morning.
Please wait one moment.
It's not a leftover.
Doesn't count as a leftover.
Nanako Kuroi
'Cause I bought one.
27 years old
Single
I was here last Sunday to buy manga.
Don't get why you pay the fare to come here so much.
Even if it's for the points...
...this is pretty excessive.
You really love this stuff.
Besides, do you even use the prizes they give?
I don't.
Thought so.
That kind of stuff is hard to use.
Yep. Yep.
lt'd be a waste to use.
Their value would go down.
Oh, so that's how it is...
Whatever.
No!
Yes.
Didn't you get shocked by static electricity?
Nope.
Why's that?
Konata's always sitting in front of the computer...
...so her body's already full of weird waves?
Still, I really can't stand winter for that reason.
And I heard you can get shocked just by touching someone's hand.
Ow!
Maybe this means you two don't really get along with each other.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Oh my.
Ow!
Whatcha doing?
Oh, I wanted to try it again!
Stronger!
Good lucky!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
We're already on the eleventh episode of Lucky Channel!
And on this eleventh episode...
...I have some wonderful news you've all been waiting for!
U-Uh...
Everybody's sent in...
She's really in it today.
...lots of passionate letters...
...asking for Akira to show up in the actual show!
H-Hello.
On the next episode, I, Akira Kogami...
I'm the assistant Minoru Shiraishi.
Zip it!
...will be showing up in the actual show!
But I need to introduce myself!
Thank you to Konata Izumi from
Saitama along with everyone else...
...who sent postcards to Newtype!
So Akira-sama's also making an appearance?
What's with the...
"Like, you're finally showing up in the twelfth episode?
I've been in it for, like, forever!
Ho. Ho. Ho."
...attitude you've got?
A-Absolutely not!
It's an honor to appear with Akira-sama in the actual show as well!
Appear?
All you did this week was pick up a handkerchief, yeah?
You shouldn't be thinking you've got
what it takes to make it in this business!
Don't forget that you can just disappear like that!
I-I'll keep that in mind.
After that announcement...
...you can't wait for the next episode!
You want it now?
Everyone is probably trembling...
Er, shaking naked in their boots in anticipation!
Hey.
We should treat our fans with care...
...and air it right now!
We can grab a thirty minute slot, right?
Uh...
That'd be pushing it...
Pretty please?
Or forget it.
So send any messages you have to the radio show or the home page!
Bye-bee!
Bye-bee!
What to do?
It'd be bad if I overshadowed the main characters, right?
It would indeed.
But there's a tendency for the
main character's friends and rivals...
...to end up more popular than the actual main characters!
What?
A-Akira-sama?
What's wrong?
Aren't you...
Yes?
...talking about yourself?
Don't get so full of yourself 'cause you're popular lately!
No, absolutely not!
Don't expect this to last!
No, never!
You won't be placing first in the poll!
What are you talking about?!
Don't mess with me!
That's impossible.
Listen to m—
Next, we have a duet from Tsukasa and Miyuki-san.
Yuki-chan.
Let's go up front to sing.
You chose a song for them to sing...
How bizarre.
I know all kinds of songs.
But it's still an anime song, huh?
Anime songs actually come in handy in these situations.
That would be so wonderful!
Really would be so wonderful!
This dream! That dream!
I have so many dreams!
Every single one of them...
...will come true!
The magical pocket makes them come true!
I want to fly freely through the sky!
Here!
Bamboo-copter!
Not even close!
An! An! An!
I love you so much!
Doraemon!
Homework, clean—
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Tsukasa.
Um...
I was really hungry one night...
...but it was really late...
...so I was wondering if I should eat something...
I finally decided a little bite would be okay.
And then I went to the kitchen...
...and I remembered I had some snacks left over...
...so I opened up the freezer...
I'm already out of time?!
Next time:
「Let's Go to the Festival」
Let's Go to the Festival.
Look forward to next time!

Miyuki-san!
Got any plans for the end of the year?
Izumi-san.
There's this festival, and I was wondering if you'd like to go...
A festival for the end of the year?
Sounds like fun.
It'll be lots of fun!
Is it something like a snow festival?
But I'm going to visit relatives...
Pretty sure that...
...I received a similar invitation back during summer.
Kagami-san.
I'll translate what Konata said.
She wants buddies to buy stuff for her at Comiket.
I was totally freaked out by the site when I went.
I'm not lying.
A festival's a festival.
It's all work and no fun by yourself.
Let's Go
to the
Festival
Dec
Heisei 18
Hello?
This is the Izumi residence.
Konata?
I'm writing New Year's cards right now.
Are you guys in mourning and refusing cards?
Didn't get a letter about it...
No.
Where did that come from?
Well, you know...
Weren't you absent one day this
year because of a death in the family?
Um...
But don't worry about that.
Don't tell me you used another trick out of manga?!
Shiny shine!
I'm in the middle of cleaning right now.
I see.
Then I won't keep you too long. I'll hang up now.
Bye!
I wonder why...
When there's something you don't
want to do, you suddenly want to clean...
...but once you start cleaning, it suddenly feels like a pain?
Konata.
Less resting, okay?
It's called Comiket?
FIRST-TIMER
I heard it was a big festival...
FIRST-TIMER
FIRST-TIMER
...but it sure starts early.
I'm so excited!
SECOND-TIMER
Looks like you haven't heard anything.
SECOND-TIMER

Poor thing.
REGULAR-VISITOR
Nah.
REGULAR-VISITOR
She'll get used to it soon enough.
REGULAR-VISITOR
Tsukasa...
Just so you know...
...this event is gonna exhaust you...
...in more than one way...
Will you be okay?
Then I'll do my best!
Do you really understand?
We're picking up more and more of her people...
Okay!
You'll soon be allowed to enter!
Sis...
This place is kinda scary...
Told you...
Regular Participants
Circle Members
Industry Members
That's right.
I should explain your assignments now.
Assignments?
Here you go.
These are your shopping lists.
Once we get inside, we'll split up and go
around the circles according to this map.
You two handle sections 1-3 in the east building.
I'll take 4-6.
But be careful.
If you don't follow the path marked in red...
...you might get stuck between rows of displays...
...and end up trapped.
And here and here...
If you're swept into the crowd there...
...you'll be stuck for over half an hour.
Why do we have to work so hard?
Just do it.
The ones marked with green can wait until afternoon.
They're stocked up...
...so there's almost no danger of them running out.
Just focus on the ones marked in red before noon.
S stands for something newly published.
K stands for something already in print.
If you don't know what's what, just buy everything.
Here's your ammo.
You're going to have to pay in cash.
The coffee will be your only refreshment for a while.
Take a drink every thirty minutes.
This will be our final rendezvous point.
1 PM on the dot.
I'll wait fifteen minutes...
...but if you don't show up...
...I'll go look for you in the medical office, so watch the clock.
That is all.
Any questions?
You only ever sound...
...intelligent and passionate when this kind of stuff is involved.
Please don't run!
Climax from the beginning!
The limit for new works is four copies per person.
Please cooperate.
Um...
Excuse me.
This is A-92, right?
Yes.
One of each new book?
That will be 1,000 yen.
Yes, what did you need?
Um...
Which of these are new...
Yes.
The new ones would be this and this.
Each one is 500 yen.
Good work!
Did you enjoy the snacks?
That's wonderful!
U-Um...
Three of each please.
Thank you for your business!
Dripping Brigade Chief...
...and Naughty Captain, correct?
Your total comes to 3,000 yen!
I'd like these.
Okay.
Your total is 4,500 yen.
Here.
Thank you very much!
Locked and loaded...
Onto the next point.
Um...
Is this the east building?
Then north should be this way...
Um...
Wa—
Excuse me!
I'm going that way!
I've pretty much covered all the big places.
Let's see...
The next place is...
Just a peek...
Gauron and Sousuke are...
This is...
Would you like that?
It'll be 500 yen.
Um...
Too intense for me!
She's here.
It's her.
Legendary Girl A!
Calm down.
She'll think we're weird if we panic.
But there's a weird jinx...
...where every circle suddenly becomes big after she buys a book!
It's impossible to stay calm!
I know!
That's why we put so much effort into this book!
So she would buy it!
You're right...
Even though it was the end of the year...
...we skipped work to do this!
This year will be our year!
Can I take a look?
Yes! Go ahead!
Uh...
What do you think?
We put a lot of work into the concert scene.
It's okay.
Thankssomuch.
Don't cry!
Next summer for sure!
Um...
Excuse me.
Yes?
What's the matter?
Where is Pu-61 located?
Pu?
Wasn't Pu in the east building?
Where is the east building?
This is the west building.
If you want to go to the east building...
...get in that line there...
...and go up one floor.
How long will it take?
Let's see...
At this time, probably an hour.
Please wait one moment
Okay, I'm done.
Sorry, Kona-chan.
I just now got back from the west building.
You get completely lost after getting caught up in the crowd...
...in this event...
I had to wait in line for an hour to use the restroom.
Well...
I figured it would be a rough schedule for a first-timer...
...so let's just stroll around for the afternoon.
You're not done yet?
But you know...
...it's gotten a lot better since they moved this to Ariake.
They only had two convenience stores near the site at Harumi.
Site at Harumi?
The last one at Harumi was twelve years ago, huh?
Wait.
How old were you?
Around five?
My dad took me.
We always stayed at this place called Hotel Urashima.
My first time was at the summer festival.
That was one crazy second floor.
The sweat from all the participants evaporated...
...and turned into these fluffy steam clouds.
Enough already.
Don't want to hear it.
Everything's gotten a lot easier after they moved this to Ariake...
...but maybe it's 'cause of the people mainly here for events...
...many of the younger participants think
of themselves as customers, sadly enough.
This was supposed to be an event put on by all of us.
Sorry to interrupt you while you're on a roll...
...but you've totally lost me.
I didn't come here during summer...
...but they also have places like these, huh?
There.
The main stuff is probably all sold out, though.
It's Nagato! Nagato!
The person behind Nagamon is here as a salesgirl!
Here.
Thank you very much.
What are you talking about?
How can you be out of Haruhi goods?!
Why did I bother coming here if the
Nagato phone cards are sold out?!
Please calm down!
He's horrible.
I can't do anything about it!
Like I just said.
Like I care!
There's been a spike in people like him.
I'm never coming back to this dump!
I'm terribly sorry, sir!
Unfortunately, our limited goods...
...have already sold out!
Really?!
Really.
Well, if you're gonna show up this late.
Figured as much.
I feel for you...
...but you gotta line up early...
Fool!
Asia...
Wh-What?!
Even customers who show up late...
...must be completely satisfied!
Have you lost the true spirit?
B-But...
All we have is leftover stuff now!
Leftover, you say?
Leftover items still have value!
A value that can't be found...
...in popular and typical moe items!
This Comiket exists to reveal their true value!
Now that all limited goods have been eliminated...
...the true battle has begun for industry booths!
B-By George...
Now!
Make a recommendation to the customer!
Dig up your true item!
Anything I can use as a weapon?
Ho—
How about this?!
No!
Gotta be this!
No, you see.
Nagato and everybody else are selling like hotcakes...
...yet look at this.
Even Koizumi's sells well.
Quiet!
This one's gone unsold for three years!
And the Captain's sold out instantly!
So please purchase this Kyon!
No, I recommend Sousuke!
No, I wanted CoCo Saikoubi-chan!
You...
...fools!
Y-You're...
President Takahashi!
Yes.
I am...
...Takahashi the President!
I overheard your conversation!
Your desire to promote a new perspecive of value is commendable!
That place is always pumped up.
R-Really?
However...
R-Really...
I cannot forgive your selfish desire to promote unpopular characters!
Well...
They're both main characters...
Sis, I'm sleepy.
I'm sleepy, too.
We had to help out at home as soon as we got back from Ariake...
Why do they have that event on New Year's Eve?
Kagami.
Tsukasa.
Happy New Year!
Kona-chan.
Happy New Year!
You have an awful lot of energy for
someone who was at that event since morning.
Plus, it's cold, so I figured you wouldn't bother.
Well, that's true...
...but January 1st is a new beginning...
...so I have to come charge up for the coming year.
That's admirable.
No, that's what Dad said.
Hello!
Suddenly, I'm disturbed.
Shrine maiden outfits are so invigorating!
This and that...
We're done praying.
Okay.
Good job.
Did you guys do any praying?
Oh, yeah...
You were doing some intense praying, Sis.
There you go blabbing again!
It wasn't that intense.
I-I was just hoping I could be in the
same class as you and Miyuki this year.
Sis...
What about Kona-chan?
You know...
Kagami's actually pretty cute.
Be quiet!
You making fun of everything is why I never want to tell you!
And then there's the way you resist...
Something wrong with that?!
Sis has always been the only one in a different class.
Maybe Ms. Kuroi hates me.
I'll also pray...
...to be in the same class...
...as Sis!
Tsukasa...
No way.
Kagami needs to be in a different class.
Wh-Why?
'Cause you know...
That way I can borrow stuff from you when I forget mine.
And I won't get caught if I copy your homework.
And if you're in our class, my rank will go down.
Then you go be in a different class by yourself.
The other...
The other day...
Sebastian was...
Female students are so wonderful...
Are you going to draw your fortune this year?
Might as well.
Since I'm here.
Bad
Very Good
Bad
Very Good
Bad
Bad
Bad
Bad
It's good to get an early start on the year.
Indeed.
And I got to see something nice.
This will be a good year.
Don't worry.
If you've already hit rock bottom...
...things can only get better.
Something good will happen.
What can I say...
It all depends on how you word it.
Thanks...
Want to tie a bad luck ward on the tree?
I'll do that.
So many!
Here, too!
Here's a spot!
So this is the power of bad luck...
Looks like it.
Whether or not something good will happen...
...depends on the amount of effort you spend.
Drawing your fortune is just a game of luck.
That's true...
Although a staff member shouldn't be saying that...
Maybe I should go for a whole set from very good to very bad.
Are they supposed to be trading cards?
Maybe you can draw a secret fortune.
What would a secret fortune be like?
Like ultra bad luck.
Why'd you go with something bad?
Nobody would want that.
You know...
Whoever collects all of them gets a special item!
No, there's no such thing.
Oh, yeah...
[kagami mochi: two stacked rice cakes; traditional New Year's decoration]
I just saw a huge kagami mochi...
This big!
Is that where your name came from?
Well, you're not totally wrong...
The round shape of a kagami mochi...
...is modeled after a mirror...
...but it's long been said that gods rest within mirrors...
...so the name is supposed to invoke the blessings of the gods.
And the round shape also signifies family happiness.
Her name has such a fantastic origin...
...yet she grew up to be an awfully pragmatic person!
Would you like one?
Okay.
There sure are a lot of worshippers.
Since it's New Year's.
Though we aren't that well-known.
I wonder how many of them are
here for the shrine maidens like Dad.
Here we go again!
There aren't that many!
Maybe...
Then once again...
Happy New Year!
Let's have another wonderful year.
Yeah.
Let's.
Hi!
Happy New Year!
How about it?
Look at this beautiful sight!
Isn't it great?
Isn't it fantastic?
Look at all the pretty flowers everywhere!
Dad.
Want some tea?
Sure.
Here.
Thanks.
Dad.
Want to play a game?
Dad.
[zoni soup: a broth eaten with rice cakes; New Year's meal]
Want some zoni soup?
Dad!
NEW YEAR'S
ALLOWANCE
Kinda like that.
Apparently, he likes how I keep scurrying over until I get my money.
I'm exhausted.
Well, yeah...
You guys are really close, huh?
And I managed to get my money...
...so I'm planning on going to Gamers right now.
Really...
The fact that all of those shops are in the city is a pain.
I'm already on a tight budget.
And there's the train fee.
I wish they'd open a shop near us.
But don't a lot of stores sell online now?
So you could try that.
You don't get it...
You can get points when you order online...
...but browsing through the store and
making unexpected discoveries is what's really fun.
What's with you?!
You're totally ready to spend it all!
The radishes are almost completely done!
Now we'll put this completely in.
I wonder why this is called a pochi bag.
[Note: pochitto - a smidge | korepocchi - just a bit]
That's from the phrases pochitto and korepocchi.
It refers to a bag you put small stuff in.
Pochitto would be Kansai...
...and korepocchi would be Kanto.
Happy New Year!
This is Takara.
Miyuki-san.
Happy New Year!
Anyway...
...I was wondering where the name pochi bag came from...
Konata...
Pochi bag, is it?
Can't you have a little more faith in your father?
I believe it came from the phrases pochitto and korepocchi...
And couldn't you do that somewhere out of sight?
...and refers to a bag for small items.
Okay.
Time to wish everyone in the game a happy new year.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
In the end I wasn't able to buy any Haruhi goods...
don't cry!
Your friend konakona has just logged in.
oh?
Happy New Years!
Happy New Years! >w
Same lololol
Finally got on. Been busy for a while
Your friend nanakon has just logged in.
It's Teacher.
Happy New Years, Teacher!
Yo! Happy New Years! (^w^)ノ
Let's have another wonderful year!
mmhmm, lets! (>w
And like...
She's always online...
Doesn't she have anything else to do?
Guess that's why she doesn't have a boyfriend.
Go—
Good lucky!
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shirashi!
We're already on the twelfth episode of Lucky Channel!
This sea is hell.
Uh.
Yeah...
As you can see...
...Akira-sama was supposed to
appear in the actual show this week...
...but she suddenly became ill...
A cold, right?
But I put up a cardboard pop-up instead...
...so if you go look carefully...
Hey.
Akira-sama?
And so...
...it looks like Akira-sama's already tired...
...so we'll have to call it a day!
Okay, everyone.
Bye-bee!
I'm absolutely not getting full of myself.
Let you hear the new version of Take it! Sailor Uniform?
So look forward to it?
If you don't watch next week...
...I'll turn into Mars and scold you!
Fumoffu!
We got pretty into it.
That was fun.
Nobody's ordered a song!
Isn't it your turn?
Now is when you're supposed to order a song.
I didn't choose one!
Which one should I do?
I'll look, too.
There's also a menu.
So you can also eat here.
Yep.
That song totally broke my flow.
Should have saved it for later.
What flow?
You know what I mean?
How you sometimes feel like you sing better?
No idea.
Wonder if I can sing this.
Hey!
Godman!
Can you hear me?
There's a tambourine here.
Hey!
We can play it.
Godman!
Fly to me!
Yuki-chan!
Try this!
Sounds nice.
Okay!
This one!
Even a hardcore anime song will work.
Just go.
Anyway, I ordered an exciting one.
You should know this one.
I do!
I'll try it.
Do—
Oops. Screwed up.
It was spur of the moment...
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Miyuki.
When something has completely outstripped the competition...
...and stands heads above the rest...
...we use the word dantotsu to describe it.
That's apparently short for danzen (on the very) top.
This word first appeared in literature...
...after the recent city election...
...where that person won by a landslide...
...on the very top.
Next time:
Savory Day.
「Savory Day」
Look forward to next time!
Hey!
Everyone, have a seat!
Happy New Year.
The year just flew by, didn't it?
Let's have another good one!
'Course...
...I'll be bidding farewell to some
of you guys in three more months.
Guess who I'm talking about.
Teacher!
You don't mean me, right?!
Savory
Day
I can believe, right?!
People always talk about the New Year's mood...
...but I guess there's kind of a weird atmosphere.
But it changes the second school starts.
Unfortunately...
Well...
It's true that New Years wields a mysterious power.
Despite the fact that I spent the first three
days of the year busy working at home...
...I gained weight!
New Year's magic, huh?
The cold weather makes it difficult to burn off your fat.
I did a lot of moving around, though.
Three days of busy work as a shrine maiden.
But you ate just as much, didn't you?
Shrine maiden. New Year's food!
Shrine maiden. Zoni soup!
Shrine maiden. Snacks!
Snacks! Snacks! Snacks!
Shrine maiden. Snacks!
Something like that.
But the pictures of having fun during New Year's...
...usually include badminton...
...One Hundred Poets...
...and kite flying...
...but I've never actually seen someone do those.
Well...
These days, it's dangerous with stuff like electric lines and cars.
I just watched TV and read books.
After those first three busy days.
Um...
I did those.
I enjoyed badminton, One Hundred
Poets, and Pin the Tail on the Donkey.
Doesn't match your image.
My family follows western customs...
...but our relatives in the country are more traditional.
We wore kimonos and went to the temple on New Year's...
...and I had fun with my cousins.
An omnipotent god...
Way more Japanese than I am!
More traditional than my family!
Wait, why Pin the Tail on the Donkey?
In One Hundred Poets...
...they're all 31 syllable poems, right?
Yes.
You read out the first verse...
...and look for the card with the rest of the poem.
You must have skills...
Not at all.
I'm just a beginner.
The experts snatch up the cards in a flash.
Well, more like...
I can't stand playing a game that
makes you feel like you're studying.
People like you who view mental games as a
chore are why Japan's going down the drain.
Why couldn't they use One Hundred Poets for like a card battle?
You could summon a monk.
Think there was a Semimaru!
Semimaru uses a shining attack!
Ono no Komachi uses a lovely strike!
Doesn't that sound fun?
Back to your world, huh?
But wouldn't more physical
games have helped you lose weight?
Be quiet!
It was those stupid rice cakes...
Rice cakes are loaded with calories, aren't they?
One as big as a matchbox...
...is equivalent to a whole bowl of rice.
Which means that Kagami's eating a bowl of rice with each bite?!
Hey!
You also ate rice cakes, didn't you?!
[zoni soup - a broth eaten with rice cakes; New Year's meal]
My mom's gone, so I've rarely had zoni soup and that stuff.
Actually, I don't really eat rice cakes.
That's a waste.
With zoni soup, sweet red bean soup, soy flour rice cakes...
There are so many fun ways to eat them.
Looks like she's gonna lose to the rice cakes again next year...
...Kagami.
What do you have to eat for New Year's...
...instead of rice cakes, Izumi-san?
Stuff like pizza and pasta.
Our year starts with raw pasta.
My dad cleans out the pasta machine at the end of every year.
Did you know?
That thing rusts if you don't use it for a while.
If you use it without cleaning it first...
...the pasta ends up all black and stuff...
So we clean it out...
...and make pasta and pizza!
Sounds very thorough.
Well, Kagami's house probably orders
pizza, and their pasta consists of cup noodles.
More like...
We don't have pizza or pasta on New Year's...
No way!
It doesn't go with traditional foods.
Sure it does!
It goes great with roast chicken!
That's a traditional New Year's food?
Sure it is.
Under western traditions.
That's how it works?
What did you have for New Year's, Miyuki-san?
Me?
Your family sounds all wealthy and western...
...so you probably didn't have traditional stuff or rice cakes.
Maybe you had like a full course French dinner!
Not at all.
I ate traditional foods...
...and I was unable to bite through a rice cake...
...and it stretched like whee!
What's with this walking pillar of moe?
Rice cake goes whee!
But New Year's goes by so fast.
Yeah.
Winter break goes by fast, too.
It's supposed to be a long vacation...
...but after cleaning, writing
New Year's cards, and homework...
...you don't have much time to relax, right?
Hold it right there!
You didn't do New Year's cards this year!
And you copied my homework yesterday!
Oh, yeah.
Did you have your first dream of the year, Kona-chan?
Isn't it supposed to be a good
omen if you dream about certain things?
Yep, yep.
Usually, it's one: Mt. Fuji, two: hawk, three: eggplant.
Officially, you would add...
...four: fan, five: tobacco, six: blind man.
It goes all the way up to six!
But you know...
Who ever dreams about that kind of stuff?
What kind of dream would that be?
And why a blind man?
Pretty much...
Hey.
Do you have to dream about all of those at once?
If all of those showed up in your dreams,
you'd be really blessed...
...but I believe that just one will suffice.
I thought you would have to dream about
a hawk twice and an eggplant three times.
And quite frankly...
Who really remembers what they dream about?
People who care about that stuff are
having way too much fun with New Year's.
You have a point.
In my first dream this year...
...I opened my shoe locker to find my shoes missing.
So I had no choice but to take
shoes from someone else's open locker...
...but the size was wrong.
I looked up the meaning of this dream in
the encyclopedia for dream fortune telling...
...and it said that it's a sign I am
pursuing skills useful to society...
...but it will take a while before I accomplish that goal.
The shoes apparently represent societal standing.
Cheesecake?
Miyuki-san's...
...pretty ambitious.
It's like I kinda understand, but kinda not...
Another person was goofing off on the stage...
...during the coming-of-age ceremony.
Don't they realize they're representing Japan?
Makes you wonder why they even bother going.
No kidding.
I wouldn't want to go to a boring coming-of-age ceremony.
And this girl's gonna grow up to be a bad person.
What are you guys going to wear to your ceremony?
Might as well go with a long-sleeve kimono...
What about you?
Well...
My dad's probably going to have
me wear a long-sleeve kimono.
I can see him doing that.
Yahoo!
But...
When you wear one...
...you'd look more like a little kid going to the festival.
Happy New Year!
Hope ya had fun!
Happy New Year, Cousin Yui.
I haven't seen you in a while.
Well, my husband was here.
And a lot happens during New Year's.
Oh, and my sister had a fever.
She's got a weak body.
Whoa!
It definitely wasn't because I didn't
give her any New Year's allowance!
Don't get the wrong idea!
Only a cop would reveal what she was
really thinking before I've said a thing.
A One Hundred Poets tournament is currently underway...
...and it's been one crazy ride so far.
Oh, yeah.
What did you do on New Year's when you were a kid?
When I was a kid?
Well, I did all kinds of stuff...
Let's see...
Um...
Dot.
Dot.
Dot.
Dot.
Sorry.
I forgot.
No clue.
She really just goes with the flow.
I've never heard her say anything serious.
Guess I outgrew my memories!
Tsukasa's always cooped up under the kotatsu these days.
'Cause it's cold.
I know what you mean!
Kotatsus are so wonderful.
Going to the bathroom's a pain, though.
Yep, yep.
But you shouldn't say that so loudly...
But we have a surefire way to get a person out of a kotatsu.
How does it work?
Konata.
If you stay under the kotatsu too long...
...you'll get stuck.
So your dad doesn't need a kotatsu.
He likes them as much as anyone else.
It's just like a warning.
'Cause we've both fallen asleep
together under the kotatsu before.
I know what you mean!
But they say that you'll catch a
cold if you fall asleep under a kotatsu.
Yeah.
So we turn it off once someone notices.
It's like a mix of heaven and hell.
Like right before you turn it on...
...and after you turn it off, it feels even colder.
I totally know what you mean!
And doesn't it really suck when you get out of bed in the morning?
While we're at it, it's totally freezing after you
get undressed and before you get in the bath.
But not enough to make you run.
You might slip and fall.
And doesn't it suck when you need to go
the bathroom in the middle of the night?
I hate that!
Hey.
This is our stop.
And the walk from the bus to the classroom is also hell.
It's almost Valentine's Day.
It always gets a lot more exciting this time of year.
Every year, it's awkward how everyone tries to act normal...
...but you can still feel the tension in the air.
Having someone special on that day...
...and confessing your feelings...
...and having them reciprocated...
...is a beautiful thing.
You're such a girl.
I just see it as a conspiracy by the chocolate industry.
Well, I guess you could say it's also a special time of year for me.
They have a sale on the unsold chocolate afterwards...
...so I go after the chocolate power to make my own.
And you, you have no dreams.
Money can't buy love!
At least, that's what they like to say...
...but isn't Valentine chocolate a
way of showing love through money?
I guess someone who's only
experienced love in games has some harsh views.
Well, in games, it's all about upping
your relationship level before the day comes.
I don't do anything special for Valentine's.
Guys dream too much.
Nobody managed to trigger the Kagami flag.
What about you?
I'm super popular!
Right...
In your game.
When you talk about flags and relationship levels...
...I seriously get worried about your future.
You can't limit yourself to events in games.
I can't stand those narrow-minded people
who don't know what they're talking about.
So I'm wrong?
Lately, events only take a few hours in game time...
...so Valentine's Day is usually over in a flash.
So what?
But this year, I'm planning on giving chocolate to someone.
Seriously?!
Someone playing the same online game as me.
A friend from your game?
You're giving it to him in person?
I'm not actually going to meet the person.
It'll be in-game.
Since the characters are still human.
Does that even count?
So you just meant a game character.
How dare you insult my bride!
Bride?
We're married in-game, and my character's male.
What?
Wait a sec.
So the guy is giving the girl chocolate?
And wouldn't it be like a girl giving a girl chocolate?
If the other person's a girl...
Don't worry.
The other person's a guy in real life.
Guess it doesn't matter as long as you're having fun!
Got that right.
I wanna go overseas.
That came out of nowhere.
Well, yesterday, Miyuki-san was like...
Females giving chocolates on February 14th is a Japanese custom.
Miyuki-san!
In western society, people of both genders...
...give chocolate and cards to friends and people they like.
That's what she said...
...so a girl like me could still get lots of chocolate!
I guess you could interpret it that way...
...but you sure have a lot of confidence in yourself.
Like you already know for a fact that you'll be popular.
Don't worry.
In foreign countries, little girls...
Okay, stop!
No risqué statements allowed!
Uh...
Will you accept this?!
Happy Valentine's Day!
Here, Kona-chan.
Incredible wrapping...
...for a uniform...
And the inside's all cool and heart-shaped!
I put some effort into it.
Tsukasa's always enthusiastic about this kind of stuff.
She was making them until morning.
And it's only friendship chocolate.
Tsukasa.
You shouldn't give any friendship chocolate to guys.
They'll definitely get the wrong idea.
What?
Anyway, here.
Kagami's giving me chocolate!
Tsukasa was making hers...
...so I just joined in.
You don't want it?
The fact that you always look skilled, but secretly work behind the scenes is so moe!
Zip it!
Shut up and put it away.
Huh?
Kagami?
Here.
This is for you.
Just so you know, it's a just friends thing.
Friendship chocolate.
S-Sorry the shape's funny.
Silly.
The shape isn't important.
What matters is that you made it for me.
S-Stupid.
I told you it's not like that.
Nothing like that?
No.
Just shut up and put it away.
This is my first time.
The first time's the most important.
So did you give anybody chocolate, Miyuki-san?
I gave chocolate to my father and a relative.
I gave chocolate to everybody I'm friendly with.
I gave chocolate to you, Tsukasa, and Miyuki.
Sheesh.
You guys sure had a boring St. Valentine's Day.
Don't need to hear it from someone who lives in an online game.
Oh, yeah.
Your cousin was accepted to Ryouou, right?
She was.
It's pretty far from her home...
...so she'll be living with us starting next month.
She's always been like a little sister anyway...
...so we've been in touch.
Really.
But next to you...
...nobody would be able to tell who's younger.
No, like I said...
She's like a little sister in more ways than one.
She's that small?!
But if she got accepted to our school...
...your cousin must be really smart.
That just sounds like you're being really presumptuous.
Since you're a student here.
But I barely passed the exam.
Exams, huh?
We'll be taking our exams next year.
Guess I'll be spending the whole year studying.
Sounds awful.
Exams...
Should I even take them?
I haven't even picked a major.
You seriously need to start thinking about your future.
Studying, manual labor, and me just don't mix.
What kind of future do you have in mind?
Use a hobby to make profit and make games...
I design games. 'Cause it's my hobby.
Be a self-proclaimed manga artist who can only sell at Comiket...
Megas smoked cheese-nyoro.
Or perhaps, indulge your curiosity
and become a professional writer.
There can only be one truth!
And this isn't it!
No, maybe just a novelist who aims for a niche market.
Since you like computers, I guess art design might work.
Maybe a scenario writer who uses
random material instead of an actual story writer.
Or she doesn't go to college...
Or they're all the same thing?!
What?
What is it?
Manager!
Legendary Girl A...
...has returned!
What?!
She shook us off last time!
Manager!
Manager!
Manager!
Today!
We will absolutely make sure she
reaches the goal known as our register!
Gero.
She seems to be at a loss.
Then allow us to...
...help her find her way!
Okay, everyone!
Let 'er rip!
Okay!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go!
Aw yeah!
Manager.
Attempting to determine Legendary Girl A's objective for the day.
Okay.
Countin' on you.
What's the newest comic out?
Yes.
Volume 14 of Sgt. Frog, sah!
Okay!
Raise the height of our goods to the appropriate level...
...to bring them to the attention of Legendary Girl A!
Okay!
And deploy the flyers!
Tama!
Deployment complete!
Sah!
Okay.
Keep an eye on her movements.
And as Legendary Girl A approaches the register...
...deploy our best-selling goods!
Roger!
Sah!
Okay.
Manager!
Legendary Girl A's objective isn't the comics section!
What?!
Manager.
Switch target to the DVD section.
Okay.
Just to be sure...
...block all side paths so Legendary Girl A...
...heads straight to the new DVD section!
Roger!
Sah!
So sorry!
Tama! Tama!
Oh, my!
Forgive me!
Gero-gero-gero build-up!
Tama-tama-tama build-up!
Okay, okay...
Manager!
She's...
...picked up the item!
I've finally become a winner today!
Comrades!
Let us have a wild celebration tonight!
Yes!
Sah!
It was a feint!
Cheap!!
I'll have to bring out my trump card!
Come...
Bring that bargain, super-rare, out-of-print DVD to me.
Manager.
She is heading for the register.
Okay.
Keep going!
What a beautiful scene!
The crowd inside me is cheering with applause right now!
We did it!
Sah!
Your total comes to 1,785 yen.
I'm short 3 yen.
Sorry.
Please put that back.
We'll be back!
Good lucky!
Okay!
Let's kick this into gear!
We're already on the thirteenth episode of Lucky Channel!
Okay.
As you already know, I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
And...
Yes.
D-D-Drill!
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
D-D-Drill!
It's a pleasure!
That's right.
D-D-Drill!
We're on episode 13.
D-D-D-D-Drill!
Into the second season.
D-D-Drill!
It's like we've reached the fifth station on Mt. Fuji, right?
D-D-Drill!
D-D-D-D-Drill!
Mt. Fuji?
You can drive up to the fifth station.
That's true...
That's right!
I've climbed Mt. Takao before!
Don't you have something else to talk about?
That's true...
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Drill!
Man, uh...
Akira-sama's twin drills look wonderful!
What's so wonderful about them?
The way they go round and round like a shell.
Well...
Uh...
We have a special announcement today.
The results for the Lucky Star figure poll!
Let's have Akira-sama announce the results!
The characters that will soon be getting figures are Konata Izumi...
Akira-sama, do a proper job!
Congratulations!
Sheesh, everybody knew this would happen.
What a joke.
No, no, no...
Just means that the higher-ups think the
actual show is more important than this corner.
Of course not, right?
Look.
The producers agree.
Yeah.
I'll just fall for your little trick.
I'm already used to being backstabbed.
Little trick?
That's an awful thing to say.
And don't tell me that it says you're going to have a figure made.
Of course not!
Okay.
We'll be making a figure of Konata Izumi-san this time.
And the popular Minoru Shiraishi will also get a figure?!
The hell is this?!
U-Uh...
It's time to say goodbye!
So please send us any suggestions or
comments you have about the show!
You can leave them on our home page.
Right, Akira-sama?
I'm leaving.
Er, what?
W-Wait!
B-Bye-bee!
Akira-sama!
Wait up!
Okay.
All the staff members can go home.
D-Drill!
Clap for no reason

Forgot my something.
That fragment of memory I left behind on that day.
It's disappeared.
Along with that girl.
The red sunset was so brilliant.
He's annoying
Don't look him in the eyes
On romantic Jogashima.
Couple who readily agreed to be in the production.
Go ahead and laugh at me for being an idiot.
That's how it should be.

Next Episode
Well, next time on Sgt. Frog:
No!
You mean next time on Lucky Star!
Gero-gero.
Comrade, I have a good idea!
Japanese anime is now a global industry.
If we use it to brainwash the people on Pekopon...
...we can complete the invasion of Pekopon in no time, sah!
You're a genius, Sarge!
Worthless.
A soldier should act like a soldier and use brute force!
Shut your mouth, you red dharma doll!
In this age, whoever controls information controls the battle!
Well, your prehistoric mind wouldn't understand that.
You better watch yourself!
In any case...
「Under One Roof」
Next time:
Under One Roof.
Look forward to next time!
G-Gero!
Yutaka!
It's almost time to go!
Oof.
Okay, little sister of mine.
Today's the beginning of your new life!
Let's go with a bang!
Under
One
Roof
I'm here to report that Yutaka's passed and say hi!
Welcome.
Come on, Yutaka.
I-I'll probably be causing lots of trouble...
...but I hope we can get along well!
Just think of this as your own home.
Yes.
Let me start by congratulating you on passing.
Thank you!
It's a good thing she passed.
Now you can meet that handkerchief girl.
I win at life.
Going back in time
The day of Yutaka's Exams
Um...
Are you all right?
Do you want me to take you to the nurse's office?
Right after the exams
So she talked to me...
...and even lent me her handkerchief!
I'm so happy that I might be able to make a good friend.
But Yutaka...
She might've failed.
That won't happen!
People like her definitely pass!
I know how you feel...
She's definitely smart!
Thank you for the baseless rebuttal.
But you know...
...Yu-chan.
What if you fail?
That's actually possible...
Well, you should be fine.
That's right.
I should be able to meet her on the
day they announce results regardless.
I see.
I have to return the handkerchief.
You will be notified of your results by mail.
And then
the day of orientation and uniform fitting
E-Excuse me!
Here.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I've been wanting to return this.
You came to deliver this?
Yes.
I guess I ended up troubling you.
I didn't expect to ever see you again.
I never intended to have this returned.
I was worried I might fail.
Oh.
I see.
If you're here now...
...you're in the same year.
I'm sorry.
You probably thought I was someone's little sister.
I came by car today.
O-Okay.
Then we'll be parting here.
Um...
I hope we can have a great three years!
What a relief.
I already became friends with such a nice person in high school.
I didn't ask what her name was.
Turning back the clock
Make sure you ask for her name next time.
Present
Are you feeling sick, Yu-chan?
I think I got a little carsick.
I took some medicine, though...
Sorry to worry you.
Yutaka's got such a weak body.
Wait.
That's part of it...
I'll rub your back—
...but you need to realize what your driving's like, Cousin Yui.
Thanks~
Even I get a little blargh...
But I'm the only one from my old school who's going to Ryouou...
And I'll probably get sick again like today...
I'm worried about if I can get along with my classmates.
You're a good girl, so it'll be fine.
You're treating me like a child!
Sickly
Little Sister
Brain...
Pure
Cute
...converting...
Walking Pillar of Moe
If Yu-chan got together with our Miyuki-san, it'd be pretty crazy.
That's right.
I'm in Big Sister Konata's house now.
Big Sister.
Good morning!
You're up awfully early when we don't have school.
Morning.
Actually, I'm about to hit the sack.
I was gaming all nigh—
This really is a different environment!
We have to take exams next year, huh?
We've been getting a bunch of phone calls from cram schools.
It's a pain.
If you use caller ID...
...you should be able to pick out those kinds of calls immediately.
Since they use unlisted numbers.
I'm home!
Caller ID, huh...
I've come home!
My...
Is that so?
That must have been difficult.
Not at all...
It's the same for our family.
Well, my daughter's returned...
Yes.
Until we talk again, then.
Sorry to have taken up your time.
Who was on the phone?
It sounded like you were having a lively conversation.
It was a telemarketer.
Um...
Didn't you say that you could pick out those calls immediately?
But you know...
I was bored and felt like having a conversation.
We talked for over an hour.
This should be your total.
Whyistherealreadyanewitem?!
What's wrong, Kona-chan?
Tsukasa!
This world is always a battlefield!
You can never show mercy!
The other day, there was a little item I wanted...
Should I exchange my points.
I spent half a day thinking about it...
...Nah...but
there's other stuff I want.
Okay!
...and ended up deciding to exchange my points...
I'll go on the offensive!
But now there's already a new item I really want!
Look! Over there!
I don't have enough points left!
What to do?!
You sure enjoy your life.
Uh...
You haven't paid...
Would you prefer smoking or non-smoking?
Well...
We're minors...
...so a non-smoking table, please.
Then please follow me.
I'm going to the restroom first.
Hey, Tsukasa!
Over here!
Welcome back.
I'm back.
Hey...
I've been wondering...
Why are the restrooms in these places...
...usually located near the smoking section?
That's true.
Especially when we're in the non-smoking section.
But really...
I wonder why...
So there's a nearby water source if a fire starts.
They have buckets and hoses, too.
They even have hoses?
They do!
They sure do!
Typical of a person who's never worked out in the real world.
What a pain.
Good grief.
You're annoying!
Or maybe to cover up the stink.
And like...
Don't talk about this stuff while we're eating.
Stuff like the stink or restrooms...
Currently, in the city...
...a number of elementary school girls...
...have been approached from
behind while on their way to school...
There are a lot more cases of kids being targeted.
You should be careful, Yu-chan.
That's right.
You have to!
Well, I can understand the perpetrator's way of thinking...
Really...
He's been all over the news for consecutive days now...
...yet he's still going up to little kids?!
What does he want?!
I really want to tell him something!
Man, I'm jealous.
I have no idea what you're thinking...
...but don't do anything that'll get you arrested by Cousin Yui.
Excuse me!
Coming!
Hey!
I'm here!
Welcome!
Oh, where's Kagami today?
She went out with some friends from her class.
I see.
I'm kinda annoyed and then it feels like something's missing...
I guess you're lonely.
It's gotten really warm lately.
Sure has.
We don't have any homework for spring break...
...so it's really tranquil.
Sure is.
Pretty sure that...
...only people who normally work hard have the right to say that.
Don't hit any place weird!
No more!
Say...
Do you even recognize the characters in these robot games?
Some of them.
I see...
Since your manga and anime preferences...
...were influenced by your dad.
Yep.
In that case...
Didn't you have a hard time understanding what your female friends were talking about when you were little?
Why?
I actually saw more of that kind of
stuff, so there wasn't any problem.
Really...
Huh?
Is that your final answer?
Final answer!
Why can't they just tell us?
I couldn't even breathe.
And his face is scary.
And huge.
Looking at the clock, she must have gotten the question wrong.
The show's already over.
Wait, Tsukasa!
Can you stop guessing if they got the question right based on the amount of time left when they cut to commercial?!
But I can't take the waiting...
And they really drag it out...
Isn't that the point of the show?!
But it's what Tsukasa would do.
Yo.
Yahoo!
Let me introduce you.
This is my cousin, Yu-chan.
N-Nice to meet you.
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
These are my friends Tsukasa and Kagami.
Then you're the ones Big Sister's always talking about...
What does she say about us?
Hey.
What did you tell her?
Though I can guess from her reaction...
See?
Just like I told you.
Did you already have your graduation ceremony, Yutaka-chan?
Yes.
A few days ago.
Graduation, huh?
Brings back memories.
I don't even remember our graduation.
Did you get a second button from anyone, Yutaka-chan?
No, I didn't.
Our middle school uniform was a blazer.
Oh, yeah...
I guess a lot more schools are like that now.
Actually...
...does the practice of getting
something from the person you like still exist?
Really?
That's kinda sad.
Not that I ever did it.
If you read blogs...
...it looks like quite a few people are still doing it.
But you know...
You take it from someone you like, right?
Well, in most cases.
Then...
...wouldn't going to get a button be
the same as confessing how you feel?
Wouldn't it be better to just confess
and get the guy instead of a button?
Ideally, sure.
That's right.
Did you like anyone at your old school?
No.
I was often absent from school...
When I did go, I would soon get sick.
I just made everyone feel bad.
And I'm all small...
...and I look like a child...
...so everyone always teased me.
I never had time to like anybody...
Don't worry!
You'll have no problems if you aren't picky!
Wh-What?!
Pocky!
Yu-chan.
Show me your graduation yearbook.
I wanna see it!
This is kinda embarrassing.
I don't show up very often.
Yu-chan, what class were you in?
You checked the absentee section first, didn't you?!
You could tell?
The differences between middle school and high school?
The fact that joining a club is no longer mandatory.
Doesn't that depend on the school?
Our school's geared towards getting into college...
...so there will probably be more material at a faster pace.
And the commute takes a while...
...so you'll need some stamina.
The decisive difference is that...
...class time naps have grown longer from
grade school to middle school to high school.
Especially during classes you're bad at!
That's actually true!
The teacher sounds like he's talking in a foreign language...
Make sure you don't end up like them.
...and my mind just starts slipping away!
You brought your middle school uniform.
Our uniform is pretty plain...
...so I thought I could wear it normally.
Since I'm no longer close to school.
I see.
What did you guys do with your uniforms?
We gave ours to some younger neighbors.
What about you?
Mine?
Well...
You wouldn't be able to give yours to anyone.
Be quiet.
How rude.
I saved mine for cosplay use like Yu-chan.
C-Cos..?
When you put it that way...
...it really gets on my nerves.
But it's cosplay.
Anyway...
Our old school, huh?
Now that you've brought it up...
...I kind of want to go visit my grade school and middle school.
But there have been a bunch of incidents involving trespassing...
...so people might give you funny looks.
Well, you don't have to worry.
You'll fit in just fine.
Pretty sure that wasn't a compliment.
But vacations sure pass by quickly.
That's true.
Before you know it, it's back to school.
Spring is a pain with physical exams and measurements.
But you've got really athletic nerves. Lucky you.
Hey, Tsukasa.
Which nerves are the athletic nerves?
Hello, everyone!
I'm a little late...
...but congratulations on graduating, Yutaka!
Cousin Yui.
Welcome.
To celebrate...
...let's all go get smashed!
Invite your dad, too.
My treat!
Sis!
We can't do that!
Sis!
Officer, we're still minors.
W-We can't!
She means juice~
Sis.
I don't think we can go in those places yet.
If you just stroll on in...
...they'll never catch you!
I did it all the time when I was a student!
They never caught me once!
No.
We can't!
Your two relatives will get us caught.
So you did~
We can't, Sis!
I see...
Don't mind.
Since Yu-chan's here...
...we could go to Disneyland or something.
Since it's spring break.
Um...
I really appreciate it...
...but I'm already imposing...
...so you don't have to go so far.
And I already went there on a school field trip a while back.
Yeah, I had a field trip like that, too.
But were you okay?
I didn't get sick.
It was fun!
And I was with my friends.
No...
I was talking about the minimum height for rides.
It was okay!
I'm in high school now!
So I was watching this school drama...
...when I realized there are a lot of
differences between middle school and high school.
Guess so.
They stop feeding you in high school.
That's right.
You make your own lunch or eat in the cafeteria.
Or buy a lunch to bring.
Do you make a box lunch every day?!
P-Pretty much.
That's amazing!
This could get ugly...
You're really good at games!
Skilled at many forms of communication!
You can even cook and do other housework!
I've recently learned how much pressure an older sister feels.
You have to work hard with those eyes on you, right...
...Kagami?
Cousin Yui, wild at the wheel.
Hey!
Doing good?
Cousin Yui, comes home drunk.
Homework?
Just put down something random.
Cousin Yui, never serious about anything.
But I guess it depends on the person.
Make it so I can understand you.
Final answer!
Man, I seriously can't take this.
I finally get to record a line for the actual show...
...but I wasn't even on screen!
Doing it again today.
What are they thinking when they make this show?
Again.
Why am I stuck with this lame crap anybody could come up with...
Akira-sama!
The title call.
Title call!
U-U-Uh...
The title call...
Tiny eyes!
Good lucky...
This isn't the time for that.
Unbelievable. Incredible.
Only my voice. My voice.
My appearance was pointless.
U-Uh...
I wasn't on screen either.
Nobody gives a damn about you!
Windy, huh?
Hey...
Did I ask about you?
Hey.
Did I ever mention you?
N-No...
You didn't say a word about me.
So why did you bring yourself up?
Don't be so self-centered.
Are you an idiot?
You're always like me, me, me.
That's called being overly self-conscious.
Make yourself scarce, Shiraishi.
Sheesh, I'm gonna end up with a dirty mouth.
Listen up.
The issue here is the fact that Akira
Kogami wasn't shown in the actual show.
Sure is.
Let me ask you. What am I?
An idol, right?
An idol depends on her looks, right?
Isn't it a given that I should be on screen?
What do you think?
Y-Yes!
You're absolutely right, sah!
I can't hear you.
T-The staff for this episode...
...acted in a logic-defying manner, sah!
What are you writing?
Revenge of Akira Kogami
Project Full Appearance in Actual Show!!!
Okay?
Here's a request from Akira!
Akira needs everybody's support to appear in the actual show.
The world is waiting for Akira!
Please show your support on the home page
and other places
So send in loads of encouragement!
Loads...
Any method works!
Just give them a push!
Say that you're dying to see me appear in the actual show!
Dying...
Just between you and me.
The other members of the cast...
...can't hold a candle...
...to a performance that features Akira's amazing talent and charm!
She's desperate...
She's really desperate today...
You can't wait to see such a pretty and gorgeous performance!
This is your chance!
Don't let it slip away!
Your feedback...
...can make this a reality!
What is it?
So the second this show ends, start getting to work...
Stop her?
Understood.
Um, Akira-sama...
Shut up!
Stop butting in!
I was on a roll!
How many times do I have to tell you not to get in my way?!
What? Already?
I wanted to tell you more about how wonderful Akira is.
You can see a lot more of my true
charm during next week's actual show.
Just kidding.
Uh...
Look forward to next time!
Bye-bee!
It's over.
I'm in pain.
Hey, you.
Go get the producer!
Me?!
First of all...
Yes.
This week's modified manuscript was wrong.
What's the name of this program?!
Uh, Lucky Channel?
It said Lucky Paradise.
Well...
Also...
What is it?
You've got guts to treat me like this!
Just because your last show was a hit!
Hey, producers!
Wait, you really shouldn't be saying that!
Don't mess with me!
Hey!
Miyagi-san!
Hello, I'm Shiraishi!
Okay! Please listen to me!
I've lived my life wishing for excitement.
Who made my dream come true?
Some futures you can guess. Some you can't.
But there's still one thing I know for sure.
Even to the end of time!
Boooon!!
These looping feelings...
...warp everyone in to play with imagination!
One clear, sunshiny day...
...happiness greater than magic...
...pours down with no end in sight.
It could happen!
When we meet again tomorrow...
...we'll be smiling and humming!
Let's bring together happiness!
It's an easy thing to do!
Keep on chasing!
Try to catch it!
We love big dreams, right?
The End
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Minami Iwasaki.
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
Iwasaki-san.
The two of us are supposed to introduce the next episode.
Do you know what it's about?
I don't.
Sorry.
Really?
That's not good.
I don't know either.
Then we'll stop here.
Next time:
「Can't Change So Quickly」
Can't Change So Quickly.
Is it okay that we didn't say anything?
Look forward to next time.

Through the darkeness of this world if I must.
Big guy blocking...
'Cause you'll be there to shine the way.
Past the end of the future.
Here.
Won't let weakness...
...break down my soul.
That was incredible.
I was quite moved.
The first person who came out was so cool.
That guy?
No?
People actually go for that, huh?
Konata, you haven't said a word.
The whole fatigue setting in after an event's over thing, huh?
I guess I was a bit moved myself.
I wonder what this feeling is...
Can't
Change
So
Quickly
What are you doing?
Come on. We're going now.
You're really proactive about some odd things.
Because today's our last chance to
see the cherry blossoms in full bloom.
When you put something off to tomorrow...
...or the day after...
...it ends up raining...
...or the petals start falling.
Oh, yeah.
What happened to the goldfish from the summer festival?
Actually...
...I ended up feeding it too much...
...and it ended up like this.
Huge!
Shogun?!
I took a little too good care of it.
Wait a minute.
Are you sure you didn't feed it something funny?
That's no longer a goldfish!
I can only pray that it's because he's living a good life.
Are you going to eat it?
How could I?!
There's an anime where animals a guy took
good care of return as humans to serve him.
You always bring up hardcore references.
I should probably put it on a diet...
Kagami.
Goldfish Scooping
Are you thinking about getting a replacement?
It's gotten pretty chilly.
We should probably head home.
When you wear daytime clothes to see
nighttime cherry blossoms, it gets cold.
And your butt gets cold when you sit down.
I've heard that the average temperature in March...
...is close to the average temperature in December...
...and April and November are quite similar.
If it were November or December, I'd definitely wear a lot more.
In March and April...
...you just tend to dress lighter.
Isn't it because you're sick of wearing winter clothes?
Maybe it's a way of expressing
how you want it to be spring already.
You look like you're fine, Kagami.
Maybe it's because you're wearing...
Long-wavelength infrared effect
Came prepared.
I'm not wearing any!
That's all you get today, Goldy.
It'd be a problem...
...if he showed up as a wife beater...
As if...
What's wrong with Sis?
Man, that really stings...
I have really sensitive skin.
This season is brutal for me.
Sounds like a pain.
And I stay in the house most of the time.
They have a lot of goods that help for allergies.
Why don't you buy some?
Transform!
I see!
This works!
Reduces the effects of allergies by 99%!
Now he's suspicious on the outside and the inside.
Don't get in trouble with the police.
I'm going to go do some shopping.
Have fun!
Want to come along?
Nope!
Wait, Dad.
You're going shopping like that?
Of course.
Or it'd defeat the purpose.
Here's our next story.
Woman robs convenient store
Last night around eleven...
...a woman broke into a convenience store...
...and attempted to steal the cash.
Hey, Yu-chan.
What is it?
Aren't there a lot more robbers
disguised with allergy gear this time of year?
It sounds possible.
Freeze.
How did this happen?
Tomorrow?
Sure.
Haven't done that in a while.
That's right.
Plus, I'm already done with my homework.
What did you just say?!
You finished your homework?!
For real?!
Unbelievable!
Sorry.
I lied.
Yeah, you know how you have to lie on April Fools'?
Good thing I remembered.
No, seriously...
And you have no intention of doing it, huh?
You must be bored.
You're the only person who would call at this hour just to lie.
Anyway, see you tomorrow.
Yes, this is Izumi.
This is Kuroi.
Is this the Izumi residence?
Teacher.
Izumi, it's me.
Sorry.
I accidentally overwrote a save file...
...on a game I borrowed from you.
Just lying! Hey!
Fooled you!
Today's April Fools'!
There was somebody else as bored as me...
Teacher.
What's up?
The other day, Miyuki-san said...
Even someone like Ms. Kuroi can be a teacher...
...so getting a certificate must be a cakewalk.
...something like that.
That brat...
So the sweet talk was just an act...
Um, Teacher.
I was joking...
Konata called me just so she could lie.
Honestly...
Did you lie to anyone today?
That's unusual.
What was it?
I-I just did.
I lied about lying.
Th-That's hard to get.
And there's no need to force yourself to lie.
Wh-What was Kona-chan's lie like?
Something about finishing her homework on her own.
In retrospect, I really shouldn't have fallen for it.
It's impossible.
If she lied, then she hasn't done her homework yet, right?
Well, knowing her...
...she definitely hasn't done it!
I see...
You were just thinking...
...that it's a good thing you aren't alone, right?
No...
Konata.
Do you have a minute?
Is that interesting?
Unique.
I see.
Konata.
I'm actually thinking about remarrying.
Wait, I know that you're against it.
In your mind, Kanata will always be your only moth—
What?
You're okay with it?
If I get remarried?
Why not?
B-But...
You know...
She'll be your new mother?
What will my new mother be like?
Uh...
Well...
Wh-When you put it that way...
Okay. Here's the next question.
What is the kenjogo form for iku (to go)?
It's gotta be ukagau (to inquire)!
Piece of cake!
That's right.
It's to inquire.
That should be the correct answer.
Sounds right.
The correct answer is mairu (to visit).
O-On second thought, that's right...
Yeah...
I went with the flow there.
What's with the weird atmosphere?
Me too...
This is what happens when you're positive you're right.
Multiple choice quiz, question one.
Which prefecture does not border the ocean?
A. Ibaraki.
B. Tochigi.
C. Kyoto.
It's B!
It's B!
B, right?
This is easy.
The correct answer is B!
Next question.
Of the hardest known problems in mathematics...
...the theorem proven by...
...Princeton's Sir Wiles in 1994 was...
A. The Pythagorean theorem.
B. Taylor's theorem.
C. Fermat's last theorem.
Why is everyone so eager when the answer is obvious...
...but then they keep quiet when they're not sure?
Since it's spring break, we should visit Miyuki-san's house.
That sounds good.
It's pretty far, so I've never been there before.
Miyuki-san's family is rich, right?
I wonder what it's like.
A pool in her backyard?
Nah...
A security fence around the whole place.
No, it's probably a lot more normal.
She probably has a pet.
A ferret might fit her image.
A white one.
Nah, gotta be a dog.
A huge, white dog.
With a huge yard and a white parasol.
She might have a dog.
That's how the conversation went.
You're welcome to visit...
...but please don't expect too much.
I'm sorry to say that I have no pets.
However, while we don't have a big white dog or a parasol...
...one of our neighbors does.
And the neighbor's kid is entering Ryouou this year.
She's also been invited. Do you want to come?
My friend's cousin...
...is entering Ryouou.
It's a small world after all.
S-So sleepy...
Honestly...
It's because you got used to sleeping all morning.
Konata.
Yo.
What?
You also got used to sleeping in?
I've been gaming for three days straight...
I'm about to die...
The only thing they have in common is their laziness!
Miyuki Takara
Minoru Shiraishi
Konata Izumi
Tsukasa Hiiragi
We're in the same class again!
You're right!
That's great.
Good morning.
Good morning, Yuki-chan.
Good morning.
You're in our class.
Indeed.
That's wonderful.
Let's have another great year!
Let's!
Minami Iwasaki
Yutaka Kobayakawa
We're in the same class!
I-I hope we have a wonderful year!
So do I.
Kagami's the only one in a different class again.
I see you guys all the time anyway.
If we weren't in different classes, you'd wear me out.
Sis...
That's too bad...
No big deal.
It's the same as usual.
Besides, someone like Konata...
...will come borrowing notes or textbooks.
You know me well.
So that's that...
Go on ahead.
See you later!
Yo, Hiiragi!
What class you in?
We're in the same class again!
If you count middle school...
...that makes five years straight, right?
Let's have another good year.
Huh?
Some heartless people only look for their top priorities.
There, there.
We're like part of the background!
I wonder how class assignments are decided.
They might try to avoid grouping all the good students together...
...or try to divide up relatives...
...or split up the troublemakers as much as possible.
At least that's what I've heard.
It probably depends on the school.
In TV shows, all the troublemakers end up in one class.
It's more exciting that way.
But high schools are supposed to gather people of the same level...
...so there shouldn't be any big troublemakers.
That's true.
Miyuki...
That's where you say, "You need to
realize that you're a troublemaker."
You don't want to be put on the same level as her, right?
No, that's not true...
The bell already rang.
Teacher sure is late.
That's right.
Everybody, sit down!
Still good.
Barely made it.
No good.
I'm your homeroom teacher, Kuroi.
Now that you've all advanced a year in school...
...stop acting like you're on vacation...
...and start working hard.
Th-That wasn't convincing at all!
Class Representative
First Semester Duties
Well, I won't bug you about studying all the time...
...but this is your last year in high school...
...so I want you to have a meaningful experience.
Okay.
Let's get straight to class duties.
Library Staff
Class Representative
First Semester Duties
Takara.
Can you be class representative for the first semester?
Yes.
Once you've been class rep, it gets attached to your image.
That's true.
Though I don't have any problem with it.
The teacher usually decides roles for the first semester.
Because of all the unfamiliar faces...
...it's hard for the students to choose.
In Ms. Kuroi's case, isn't it less
work for her if she chooses Miyuki-san?
I can hear you.
Teacher's hair was all wild.
But it looks like we'll have another fun class with Ms. Kuroi.
Well, she's a fun person.
The class atmosphere usually depends on the teacher...
I see.
I get it.
So you two are blaming your laziness on your teacher.
I can hear you.
I'm Iwasaki.
Nice to meet you.
That girl's pretty cute.
I was in the same middle school as her.
She never talks.
And she's a downer.
And all she does is read. It's creepy.
But she's actually a really nice person.
So I'm the only one who knows.
I feel a little special.
Next.
Y-Yes!
The first impression is important.
I have to be cheerful.
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
Though I may look this way...
...I didn't skip here from grade school.
Just kidding.
Skipped?
What was that?
H-Huh?
Huh? What?
Did Big Sister's influence turn me into a maniac?
In that case...
I'd like to decide on class duties...
Anybody interested in being class representative?
Guess not.
Iwasaki.
You were class rep in middle school.
Go for it.
Really?
Can you do it, Iwasaki?
I'm sorry.
I'm planning on a different duty.
I'd prefer someone with experience...
What are you planning on?
Working in the library?
The nurse's office.
Teacher!
I'll be class representative!
She's a really nice person!
Cherry blossoms bloom into future, love, and dreams.
Spring...
...tends to gives you the feeling that...
I can't stop my heart from racing.
...something's about to begin.
A new meeting.
Let the two of us spend...
Konata Izumi
A new life.
Konata Izumi
...this touching season together.
Konata Izumi
A new love.
Konata Izumi
This moment of a lifetime...
With your childhood friend...
The upperclassman you admired...
This meeting is the beginning of our story.
Or a strange transfer student...?
Cherry blossom petals dance in the air...
A little anxiety and a lot of expectation...
It's what they call 5 seconds to falling in love.
...carrying our wishes...
Also known as MK5.
That's the happy image you get...
But in reality, you have to start over with people you don't know...
...so it's depressing.
I'm already used to it.
You've got it easy.
Big Sister!
Yu-chan.
Haven't seen you since morning.
That's right.
Not since morning.
Oh.
This is the person I told you about...
The one who helped me.
So you found her.
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you.
See?
Just like I said.
I knew she would pass.
Okay.
But Yu-chan...
You forgot that she could have passed but chosen not to come.
It worked out in the end, so it's okay!
By the way, what are you doing?
We wanted to check where the nurse's office is.
Since I'll probably be visiting it.
I see.
Show us the way, Big Sister.
Okay.
Leave it to your big sister.
Where is the nurse's office?
Nurse's Office
I've never gone before, so I don't know.
Hey now.
You've been here two years, and you
don't know where the nurse's office is?
Well, doesn't that just mean I had a healthy two years?
No, you went there for your physicals.
Oh, yeah.
I don't think I've ever been to the art room.
If you choose music for your fine
art, you won't have a chance to go.
I myself have never stepped foot in the judo hall.
I didn't even know we had a tea room until recently.
Even after going to the same school for three years, huh?
I guess everybody only goes to the places they need to.
I rarely go to the study room.
I go there!
Unexpected.
The silence...
It's perfect for sleeping.
Really...
Oh...
Yu-chan went to find the nurse's office
with the girl who helped her during exams.
They ended up in the same class.
It's a miracle.
When you stop and think about it...
...the fact that I met and became friends
with Kona-chan and Yuki-chan at this school...
...might be a miracle!
Pretty much.
We can only be here together for one more year.
But Kagami was the only one in a different class the whole time.
Don't mention that.
The correct answer is B. hemlock.
It'll be on the test, so keep that in mind.
Hey.
Wake up, Izumi!
Potemkin!
What were you dreaming about?
Sorry.
I'm actually concentrating really hard on not falling asleep.
But Teacher...
They still come!
Those demons of sleep...
With no warning!
No way to defend!
A full-out attack!
Not sure why you're trying to explain yourself...
Maybe this will help you stay awake.
Miyuki-san, you don't fall asleep in class, right?
Is there some kind of trick?
I wouldn't call it a trick...
But I really need my sleep...
...so I go to bed at eleven.
By the way...
...I went to bed at ten during our second year.
No good.
No chance.
Can't copy that!
I remember that this stuff was important, so I took notes...
...but I was asleep half the time, so I have no idea what I wrote.
I can't tell.
But just looking at this makes me feel good about myself.
This is proof that I tried to study.
But what did I write down...
Aren't those formulas?
Ms. Kuroi.
Wow!
You can understand this abomination!
Pretty much.
But that means you weren't dreaming about world history.
Okay.
Big Sister, you're still up?
Guess it stinks.
Oops.
It's already this late?
Maybe somebody's on.
You never learn, huh?
Can't wait for tomorrow.
Good lucky!
This is Lucky Channel, broadcasting to the whole wide world!
I'm your navigator, Akira Pretty Kogami!
And I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
We've already reached the 15th episode of Lucky Channel.
Huh?
This is the 15th episode?
Yes...
Then isn't this your last one?
Uh...
See ya.
Didn't you hear?
The producers told me that...
...starting with episode 16, the show
would feature Akira Kogami alone...
...so good luck.
Uh, that's...
Hey!
Gotcha!
April Fools'!
Oh...
That's what it was...
That's right...
See ya, sucker.
Anyway, you were pretty pumped.
During the Jam of Haruhi...
Nyoron!
...the MC was someone who looked like you.
Really?
Couldn't be...
So when am I going to get a concert?
No idea...
They better tell me early...
...since my schedule's filled up for the near future.
I'll go check right away!
Hurry.
Look!
Hurry
The East is...
Hurry it up...
...is burning red!
Hurry... it... up...
Circle.
Circle?
Producer says okay.
Next time?
Understood!
Next week during this time...
...we'll have a live concert featuring Akira Kogami!
N-Next week?!
F-F-For real?!
They secured a stage?
Yes.
He pulled some strings to get it done.
And bend.
Awesome!
Alright!
Not bad, Itou!
Man...
I can't wait to hear you sing.
No way!
Seriously?
For real?!
Leave the MC duties to me.
So you do know what you're doing.
Believe it or not, I'm well-known for my abilities as an MC.
I'm going all out!
There you have it, everyone!
Let's go crazy next week!
Then we'll see you next week!
Bye-bee!
Oh, yes.
Will Minoru Shiraishi really be back next week?
I'm a lieutenant.
Hey.
Now please listen to me.
What are you going to sing first?
You're not starting with Sunny Sunshiny, right?
The Love Legend of Minoru.
One, two, three, four!
The first song isn't Sunny Sunshiny, right?
Mi-Mi-Miracle! Minorun-run!
Oh, he already started.
Mi-Mi-Miracle...
What?
Sunny Sunshiny!
Huge audience, huh?
What are you singing first?
Uh, well...
How about I start with the Love Legend of Minoru.
For now.
Anyway, in that case...
Whenever you're ready.
What?
Whenever you're ready.
Now please listen to me.
The Love Legend of Minoru.
One, two, three, four!
Mi-Mi-Miracle! Minorun-run! Mi-Mi-Miracle! Minorun-run!
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Inori.
I'm Matsuri.
I'm Miki.
I'm Tadao.
Next time:

Look forward to next time!

Good morning, Kagami.
Yo.
You're in a good mood.
What happened?
I got a new cell phone.
Finally, huh?
Seriously?
Then you can use songs for ringtones and set screensavers.
You're actually like a kid.
Wait a sec.
Do you watch anime and stuff then?
I already switched to one of my favorites.
Mi-Mi-Miracle! Mikurun-run! Mi-Mi-Miracle! Mikurun-run!
That's some song.
But you know...
You have to pick up before it gets to the chorus...
...which makes you stress out and regret it, right?
And if you don't pick up, they'll hang up anyway.
I don't really care about that stuff...
Is that how it is?
Ring
If I had to choose, I'd say Kagami's...
...an orc!
Why?!
I'm the only one who's a monster?!
Yes, hello?
This is Hiiragi.
Yeah...
Too used to answering the phone at home.
She was all mad at me a second ago...
I got a sandwich with balsamic vinegar sauce today...
How come women can switch moods so quickly?
But the other day, my mother...
I'm home!
Yes?
Hello?
Miyuki?
Geez!
Miyuki!
Here, phone!
From Konata-chan!
Um...
Did I do something wrong?
No.
My mother is really bad at deception...
...so you can tell when she's mad.
I believe she just hit her leg against the table.
But that wasn't exactly an issue of deception...
She's exactly the way she seems.
It's a good thing Miyuki knows so much.
I can ask you about anything I don't know.
I enjoyed being praised by Mother...
...so I became accustomed to looking things up.
Miyuki knows more than Mama does.
Now, I enjoy learning as well.
So in other words...
...I did a wonderful job of raising you, right?
That's how the conversation went.
That's some silly conversation.
In any case, I now know that you're
undeniably your mother's daughter.
Are we similar?
Down to the very last gene.
But...
Miyuki isn't just good at studying...
She knows a lot about all kinds of stuff.
There are many sources of information these days...
...and it's fun to learn a lot.
I couldn't do it.
No motivation!
Wanna play!
Rely on others in a pinch!
They say that only children and oldest children tend to be selfish...
That's right.
Aren't you an only child?
I guess it depends on the person.
Not at all.
You could say that I had a model...
...or someone who was like an oldest child...
...in my life.
I don't feel like cleaning!
Laundry is tiring!
Can we order out?
In our family...
...we have two older sisters...
...and meals turn into battles...
...which helps build character.
Yay!
Sukiyaki!
Eat up.
Let's eat!
And then, Kona-chan...
Oof.
...said that cell phones go out of service because
of a thick concentration of these something particles.
Mine.
Really...
And when her battery runs out...
...she says her phone's out of commission.
This one.
Modern girls use some strange words.
Hey.
Leave enough for Tsukasa.
Tsukasa.
You can have mine.
Thanks.
You sound nice...
...but weren't you stuffing yourself?
So having a lot of siblings can be good and bad.
You can say that about being an only child as well.
That's right.
Miyuki-chan spaces out sometimes.
Space out, is it?
You know...
Like the other day...
I can never get sick of the name elegant sea urchin.
What happened?
I was walking and thinking...
...and I ended up running into the door.
You have incredible concentration, Miyuki-san.
That happens a lot, huh?
Not often, though it's embarrassing.
Huh?
Doesn't it mean you have no
concentration if you start thinking about something...
...while you're doing something else?
Huh?
Which way is it?
That sounds like something Miyuki would do.
Indeed.
The other day, I was warming a drink...
I forgot.
I'll have to reheat it.
Many minutes later—
One more time...
And again...
Geez, Miyuki...
You forgot again, didn't you?
Sorry, it just happens.
You're so hopeless.
I'll bring it to you.
Thank you so much.
Click.
Many minutes later—
I forgot.
Like mother, like daughter.
Though it's embarrassing.
When did you start wearing glasses, Miyuki-san?
Midway through grade school, I believe.
So you weren't born nearsighted.
When I was little...
...I loved how my mother would read to me before I went to sleep....
...but my mother would fall asleep first...
...and I would want to know what happened...
...so I would read by myself in the dark room...
...and eventually, my eyes...
But it's best when you're close with your parents like that.
The reason kids these days tend to be cold and apathetic...
...may be a lack of...
...parental love or intimacy.
That's right...
I wonder when the last time Mom gave me a big hug was.
You're clingy...
...so you were really close to Mom until middle school.
Really?
That might be why you're such a good girl.
My dad is still clingy about me.
That might be why you haven't grown up, in a manner of speaking.
Speaking of kids...
...there sure have been a lot cases of kidnapping and confinement.
You seem to be sensitive to that stuff.
Well, first, I'm worried about my dad.
Don't just blurt out scary things.
Well, it more or less has to do with the games I play.
I wish they'd stop since it creates problems for other users.
At the very least...
...this stuff doesn't happen in the games I play.
Oh, yeah.
It's almost been a year.
Since what?
Since I started working.
My coworkers...
...said they're going to do something to celebrate.
That's right.
We've never gone before.
Maybe we'll check out the place you work some time.
As payback for New Year's.
Sure.
It's okay?!
Don't people usually hate that?
Well, half my job is to let other people look at me.
It's called a cosplay café, right?
Let me know before you come.
It can be pretty crowded at times.
We'll do that.
Hey, you guys.
Class started.
Hello?
We just left the station.
Yeah, yeah.
We'll buy it for you.
Okay. Okay!
Did Kona-chan say it was okay?
It's okay...
...but she wants us to go over there and buy this month's Comp...
...and the Lelou** comic for her.
I wonder if we can find it quickly.
She said to remember to ask the clerk to stamp the receipt...
Sounds complicated.
Excuse me.
Do you have a minute?
Can I take a picture?
I'm not Kamigishi.
I'm Hiiragi.
Hey!
What are you doing?!
Could I also get a picture?
Sheesh!
Stop that!
Excuse me then.
Could you say Hiroyuki-chan?
Hi-Hiroyuki...
...-chan?
We're leaving.
This is the first time I've been in one of these places.
It's so big that I'm quite nervous.
She said on the phone that we'd see it once we got there.
Kona-chan would know.
I'd get lost if I were alone.
Is this it?
Now we just need the Lelou** comic.
Not here.
I can't find it.
Excuse me.
Where would I find the Lelou** comic?
That would be this.
Code Ge**s.
You could at least have told us the title...
Can I put this on a point card next time?
Then you'll have to bring this receipt with you.
Okay.
Thank you very much!
Now we just have to go find Konata.
I'm hungry, Sis!
I'm almost done working.
Hold on a bit.
How are we supposed to find our way?
Here
Gamers
I looked it up just in case.
I believe it's this way.
That's our Yuki-chan!
Guess we can only count on Miyuki.
This is the place, right?
Yes.
On the third floor.
Welcome back, Master!
You can have a seat here.
The first hour is 800 yen.
All the soda you can drink.
All the games you can play for free.
All the sweets you can eat.
Can I get this broiled eel?
Currently not available.
Then the shrimp pilaf...
Currently impossible.
Then spaghetti with meat sauce.
It will take fifteen minutes.
Permission?
Okay.
Do it.
They can do business like that?
You people.
What do you want to drink?
H-Hold on a sec!
Hurry it up.
There's a penalty if you take too long! A penalty!
Is this how you should treat a customer?
It's how we do things here.
You're done deciding, right?
I'll have a melon soda.
I have no interest in an ordinary menu.
I'll have milk tea.
What do you want?
I'm looking!
A brigade member shouldn't be this slow!
When did I become a brigade member?
That's the setting in this place.
You're a hundred years too early to be defying the chief.
What a pain...
Then give me an ice coffee.
Order from the chief!
Wait here!
Oh, boy...
Hasn't stunk in a while...
We're going on stage now, so watch.
If we can solve all the mysteries on this planet...
...we can all go anywhere we want!
Even to the end of time!
Boooon!!
Encore! Encore!
Amazing!
They're all very talented.
Ponytail version next!
Ponytail version, please!
She's an exchange student.
A first-year at our school.
My name is Patricia Martin.
Nice to meet you.
We've even put out a CD.
[Konata and Patty]
Here.
[Konata and Patty]
[Konata and Patty]
[Cos it! Oh My Honey]
[Konata and Patty]
[Cos it! Oh My Honey]
[Konata and Patty]
[Cos it! Oh My Honey]
Should you really release something like that?
Excuse me.
Could I get some tea?
Do you want warm tea?
Yes.
Hot tea please.
I'd like a melon soda, please.
Got it.
Uh...
What's this Up-To-Us Mixed Juicy Juice like?
Classified information.
House rules!
This café really exhausts me.
M-My height...
Don't worry.
I'm sure you'll grow in time.
Th-That's right.
Big Sister!
Yu-chan.
And here's a person to crush my hopes...
H-How much taller have you grown since you entered high school?
Man...
I haven't grown in either direction.
You'd better prepare yourself.
No need to fret.
You're still in demand.
Hey, you two.
Have you ever been to a class reunion?
Not yet.
Me neither.
But where did that come from?
Isn't the phrase "you haven't
changed" usually supposed to be a compliment?
But the only people who want to hear
that have probably changed considerably...
...in various places...
So it does concern you.
Okay!
Golden Week's starting...
...but listen up.
You've also got tests right after break...
...but don't forget that you're preparing for exams...
...and use your vacation wisely.
Also...
...you still have a few days left of school before break.
I won't let you take any sick days.
Kamchatka!
The aura emitting from her whole body...
No question about it.
She's Legendary Girl A.
Is today's target that new book?
Or is she after some goods?
Use your head!
Don't forget that we're having a spring audio/visual special!
Not yet!
Give her enough room.
Recommend an item once she's let her guard down.
That's right!
Slowly wait to approach her.
That's it!
Now!
Approach her!
Heading out!
Welcome!
We have these new releases!
Mi-Mi-Miracle!
Kagami?
You made it?
Be right there.
Just killing time while waiting for someone?!
When you're boiling something...
...you use rough cutting...
...and cut them into random shapes.
My...
Really...
That increases the total surface area...
...and lets the taste soak in.
Once you've scooped out the Iye...
...you let it cook on medium for around ten minutes.
It'll become soggy if it sits too long...
...so take it out once you can poke through.
I see.
Somehow, when it's home economics...
...Miyuki starts looking below average.
Now I know how you see us.
Hiiragi-chan.
Want to study for the test together in the library?
Sounds good.
Club activities are on hiatus right before a test...
...so there's nothing to do.
That's why you study.
That's the point.
Well...
I know that...
But when my club time is suddenly free...
...it's like a whole new world is open to me.
When you look at it that way, I can't waste the time on studying.
It gets me all excited.
Anyway, you should realize you're
half the reason for this study session.
Pooped!
That was fast!
Let's take a break!
Maybe you can't concentrate because you have no goal?
Don't you have any dreams for the future?
Dreams?
Not really for the future...
But this time of year, don't you wish you could win the lottery...
...and live the simple life?
Everything's a drag.
Minegishi.
Do something about her.
When I use my head...
...I need sweet stuff!
Once we're done, I'll give you some cookies I baked last time.
Hang in there.
So you bake sweets and stuff.
Can't compare with that Ajiyoshi boy.
Nah, you've got that Ajiyoshi boy licked.
Studying's a pain!
Sis.
I tried making a madeleine.
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah...
I wouldn't lump you with them...
...but I was just thinking that you tend to make similar friends.
Haven't you been overly relaxed...
...because you thought it was only stomatitis?
There sure are a lot more medical programs like this these days.
That's true.
It's scary since it could really happen.
Especially for me.
Actually, after watching this...
...I start feeling like my time's almost come.
Too many possible causes.
Please stop the depressing talk.
I beg you!
Live!
Sis!
Teach me this part.
Um...
Curses, like chickens, come home to roost?
This means...
...that Kazu likes chicken.
When you go home, you'll find roast chicken...
...I think?
Sis.
Translate the next part.
Let's see.
When you make the contract...
Did we ever learn this?
That's right.
This one time when I was working as a shrine maiden...
...a foreigner told me about why the gate is called a torii.
What'd he say?
In the past, people believed that birds would carry the dead...
...so they named it tori (bird) i (here)
because it was a place for birds to rest.
They know way more about Japan than we do.
It might have been faster to ask Kagami...
The freezing Sea of Japan...
Where have my loved ones gone?

Akira Kogami with "Cape of Thirty Years."
Hey!
How is this a concert?
This is the best we could do on our budget!
Don't think you'll get away with this!
It's starting!
Who do you think I...
Would you mind if I talked to myself?
I softly whispered to the seagulls.
Woman, led by a sincere heart...
Frozen by the northern sea winds...

Yo!
Sis!
How'd the test go?
Same as always...
Another disaster.
We have more free time during testing...
...but you end up following your usual schedule...
...so you have to cram the night before, right?
You should act more like someone applying for college...
Under
the
Sun
Thousands of manga and games were confiscated from the suspect's room.
Based on his methods, it is believed that other crimes can be attributed to him.
Another story about this...
Incredible...
There was another person like you on the news.
Every time this happens, it makes me think how it isn't fair.
They always use these kinds of manga as examples.
There are good manga out there.
They just never get mentioned.
R-Right...
I feel kinda bad.
You're a good person!
Usually, people just make fun of me for being a helpless otaku.
Looking at the people I know...
...sisters tend to absorb characteristics from one another.
Like you and Cousin Yui...
Or Kagami and Tsukasa...
I was talking about that with Big Sister this morning.
You're really close to Miyuki-chan.
You're as close as sisters.
I see.
It was absorption?
Kona-chan!
Happy birthday!
I would have forgotten if Tsukasa hadn't mentioned it.
Congratulations.
Thanks, everyone!
It makes me happy when people celebrate my birthday...
...but at this age, I really can't be happy about getting older.
Nah.
It makes me super happy.
Why?
Do you want to get a driver's license?
Because I can play adult games now.
Haven't you been openly playing them the whole time?
Of course not...
You've grown older...
...without aging mentally or physically.
Let me go!
Miyuki probably gets mistaken for someone older.
'Cause Yuki-chan looks like an adult.
When I go out in my normal clothes...
...I occassionally get mistaken for an office lady.
So they skip straight past college.
In your case...
...if you walk around in normal clothes...
...they'll think you're in grade school.
Say what you want.
Starting today, I'm an adult!
What are you talking about?
Besides...
...if you're an adult now...
...shouldn't you be less passionate about anime and manga?
Y-You still need to have a child-like
heart filled with passion and dreams!
Make up your mind...
This?
While Big Sister's at work...
...we're going to secretly prepare a birthday party for her.
Sorry I'm late!
Okay!
Let's get everything ready.
Yes!
Happy Birthday
Big Sister
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
And here's a call from Konata.
Wonder if she'll be coming home soon.
Konata?
Sorry!
Forgot to tell you...
...but my coworkers are throwing a party for me...
...so I won't be eating dinner at home.
And I'll be coming home late.
Yutaka.
Doesn't this taste great?
We worked hard.
Yui-chan.
You can take that off now.
Future aspirations, huh...
I have dreams and stuff...
...but it's kind of hard when you stop and think about it.
That's right.
The major you decide on...
...will have an effect on your career.
First is nutritional science.
Second is fashion design.
Third is marketing.
Since I like cooking and sewing.
So you wrote down your dreams.
And what about you, Miyuki-san?
I want to be a doctor...
...so while I didn't write down colleges...
...I put medical schools for all three choices.
That's our Miyuki-san.
You have a clear goal.
What about you, Kagami?
Me?
My first choice is law.
My second choice is economics.
My third choice is literature.
Sheesh.
Too boring.
Is that a bad thing?
What about you?
First Choice
Brigade Chief
Second Choice
Nanto Shinken Master
Third Choice
Storyboarder
Here we go.
Some people try to turn it into a joke.
Actually...
...do you have any talents besides making faces?
Talents...
I can name every Poke**n!
Th-That's definitely amazing.
But it has nothing to do with your future.
Here it is!
I'll go pay for this.
When you buy magazines and manga...
...you always take one from the bottom.
Everybody's already touched the ones on top.
I'd rather buy a clean one.
I know what you mean.
Like when I go to a sushi-go-round...
...I order straight from the chef...
...instead of taking them off the belt.
You know...
Most of the ones on the belt are already dry.
You do that?
What a bad customer.
No way!
You don't?
What a scrooge.
I've been wondering...
How can you stand reading books that are all text?
Don't you get sleepy?
But this is a light novel.
It basically feels like reading manga.
Sure about that...
There are plenty of insert pictures...
...and the writing is simple.
Why don't you give it a try?
W-Well, you know...
They already made an anime of it.
So I'll just watch that.
If it were a manga...
...you'd be talking about how the original has its own merits...
...and check both out.
Just read it already.
I must respectfully pass.
But you know...
You read lots of stuff besides light novels.
How should I put it...
When I become more culturally refined...
...my soul becomes richer.
Well, it's like food for the soul.
I see.
What is it?
By that reasoning...
...the snacks are for making your body richer.
Shut up!
Aren't there also light novels...
...serialized in the magazines you read?
Not just comics.
I look at the pictures...
So despite everything you say...
...your love is pretty weak.
You skim, huh?
Fine!
Be that way.
I'll read it!
Hey, it's okay.
No need to push yourself.
I only skim 'cause I have lots of other stuff to read!
Fine by me.
I didn't say a thing.
Oops!
I forgot my world history textbook.
I left it on my desk after studying.
Konata.
Lend me your world history textbook.
You didn't take it home, right?
Okay.
Did you forget yours?
That's unusual.
Here.
Hiiragi.
This is one fun textbook.
No, this is...
Not getting anywhere...
Guess I'll find something to drink.
Sheesh.
Huh?
Thought there was some leftover from last time...
Gives me a chance to get some fresh air.
They're closed!
This is some kind of challenge, isn't it?
Your total comes to 320 yen.
Huh?
What's wrong, Sis?
Yeah...
When you're in a bad mood...
...you make a bunch of little mistakes...
...which just makes your mood worse, right?
I know what you mean!
You can't seem to do anything right.
Like a negative spiral?
That's right!
I baked a cake.
Want some?
Yay!
Studying is rough...
...so you have to take breaks now and then.
That's it!
I'll bake cookies tomorrow!
That'll relieve stress.
I'm counting on you!
Afterwards...
Now I've got a new source of stress.
Right?
Don't you agree, Iwasaki-san?
That's right.
Those two are so busy that they keep missing each other.
I know what you mean.
That's right.
Big Sister is applying for college...
...so I shouldn't disturb her studying!
Sorry...
I'm going to talk softer.
Yu-chan.
Let's play a game after you're off the phone.
Get your game on!
Say what?!
Guess this is the last year I'll be wearing this uniform.
That gets me thinking...
There's something inside.
My favorite handkerchief that I thought I had lost...
It was in my summer uniform's pocket, huh?
Didn't we have some wasabi octopus?
What is this?
What was this?!
It's changed so much I can't tell...
It sure rains a lot in the rainy season.
Sure does.
It starts getting really hot...
...and then we switch to our summer uniform just in time...
...but the temperature can suddenly drop, which sucks.
You guys are still here?
You're lucky since you can change your clothes whenever you want.
What are you talking about?
It's so much easier when you don't have
to think about what to wear every morning.
You're really wack, Teacher.
Ya-ho!
It's the rainy season!
So humid!
Sis.
Cousin Yui.
It sucks how it's always raining.
Do you want some tea?
Please.
On a happier note...
...it's almost been a year since you got married, right?
That's right.
Time sure flies.
The image of a raining sky...
Is like the image of Cousin Yui's heart when her husband
is away on business with their first anniversary coming up...
Her heart is...
Sorry...
That was my fault.
It's okay.
I'm used to this kind of pain.
Here.
Have something warm to drink.
But I'm still depressed...
It's delicious.
That's a relief.
Sheesh.
At this rate, my love's going to rust eventually!
If you took it to an auto repair place...
...it'd probably be good as new after 45 minutes.
You could at least comfort me...
Sorry.
Force of habit.
Hello?
So you can come home!
Didn't even take 45 minutes.
It was like an instant.
That's right.
You haven't gotten your clothes back from Matsuri?
That's bad.
If you don't ask for them back soon...
...she'll say they're hers.
That would be bad!
I really like those!
I envy Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san...
...for having two sisters.
Pretty much.
Really?
In my opinion...
...I'd rather be an only child like you two.
Right?
I get that feeling sometimes...
But you know...
...you can do so much more with a bigger cast.
Like the story set in olden America...
...of a mother and her four daughters...
...waiting for the father to return.
Or an enigmatic band of female thieves who target art.
One, two.
Huh?
One too many.
Seriously...
She turns every conversation into
something about anime or games.
Hey, Kagami.
Did you buy the stuff for dinner?
Did you forget to tell her, Tsukasa?
Sorry...
What? What?
What's going on?
Geez. Did you forget?
Mom and Dad are out tonight.
Their trip was today?
So then...
...we were supposed to buy groceries for dinner.
I completely forgot.
I called Kagami's cell...
...and left a message.
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
Matsuri.
Just use what's in the fridge.
I finally get a chance to cook...
Just let it go this time.
Sheesh.
This is all your fault!
Sorry...
Fine.
I'll go now.
Geez...
You just had to go and say that.
But...
And does she even know what to buy?
Geez, man...
She doesn't even like to cook that much.
Why's she so worked up?
Sis!
Tsukasa.
Sis...
You don't have the shopping list, right?
They're late...
If you're gonna worry...
...you should have gone yourself.
You're late.
What's wrong?
Matsuri was really worried.
The usual store was out of saffron.
I said that curry powder would work...
...but Sis insisted that we find some, so
we went to the supermarket farther away.
Geez.
You didn't have to do that.
So sorry.
Come on.
Let's make dinner.
Whew, I'm starving.
Here.
Sorry for the wait.
That just leaves Matsuri's masterpiece.
I'm done!
It looks great!
Looks like it was cooked just right.
Hey, Matsuri.
When did you learn how to cook this?
I went to this one restaurant with
some college friends a while back..
...and this was on the menu.
It was so good...
...that I wanted to let you all try it...
...so I asked for the recipe.
I'm surprised they gave it to you.
Anyway, chow down.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Listen to this.
Your father got the date wrong.
What do you mean?
The reservation was apparently for next week.
Straight out of a comedy...
Dinner now?
You haven't eaten?
Paella, is it?
Matsuri made it!
Oh.
That's amazing!
But Kagami bought the ingredients for it.
She went all the way to the farther supermarket.
Then I'll help myself.
Good idea.
This is pretty good.
Who took the mussel?
Mussel?
Was I not supposed to?
Unbelievable!
I was saving that for last!
Then write your name on it.
Geez. Stop fighting.
Yo.
I'll hang out with you after school today.
Do you need to buy something?
Shin** Yamada's new book.
Though, we have a bunch of homework lately...
...so I don't really have time to read.
I also have a pile of unread manga by my pillow.
But I end up going for a new one.
I kinda know what you mean!
Finish your old stuff before you buy new ones.
Well...
It's reassuring if I buy it first.
Or I end up feeling unsatisfied otherwise.
Right?
Don't look at me.
Good lucky!
Okay!
Let's have a blast today!
We're already on the seventeenth episode of Lucky Channel.
Okay!
Your navigator...
Red roses have thorns!
The platypus of the idol world!
Akira Kogami!
And...
Hello!
...we've invited a really big guest today!
How long are you going to make me wait?!
Crap.
He really did come back.
Sorry, sorry.
Here he is...
Um...
Today's guest...
Special Guest
Meito Anizawa-san
...is the Anime Manager:
Meito Anizawa-san.
Okay!
This program is too weak!
But...
Um...
Lucky Star is a slow and relaxed anime...
...about completely ordinary high school students.
Which is why...
...Lucky Channel should be considered...
...slow rather than...
That won't work!
Where'd he go?!
Fast!
Listen.
Do you know what the three factors
for determining an anime's success are?
The three factors?
Um...
Voice actors, animation, and script?
Wrong!
My back is burning red!
The answer is...
The answer is?
The staff and cast's love for the show!
And time!
And production cost!
Well, those factors are all out of our control...
Understand?
It doesn't matter how good the original work was!
There's no point if the script is bad!
It doesn't matter how hard the voice actors work!
It won't work out if the characters aren't in color!
Just look at Shiraishi.
N-Now I'm white(shiroi)!
Each respective part requires its resources!
You have to put your all into the work!
Love and passion are what...
...truly create a beautiful piece of work!
Is that how it works?
You.
You're currently Akira Kogami-san, correct?
Currently?
I've always been Akira.
When you were Rou**n!
Gao**nger!
**tato!
Mai**i!
Didn't you have love?!
What are you talking about?
If you still have regrets...
Nope. None.
...you should burn yourself out as Akira Kogami!
Like I was saying...
Okay!
I will burn myself out as Minoru Shiraishi!
Well said, Shiraishi!
Okay, first of all.
How to work a live event!
Over?
You were MC at an event recently, right?
Bye-bee...
You were watching?
Of course! It's my job!
Good work, everyone!
It was a huge job.
I'm leaving now...
My nerves were a wreck the whole time.
You still have a lot to learn!
Shiraishi can handle the rest.
First, your ad libs are weak!
Yes!
You shouldn't be losing to Sugita—
Minoru
Shiraishi
Theater
Ma'am!
Are you unsatisfied with your husband?
Hello. Minoru Shiraishi here.
Now, please listen to me!
Sweet sunshine!
Looks peachy, doesn't it?

Hey, Kagami.
Do you like chocolate wafers?
I do...
Really.
Then here.
Enjoy!
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot!
I have more!
I have even more, so help yourself!
Wait a sec.
Why do you have so much?
Well, you know those toys that come with snacks.
I can never seem to get the one I want...
...so I end up buying a whole bunch.
Yeah...
Some people just want the toys and ignore the snacks.
To
Each
Her
Own
Fox.
Um...
Squirrel.
Dog.
What are you babbling about?
Oh.
Just wondering what kind of animals everybody might be.
I like to play tricks, so I'd be a fox.
Based on her image, Tsukasa would be a dog.
Yu-chan's like a small animal, so she'd be a squirrel.
I see.
So you probably want to say that I'm a tiger or wolf or something.
Nah.
You get lonely really easily, so you'd probably be a bunny.
Plus, your pigtails look like bunny ears.
That kinda feels embarrassing...
...so stop.
This is fun!
Me?
A bunny?
What about everyone else?
Cousin Yui is hyperactive, so maybe a leopard.
Iwasaki-san is all cool and suave, so maybe a hawk.
Yuki-chan has that whole white feel...
...and then she just shouts fluffy for some reason...
...so probably a sheep.
Fumoffu.
Nah...
Miyuki-san has to be a cow!
Around there...
That's what an old man would say...
We were at Konata's place yesterday...
...and saw some of her writing from grade school.
My...
Is that so?
But you know...
Konata may look like a sloppy person...
...but she actually saved that stuff.
Dad told me to keep that stuff safe.
But the real surprise...
...was the list of her dreams for the future.
Veterinarian and lawyer...
Regular jobs like those.
Really.
Well...
The way her dream changed
every year was definitely Konata-esque.
When you look at those...
...you can tell what kind of games and manga I liked at the time.
I get it.
That's what it was.
Back to that again.
Then again, some people put down bride for their ideal job.
That's not even a job.
That's cute!
No.
And like, Tsukasa...
I'm talking about you.
R-Really?
This is why airheads are hopeless.
Airheads tend to not realize they're airheads.
It's not an issue of being an airhead!
That may be true.
Just so you know...
That includes you, Miyuki-san...
Is something the matter?
Miyuki-san.
How bad is your eyesight without glasses?
Under 20/200.
Really...
I heard somewhere that eating blueberries is good for your eyes.
Indeed.
There are also carrots, which contain vitamin A.
Green-yellow vegetables such as spinach.
Pork, which contains vitamin B.
And items containing protein such as sesame seeds and liver...
...are said to be good for your eyes.
Also, laser surgery is the subject of much attention.
But I'm not brave enough to try it.
And I've seen shows about eyesight training on TV.
You know a lot.
Well, I've only named a few of the many options.
But why hasn't your eyesight gotten better if you know so much?
I haven't actually used any of the methods I know.
Why not?
Well...
I wonder why...
You should give it a try!
Like that eyesight training thing.
Right now?
Well...
First, you close your eyes.
And open them really quickly!
Then you look left, right...
...up, and down...
...without moving your head.
Miyuki-san!
Your head!
Your head is moving!
Wh-Wha—
Huh?
H-Huh?
Th-That's strange...
You can stop now...
I may have ended up exhausting my eyes...
Won't that make your eyesight even worse?
Hey, Kona-chan.
What's moe?
When you put it that way...
It's definitely used to express that you like something...
...but I don't really know the specifics.
What?
So you use it without knowing the meaning?
I'll just say that anyone who
understands the general meaning is hardcore.
Not that it really matters...
...but I kinda understand.
We've got dogs from all around the world!
Okay!
Puppies are so cute!
Dad.
Let's get a dog!
Hey, Tsukasa.
That's easy to say...
...but can you train it, walk it, feed it...
...and take care of all the other things?
And puppies and adult dogs look pretty different.
Are you prepared to care for a living being instead of an object?
Y-You're right...
I need to think it through...
B-But you sure know a lot about it, Sis.
That's 'cause, yeah...
I'm also pretty simple...
So I went and looked stuff up.
Look, Konata!
You like this artist, right?
Read it.
Fine.
You're such a pain.
Your face is really close.

Um...
Do you need something?
I was wondering how far you'd gotten.
Did that Osano person already show up?
No.
That's still beyond my limits.
Come on.
Read faster.
There sure are a lot of elections this year.
It's killing me.
Really?
What's with the gloomy faces?
Students should go home and study.
Teacher.
We were talking about how there have been too many elections.
Where did that come from?
Election coverage messes up the
schedule for regular programming!
The first airing of this one show was late by four hours!
And then they have updates in the middle of the program!
And the L-shaped ticker just makes the screen smaller!
But you know...
Election coverage is educational in terms of current events...
You shouldn't keep going on about anime.
Besides, air times change even without elections.
Stuff like K-1...
...pushes back the regular programming.
Don't you like martial arts?
Konata
I have experience, but I'm not that interested!
Even anime has special programs sometimes, right—?
Nanako
My honey—!
Konata
But they don't run overtime and create problems for the following show, so it's okay!
Nanako
Bah, a college applicant should worry less about that
and study—!!
Nanako
Konata
Gotta finish with a power attack—
Sorry for the wait.
Kona-chan doesn't have an umbrella.
You could at least check the weather forecast.
Maybe I should be like guys and just not care and go home.
But I wonder why boys don't mind getting wet.
Because they don't have to worry about bras showing through.
I get it.
It makes sense...
...but don't just blurt it out loud.
Don't you have any shame?
So...
One of you lend me an umbrella.
Well...
We go home together...
...so I guess we can make do with one.
Thanks so much.
You don't leave an umbrella at school?
But you leave all your textbooks here.
Well...
I had one here...
But I used it once, and I haven't remembered to bring it back.
It's not a daily routine or anything.
So you only remember if you've made a habit of it.
Hey, Suzume!
Wait up!
Oh, yeah.
When you wear a raincoat and galoshes...
...you look pretty lame.
That's true.
It makes you look like a kid.
So why is it so attractive in art?
Like I would know.
Yo, Konata!
Good morning!
Er...
What's wrong, Tsukasa?
I got in trouble 'cause my cell phone bill was too high!
I rarely use my phone, so I only
have to pay the monthly access charge.
Monthly Access Charge
Really...
Economical, isn't it?
So you say...
...but if you barely use it...
...the monthly access charge is already a waste.
Don't sweat the small stuff, Kagami.
I got a message.
Please buy eggs on the way home.
Understood.
I'll go buy some...
...on the way home...
...with Sis.
Hey.
You're talking with your parents, right?
Doesn't it end up more polite when you're using text messaging?
Well, I pretty much know what you mean.
It'll change once you get used to it.
How long have you used this?
Maybe a year.
How long before you usually replace it?
Isn't two years about right?
That's around when the battery starts dying.
I'm going to double...
No, triple that time!
Just you watch!
I don't get the point.
I take good care of my possessions.
I make them last.
You're not even using it.
Yeah...
Some people splurge on their hobbies...
...but pinch on everything else.
Sorry, Sis.
Can I borrow your world history textbook?
Again?
Geez, you're hopeless...
Here.
Be more careful next time.
I'll return it later.
Your sister's pretty careless.
She sure is.
That's why I have to be the responsible one.
But maybe it's that...
She has somebody to rely on...
...so she lets loose.
In other words, your existence allows her to be that way!
That sounds really convincing...
Hiiragi.
What time is it?
There's an alarm clock right in front of you.
There is.
A-A victim of Hiiragi's legendary morning violence!
Just to be clear...
It fell and broke.
Tsukasa.
You can read manga...
...but you should read the newspaper every once in a while.
It's good to know what's going on in the world.
Um...
Th-The newspaper's hard to read...
I can't tell where the next line starts.
Thought it might be something like that.
You there.
What is it?
Could you call Kobayakawa-san for me?
Tell her the third-year, Izumi, is here.
Y-Yes.
Kobayakawa!
A third-year, Izumi-senpai, is here!
What is it, Big Sister?
Man...
It's so fun how they're suddenly
polite when they realize you're older.
So cute.
I wish I could be tall like you, Iwasaki-san.
I wonder why there's such a big difference.
I can't say for sure...
...but it may be because I drink lots of milk.
I see!
So it's the result of your daily efforts!
No...
Life isn't so simple...
I was trying for growth of a different kind...
Since it's raining...
...we're gonna play dodgeball in the gym today.
You seem the type to be the last person standing, Iwasaki-san.
Since you look strong.
I actually end up being one of the
last ones left if I'm on the near side.
Maybe it's 'cause I'm hard to hit since I'm small.
They both survive...
I'm not even that good at dodgeball.
...but for very different reasons...
I'd kinda feel bad if I hit Kobayakawa-san.
But I don't really understand it myself.
That's too bad.
We're on different teams.
Looks like we're together.
Iwasaki-san looks like she's good at sports...
...and she won't hold back, so it's scary.
Head... Out of the question
Upper Body... A strong hit might make her feel sick
Lower Body.....She might fall and get hurt
But what if I let someone else do it—
But what if I let someone else do it—
I got placed on the outer side...
...so it's okay.
That's good to hear.
Iwasaki-san's really a nice person.
So Kobayakawa-san is attacking?
And Iwasaki-san is on the inner side?
So I'm recei—
Er...
I mean defending.
I was attacked by infirmary staff...
Are you okay?
You sure are amazing, Iwasaki-san.
You hit one target after another.
Really?
Your movement and reflexes are great.
Not particularly.
Oops...
Is she mad I made a big deal about it?
No.
She's embarrassed.
Really?
That makes me feel better...
But it's hard to tell...
I see...
So she's the type that's easily misunderstood.
So people who don't really know her...
...get a different impression...
Have you gone on any trips after you got here?
I went on a pilgrimage to all the sacred places.
Sacred places?
Yes.
I visited Japan's three most sacred places.
You mean like Kamakura, Kyoto, and Nara?
No.
Akiba in Tokyo.
Nipponbashi in Osaka.
And Osu in Nagoya!
And I also visited some sites around here.
You mean like Tokyo Tower and Asakusa?
That's wrong!
Nakano...
...and Kichijoji!
Um...
What's wrong?
I think some dust got in my eyes...
Are you okay?
Tell me if it gets to be too much to bear.
I'm okay.
Good situation, isn't it?!
No!
I shouldn't look at my friends with perverted eyes!
Hello!
Hey!
Come on in!
I'll go get drinks.
So many books...
This is all we have...
So Hiyorin once had such a phase...
Kill me now...
Really, just kill me...
And this would be now.
Oh, sh—
You can tell she's improved.
You're right.
She's really good!
This picture kinda resembles Iwasaki-san.
Takarazuka Revue, huh?
Huh?
Is that me?
Is this like a fairy tale?
Please let me see it when it's done.
No!
I shouldn't draw my friends in perverted ways!
Tamura-san.
Shall we go to Maiden Road?
That was the plan.
What's Maiden Road like?
You don't know?!
Neither do I.
Good grief.
Maiden Road, huh...
Maiden Road...
...is a street west of
Sunshine 60 in Ikebukuro, Tokyo.
Many stores sell manga,
anime, and character goods.
It's as popular as Akiba in
terms of attracting hardcore fans.
However, unlike Akiba...
...the customers
are mostly female...
...which is why it was
named Maiden Road.
In other words, it's a
gathering place for fujoshi.
Fujoshi?
Written as rotten girl...
Pronounced fujoshi.
They're rotten?!
Well...
That's one way to look at it...
Y-Y'know!
The three-second-rule! The three-second-rule!
If it's under five seconds...
...there won't be any bacteria!
What?
We didn't say anything.
My beloved meatball...
What happened to the three-second-rule?
Well...
Just let me say that it depends on the situation.
Good lucky!
Okay!
Let's have another blast today!
We've managed to make it to the
eighteenth episode of Lucky Channel!
Okay!
You all know who the navigator is by now!
Akira Kogami!
And...
Yes!
Akira-sama's assistant...
...working hard again today...
Minoru Shiraishi!
Well, today's theme...
...is the introduction for all of the new characters...
...who have joined the regular cast!
All of them!
Too many!
First, the addition to the Izumi family...
Konata-san's cousin.
Yutaka Kobayakawa-san.
And her classmates...
Minami Iwasaki-san.
Hiyori Tamura-san.
Patricia Martin-san.
In addition!
We have Kagami-san's classmates.
Misao Kusakabe-san...
...and Ayano Minegishi-san.
It's gotten rather lively!
As you may have already noticed...
It's blocking me.
...the new characters have been appearing in the opening...
Hey.
I said that it's blocking me!
How many more characters are they going to introduce?!
It went flying!
We're on the eighteenth episode!
What happened to my appearance?!
That's right, Akira-sama.
Didn't you just make an appearance?
That adorable image of you in a raincoat and galoshes.
Yeah.
What to say...
Last week...
...I was able to talk with our guest, Anizawa-san...
...and he told me that an actor needs initiative!
And presence!
Indeed.
Your appearance today...
...brief as it was...
...was screaming to me, "Akira Kogami is here—
You sound passionate.
Hey.
Yes?
Hey!
Ah, no.
It's nothing.
Oh, no!
It's time to say goodbye.
So there you have it.
We're waiting for you to send us any
questions or comments you have about the show!
Hey.
Who is it?
You can direct them to our home page or the radio show!
Then bye-bee!
Turn that thing off!
Then good work!
Was it a message?
No.
No, it wasn't!
Was it a message?
N-No way!
Of course not!
Who's it from?
Uh, it was from my parents.
About what?
Well, they wanted me to go visit...
What was your reply?
Uh, you know...
Say it.
Well, basically...
I've always been looking...
...for my partner in destiny.
I'm sure you're the one.
Though I've got no proof to show.
When I see your smile...
...this ordinary life...
...magically starts to shine.
Like you cast a spell on me.
You're the one who taught me...
...the joy and suffering of love.
No matter how long the road ahead may be...
...the two of us need not fear.
I'm so very happy...
...I could spend this special day with you.
I'll protect you for eternity...
...with everything I have...
I promise you...
Okay.
Kinda screwed up on the falsetto.
Sorry.
Sorry.
It was touching!
Touching!
Thanks.
Touching!
Thanks.
That's so old!

So, I have a pet dog in this game...
...and it's so cute that I start talking to it.
You know how...
...when you talk to animals...
...your voice gets all soft and affectionate?
Except this was in a game.
I know what you mean.
Lil' Goldy
When I talk to my goldfish...
...I lapse into baby talk.
I get talking to dogs and cats...
...but people who talk to fish must be pretty darn lonely.
What did you say?!
That's discrimination!
What's with the patronizing look?!
Oh, yeah.
I've been wondering for a while...
When people call hot dogs...
...wieners...
I wonder what that means.
U-Um...
It would take a long time if I went into detail...
...but it was definitely derived from a German word.
Okay.
Raise your hand if you just thought of something naughty.
2D
has
Substance
Observations
on Gu***m
Oh, yeah...
Gu***m is still ridiculously popular.
Your dad also ***** it.
There are all kinds of Gu***m.
Like V...
And W...
And X...
And I saw 'em all when they first aired!
You could call it passion...
...or my duty as a fan!
In that case...
...would you watch Gu*dam: The Serial Murder Case...
...or Detective Gunda* if they started airing?
As a Gu***m fan...
...I suppose that I have a **** to watch it.
**** is kinda...
But it's a ***** you can't call it by a letter.
All this talk about **ndam has reminded me...
Despite appearances, I'm already *** years older than *muro.
Time passed in a *****.
And in two more years...
...I'll be the same age as B****t-san.
Can't even imagine it!
Well, you know...
B****t-san is a pretty *** character, even in the Gu***m world.
Same goes for Ha**n-sama...
Actually...
You're ***** for your age...
...so I wouldn't use *** for a standard.
You could at least say that I look ***** for my age.
Nah.
You're so cute!
Our neighbor gave us something nice.
A souvenir from vacation, apparently.
What?
A pot?
You grew up to be my kind of girl!
Such a cutie.
It's hot, Dad.
And that was a dangerous statement.
Morning already, huh...
I got wasted last night...
...so I figured I'd be out till noon...
Guess I'm still young.
This is the morning news for Monday, July 2nd.
Early this morning, a man at a restaurant...
Huh?
What about Sunday?
What happened to my day off?!
...yelled, "Hey, this ramen sucks!"
I always plan on studying for tests at night...
...but I end up getting sleepy.
So I asked Sis for advice...
You don't like horror movies, right?
If you watched one...
...wouldn't that keep you up all night?
Seeing how you crawled into my bed last time.
And so...
...I didn't get sleepy after watching it.
An older sister knows just what to do.
But then...
...once it got dark...
Thump
...the slightest sound from behind would make me jump...
...which made it even harder to focus on studying.
And I ended up not getting enough sleep...
...so I was tired in class.
But for someone who claims to dislike horror...
...you watch those movies quite often.
It's not that I choose to watch them...
My mother's the same way.
Hey, Miyuki.
I rented this.
Want to watch?
It's too scary by myself.
The people who can't stand it...
...actually watch them more often, right?
Perhaps they want to be scared.
You're wrong, Yuki-chan!
In my case, I really can't stand them!
Iwasaki-san.
Do you know the answer to this one?
I worked on it for a while...
...and I couldn't figure it out...
...so I was going to ask Miyuki-san.
I see.
We're really lucky to have
upperclassmen to rely on in these situations.
I was talking with Iwasaki-san about that at school today.
What?!
She has that much faith in me?!
This girl is going to soon discover
how the world is a very harsh place!
Hey, Cousin Yui.
Did you ever study together with Cousin K?
Nope.
That's a common situation in games.
When a boy and girl get together
to study, they can never concentrate.
When you can't concentrate, you
start fantasizing about stuff you like.
Your hidden side starts to show.
Big Sister.
I need help with a part.
Oh, I happen to be busy, so ask Cousin Yui.
Study, study...
D-Dirty move!
M-Maybe it's 'cause I went to a different school.
I never learned this stuff.
I see.
I-It hurts...
Now I'm stuck...
Cousin Yui, do you know this one?
You probably don't!
Don't ask if you don't think I know it.
Didn't you see what just happened?
Man...
Maybe I'll call Miyuki-san.
Might be a bother for her though.
Well...
It'll probably be a bother.
Since it's late.
Why does she never...
...turn to her dad in these situations?
Rely on me sometimes!
I'll fix ya real good!
Izumi.
Don't sleep in class.
We live in an age where corporal punishment isn't allowed...
...yet you often hit people like it's no big deal.
Not that I have a problem with it.
That's true.
But I don't hit just anybody.
I choose my targets very carefully, if you get my drift.
Else I could get in trouble.
She actually said it.
Another crazy thing about her.
Besides, it doesn't make sense to ban corporal punishment.
「His life is the story of our era's most perfect man」
Jean-Paul Sartre
John Lennon
「Coolest man in the world」

「Shoot, coward...
You are only going
to kill a man」
Okay.
That's all for today.
Miyuki-san, sorry.
I don't know these era names.
Yuki-chan.
Teach me how to do this one.
Yeah...
So like...
...why don't you ever ask your teacher?!
Ms. Kuroi!
Izumi, what's up?
Well...
I had a question...
Oh.
Ask away then.
I can't really refuse.
There's this rare item in a game I'm playing right now...
Er, what?!
Teacher?!
No...
That's not what I meant...
It's always sweltering after a typhoon.
We had quite a few instances of good weather after a storm.
Like they say, stormy weather flock together.
Not bad.
By the way, what wasn't bad?
Just to make sure...
...that was supposed to be a joke, right?
Um...
I wanted to ask you something...
What's up this time?
About this morning...
Did Kona-chan say something weird?
I couldn't tell what was wrong...
We watch the news and stuff together...
...so why is she at Konata's level?
Notice for
Absent Resident
Why do you people always have such perfect timing...?
The pitcher is keeping an eye on the runner on second.
How's the baseball game going?
At this rate, it'll probably go overtime.
Again?!
Sheesh.
I have to change the recording time on the VCR.
Good grief.
They could just give it a bigger time block to begin with.
Besides...
...everybody drags out their motions in pro baseball, right?
Wouldn't they be able to finish on time...
...if they did everything at a brisker pace?
Well...
Some fans like the game because of the pace...
And the players need to concentrate.
Well?
Are you used to school yet?
Yes.
But I'm having a hard time with the huge homework load.
I see.
Third-years focus on studying for college testing...
...so they don't have much homework, huh?
Konata...
You...
Huh...
What's she talking about?
Too hot...
Bellybutton showing!
Konata!
How can you walk around dressed like that?!
What if Yu-chan copies you?!
But it's so hot lately.
You know...
It's like that thing the Diet's doing.
Cool Biz?
Yeah, that!
No, that's something different.
What were you doing?
I was wondering if I'd gotten a reply yet.
Don't you get anxious?
I was reading and I missed my stop.
Your casual slip-ups are always so cute.
Really?
Pretty sure they just cause trouble.
You have no idea.
The way she's all embarrassed when
she tries to make up for the mistake is so moe.
It's cuter when you have some kind of shortcoming.
What?
So at your job...
I spilled it!
I'm so sorry, sir!
You do stuff like that?
Kagami.
You seem kinda dumb.
What're you doing?
You're the one who started talking about it!
Though I was the one who acted it out...
So what?
Do you pretend to be clumsy...
...to score points with the customers?
I don't do anything like that.
It's a common stereotype...
...but you'll get in trouble with the manager.
Oh.
I figured you'd be like, "It's moe," and do it all the time.
You have no idea, Kagami.
Clumsy girls may be cute and moe...
...but it's pretty annoying when they cause trouble in real life.
Though you can just laugh it off in games.
You otakus can be really harsh sometimes...
If we get a perfect answer...
...courtesy of Look JT*...
...we have a one-month journey through the tundra for the prize.
Now, let us begin.
On variety shows and quiz shows...
...they always have a bunch of prizes.
I am currently at Earth's bellybutton...
Isn't it to attract more contestants?
Ayers Rock!
And if they get a big-name celebrity, the ratings will go up.
Today's mystery is located in wondrous Australia.
That's true.
Here you will find kangaroos, koalas, and other wild animals.
Well, I don't really know.
But you know...
If they let the audience participate...
...and gave them the prizes...
This continent, separated long ago by tectonic movement...
...wouldn't that boost ratings even more?
...has transformed into a holy land safe from foreign intrusion.
I have to agree...
...but that's a direct way to do business.
Morning!
Yo.
I was playing a game yesterday when I realized something...
Who's our school idol?
What is this school idol?
Like a "Miss" contest or something?
Yeah...
That's what you would think...
It's more theoretical in games...
With stuff like personal bodyguards.
Another exhausting day...
So refreshing!
I have to leave early tomorrow.
Guess I should stay off the Internet tonight...
...and hit the sack.
Don't want to be late.
I'm starting to prioritize sleep...
Is it a sign I'm getting old?
When I was in school, I skipped sleep to have fun...
Ta-Tamura-san...
Is something wrong?
You've been making a lot of faces...
Well...
You know how when you're drawing...
...you tend to make the same faces as your characters?
Really...
So you were drawing.
I didn't know that you drew manga, Tamura-san.
They're mostly doujin...
What kind of manga do you draw?
Um...
Normal stuff like four panels...
O-Or romance stuff with...
...game characters I like...
So hard to answer...
The other day, I won 3,000 yen
with a lottery ticket I randomly bought.
I was thinking how lucky I was that morning.
Amazing!
But then my bicycle tire burst on the
way to school, so I had to pay for repairs.
And my box lunch was ruined, so I had to
buy another one from a convenience store.
The money vanished so perfectly...
My 3,000 yen...
Truth is stranger than fiction...
...I suppose.
But you know...
I figure I can use this story for manga...
...so it's okay...
She's strong...
Th-The drawing hand...
...is an artist's all...
Must defend it with my life...
Sh-She's strong...
You really are skilled.
Nah...
I've been in a slump...
That one's a bust.
But this is probably one of my better recent ones.
Yeah...
Other people aren't going to notice...
...the artist's habits or subtle touches...
I already knew that...
Crap!
What's wrong, Tamura-san?
I left my favorite pencil on my
desk after I finished drawing yesterday.
Want to borrow mine?
No...
I'm no good without her...
It just feels totally different...
Yeah...
Pencils are all the same, right?
I know it's true...
Of course that's how people would react...
So I ended up lost and couldn't get out for three hours.
What's wrong, Tamura-san?
S-So embarrassing...
The hell are they thinking, wearing that in broad daylight?
A coat?
Aren't they hot wearing so much in summer?
So only people who understand can feel the agony...
Hold on.
I need to message someone.
Welcome!
Sure is crowded.
I'll go write my name on the sheet.
So I was up all night playing games with Big Sister Konata.
Suzaku-sama!
Suzaku-sama, party of three!
They called us.
But Tamura-san...
They called a different name.
In these situations...
...I always want to put down the name of my favorite character.
It, like, makes me feel closer to the character.
Haruhi
Kyon
Yuki
Mikuru
Itsuki
Current Bowler: Haruhi
You can find my people...
...everywhere!
Rely on the Nurse's Office
Thanks.
I wish I could be all slender...
...and tall like you, Iwasaki-san.
Fantasy
I admire you so much, Minami-chan.
So...
Yutaka...
Rely on the Nurse's Office
Reality
You'll still grow.
Perhaps...
...you'll grow even taller than me.
Taller than you?
Fantasy
Minami-chan!
Minami-chan!
Minami-chan...
No!
That goes against natural world order!
And the last one's totally off!
Calm down, girl!
Tamura-san, are you okay?
You look kinda pale.
Actually...
...today's the submission deadline for an upcoming event...
...and I was up all night finishing...
I just sent it out...
But when I look at how hard I can work on something...
...I feel like I'm shining.
She's strong...
Tamura-san!
What's yaoi?
Which definition are you looking for...
Good lucky!
We're already on the nineteenth episode of Lucky Channel!
Looks like we're finally in the home stretch!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
And I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi!
It's a pleasure.
Net Darling!
Anyway...
Da-Da Darling!
Akira-sama appears to be in a good mood today.
Can't do anything about adult circumstances.
Did something good happen?
What do you think?
Uh...
N-Never mind...
Being on TV really puts a strain on my nerves.
The stress really builds up after nineteen episodes.
I wish I could just soak in a spa and recuperate.
Maybe I can win that prize they
were talking about in the actual show.
That's like!
In that case...
...you have to start by appearing in the quiz show, right?
Crap...
Oh, yeah!
Traveling is great!
I'd love to travel!
Going someplace you've never been...
...really lightens your mood!
It rules!
Do you like to travel?
But of course!
I love to!
I've actually been to many places!
I've climbed Mt. Takao!
And I've been to Jogashima!
I'm definitely the outdoors type!
So you like to travel.
When you want to calm yourself down these days...
...nothing can beat a stroll through the splendor of a pristine forest!
Sounds great...
A stroll through a pristine forest.
Must really calm the soul.
Right?
Away from the hustle and bustle of the city...
...surrendering yourself to the tranquility of nature...
It heals both the body and soul!
Sounds good.
Nature might be nice.
Isn't nature great?!
Wanna go on a walk through the forest?
Seriously?!
Can I?
Well, if I can...
...I will!
Okay.
Thanks!
Then Minoru's Nature Tour's a go.
Huge.
Take 'em.
Guess they'll come in handy...
Where...
...am I going...
...exactly...?
Mt. Fuji.
But...
I've already been to the mountains...
Not the mountain.
The forest.
Go to the forests of Fuji.
The forests, huh?
Who is...
I am...
Uh...
What am I supposed to do there?
Bring me water.
Water?
I wanna drink some of that famous Fuji water...
...so go get me some.
No way!
Don't they sell that stuff at convenience stores?!
I want mine fresh!
I won't be alone, right?
Alone!
Alone?!
Someone's coming with me, right?!
Don't worry.
The director and producer are sacrificing themselves to go with you.
Lucky you.
Oh, my saviour!
Come on!
Stop wasting time!
Don't miss the deadline.
No!
Please let me go!
We're already out of time!
Everybody!
Then...
I'll do it myself!
We'll have a wonderful guest next time...
Stop!
Please stop!
...here on Lucky Channel!
You can expect something great!
Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Bye-bee!
Let go of me!
Did we really need to go through all this trouble to get rid of him?
Could have just...
This week, we would like you to enjoy the pleasant image of nature and two young women playing with bubbles.
Part of my body is hot! Hot!
Hello!
Minoru Shiraishi here!
Now, please listen to me!
How a Man Should Live!
I wanna be like him.
Also, please feel free to turn off the sound.
Always looking ahead and moving forward.
Once you've made up your mind...
...never stop.
Once you've grabbed on...
...never let go.
Body and soul are...
...bare naked.
Body and soul are...
...bare.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Nanako.
I'm Yui-chan!
I've been thinkin'...
Summer's like...
You get all excited before it starts...
...but before you know it, it's over and nothing happened, right?
Well, I guess nothing special ever happens.
Besides, you're not gonna have a long
relationship with anybody you meet during fling season.
I wouldn't know...
Well, we've still got time.
Let's both work hard.
Yes?
Hard to answer...

You've been messing around there for a while...
...but can you even tell?
Aren't they all the same?
Isn't it common sense to do this?
Otherwise, you could spend all the money
in the world and never get what you want.
Your common sense has very little practical application.
At the very least, normal people wouldn't do it.
How
to
Spend
Summer
It isn't just about figures...
Some people are after the cards.
How can you distinguish between cards?
Don't they all weigh the same?
There have been many legends and rumors about this.
Like where to find good cards...
Or special marks or patterns to look for.
By the way, I can usually get the special cards I want.
There's a pattern to it...
...if the box was just opened.
That's pretty insane if you think about it...
...but I really don't feel like praising her!
If people know these things...
...don't the good ones get taken in no time?
That's true...
If you live in an area with experts...
...rare cards and secret figures are gone in a flash.
When I go to a shop and see all these gaps in a box...
...I'm left in despair.
But then I end up falling for that faint glimmer of hope.
It's such a problem.
You definitely have a problematic nature.
I heard some collectors...
...go out and buy a whole bunch at once?
Yeah.
Some do.
It's faster to complete a set if you buy a bunch at once...
...and it's easier to read distribution patterns that way.
Oh, really.
Well, they call it the adult purchasing
method since it's a strain on your budget.
Gotta work part-time to support it.
Adult purchasing method, huh...
They might call it an adult method...
...but they sure act immature.
It signifies a really possessive nature...
...or selfish behavior.
Maybe the young adult purchasing method would be better.
Am I the only one who thinks that
spending the effort on something else...
...would be more meaningful?
These days...
Akihabara gets a lot more media attention.
And they're obnoxious about it.
They can do stories if they want...
...but I have yet to see anything based on factual evidence.
Well, they probably exaggerate some stuff...
...but isn't that because of their audience?
But that doesn't explain how TV shows and songs...
...which were big in otaku culture first became popular.
News programs and variety shows
use anime and game music all the time.
Well...
Maybe that's because normal people wouldn't recognize it?
Speaking of otakus...
Male otakus...
...are always talking about how they want an
otaku with the same interests for a girlfriend...
...on forums and stuff.
But you never hear a female otaku
wanting to go out with another otaku.
I wonder why.
Maybe girls are more susceptible to the charms of 2-D.
Maybe they're worried about the future?
I'm sure most of them are working though...
And like, don't ask me this stuff.
They showed up as soon as it got hot.
Can't stand how they're noisy and quick to escape.
And they're dirty.
They say that Musashi Miyamoto...
...could catch flies using chopsticks.
For real?!
I can't believe he was willing to
touch those things with eating utensils.
Makes me sick.
That's your concern?
Well, I know what you mean...
Abeshi!
Wow!
I could never smack a mosquito.
Why's that?
It'd be all gross when blood got
over your hand when you crushed it.
That's true...
That's my blood.
But what if a mosquito lands on your arm?
I go, "Shoo! Shoo!"
Or I blow on it.
Did you know?
If you clench your arm when a mosquito lands on it...
...it can't pull its stinger out.
No way!
Just watch.
You are already dead.
You've already been bitten.
If you clench even harder...
...the mosquito will explode.
Stop! Stop!
It itches!
Should have just smacked it in the first place.
Itches so much!
Are you going overseas again this summer, Miyuki-san?
No.
Not this year.
However...
...we will probably visit relatives in the country.
I also often go to the summer festival
with the neighbor's daughter from Ryouou.
She's like a younger sister.
So you're going to a summer festival, Iwasaki-san.
You'd probably look great in a yukata.
Not at all...
I know that you're complimenting me...
...but for some reason, I can't appreciate it.
It's like you're saying I don't have any...
Izumi
Be right there...
Yo...
Morning...
You just woke up?!
What a slob.
Well...
Something's really been bothering me lately.
What?
Like, did my alarm clock ring?
Or like, did somebody else turn it off?
I know what you mean!
When you look, the switch is off.
But then again, it gets hot in the afternoon...
...so I can't really keep sleeping.
We're well into the afternoon.
Kona-chan.
It's morning.
Wake up.
Izumi-kun.
Let's eat lunch together.
I thought I might go home with you, Konata-kun.
Hey, Konata.
Why are the main characters in those games...
...so unconditionally popular?
Beats me...
Maybe 'cause it wouldn't be a game otherwise?
Geez!
You have to do your homework!
I-It's not like I'm worried or anything.
Fine.
I'll do it if you say so.
Hey, Konata.
Why are the heroines in those games...
...always cute with great personalities yet unattached?
You can just pick and choose.
Beats me...
Maybe 'cause it wouldn't be a game otherwise?
Yo, Konata!
I'm here to play!
While checking on Yutaka.
Good evening, Cousin Yui.
Konata?
Your father's calling for you.
Okay.
Yutaka started on her homework, so let me borrow some manga.
Er...
Don't you need to study, Konata?
Haven't you been playing this whole time?
No!
You've got it wrong!
You just have bad timing and enter whenever I'm taking a break!
GRIN
But that just means you take a lot of breaks.
And so...
...I'm concerned about my image at home...
I try to stay at my desk...
...but I end up taking a break.
Honestly...
It's because you usually don't work hard.
But well...
It's not like I don't understand how you feel.
You've had a similar experience?
Well...
If I pick up a book I really want to read during a break...
...I end up wanting to take another
break as soon as I start studying again.
It's hard to put those down in the middle.
It's the same with manga.
You say you'll stop after one more volume...
...but then you end up reading dozens more.
When you borrow the DVDs for a TV series you missed...
...you always have to watch one more episode.
But the follow-up tends to be trash.
I see.
Director, about this doll...
Big Sister.
Can I change the channel?
Sure.
I wasn't really watching.
Is there something you want to watch?
There's going to be a special on sweets from around the country.
You love sweets, right?
I bet Kagami and Tsukasa will watch, too.
It's like the Hare Hare Dance of sweets!
That looks great!
With these shows...
...even if you find something good...
...it ends up being sold somewhere far
away and you're left disappointed, right?
We live in Saitama, so Nagoya's kinda...
That always happens...
...but I still end up watching.
Too bad.
Summer Classes ————
Good morning, Yuki-chan.
Um, what's wrong?
I went to the dentist's yesterday.
You're still going?
I ran away halfway through...
Let me know if it hurts.
It'll be over soon.
Something like that...
That's right!
They never stop!
It hurts to just hear about it!
We already have summer classes...
...but homework on top of that?
Screw that.
It's summer vacation.
It's not like you do it yourself anyway.
Besides...
...unlike grade school and middle school...
...we don't have independent projects or book reports.
Isn't this easier?
You just have to answer questions.
We made crafts and posters, too.
With that stuff...
...you end up getting your parents' help.
And then they get so into it that they finish it, right?
I won a prize off of that once.
With a poster or something.
I remember that.
I was like, "It's all thanks to you, Dad.
I think you're even cooler now!"
And Dad was all happy about it.
Shouldn't a parent be mad about that?
Buy at least five at once!
Whenever I see this commercial...
...I always get jealous.
When I was little...
...and read that fairy tale about a gingerbread house...
...I wanted to try eating all the candy I could!
I know what you mean...
...but when you actually get a lot of what you want...
...you tend to lose interest.
Really...
Yeah.
It stinks the whole year.
So I was thinking...
About summer homework...
I'm always in trouble 'cause I plan
to do it in one go in the latter half.
That came out of nowhere.
And I didn't need you to tell me that.
If I worked at it little by little...
...I might not have to scramble at the end.
You just realized that?
You're a third-year already.
Don't burn yourself out.
Which means I'll be coming over tomorrow so thanks.
I'll bring a present.
So that's what you meant by little by little?
Are you going to come over all summer?
Probably every week.
Shut up!
Yo...
It's hot...
Yo.
Sure is.
The A/C's on in my room.
So comfortable!
You sure are making yourself at home...
It's like this every year.
Summer always passes without me wanting to do anything.
Before I know it, summer vacation's over.
Stop sounding so lazy.
Set milestones this year...
...and get your homework done.
Well...
I plan on working hard before summer vacation begins every year.
Really?
In manga...
You see the whole "I didn't do my homework!" gag used a lot...
...this time of year.
That's true.
When you look at that...
...don't you think that in theory, you don't need to do it?
If that's what everybody else is doing...
Of course not!
Do it.
Besides, if you're gonna be like this, don't come to copy!
I'm thirsty.
I'll go get some barley tea.
Sis!
Sorry...
Could you also get the math problem set from my room?
Pretty please.
Yeah, yeah.
So hot!
You don't want to leave an air conditioned room...
...so you ask someone else to do it when they leave...
...but nobody else wants to leave, huh?
In winter, you don't want to leave the kotatsu...
...so you ask someone else to do stuff for you when they get up.
Hey.
Yo!
Sure is hot.
Yo.
Welcome.
I brought ice cream.
Take whichever one you want.
Since I won't be much help with homework.
And the Marimokkori's eyes...
In these situations...
...why is it that you always want the ones other people chose?
I'm reading this manga about getting into Tokyo U.
That one, huh?
When you read that...
...don't you start thinking that you
might have a chance to get into Tokyo U?
If you work hard like them!
You sure are simple.
Even if that method could get you into Tokyo U...
You'd need friends who abandon their regular classes to join in...
Teachers who hold class like that...
Someone to take charge.
And all kinds of other things for it to work, right?
You're right...
It's not that easy...
Too many people...
...get influenced by manga or TV shows
and think they can change themselves.
Well...
I plan on working hard and studying...
...but I always get sleepy.
Is there a good way to stay awake?
I think it's better to take a little nap...
...than to force yourself to stay awake.
Oh, really?
I heard that before, so I gave it a try...
But my little nap ended up being a lot longer...
...yeah?
No willpower...
Hello!
Hello, Yutaka-chan.
Hello.
Um, do you have a minute?
What's up, Yu-chan?
You can ask us anything.
A friend from middle school apparently got a boyfriend...
...and she asked me what she should give him for his birthday.
I have no idea...
What do I do...
It got really awkward...
A-Anyway, Yu-chan...
They have web sites that discuss this stuff...
...so you should take a look.
There might be a thread about it.
You can use my computer.
I-I'll do that.
I know about Tra** Man...
...but you can even ask questions about this stuff.
It's pretty common these days.
Anything goes, huh?
That's right.
They probably have the answers for math problems, too.
It makes me think how kids these days have it so easy.
As technology and the community advance...
...the users' mindsets and willpower are getting worse.
Just look at her.
Huh?
That's odd...
I'm just copying homework...
...but unlike usual...
...the presence of an audience creates this pride-like feeling...
Oh, yeah.
What about the festival at your place?
What are you talking about?
It's already over.
Wha—
Same as last year.
Why didn't you tell me?!
We have to study for exams.
If we told you, you'd definitely want to go.
We didn't go either.
Doesn't have to be ours...
Just go to the one where you live.
Is it already over?
Where I live...?
Yeah, I wonder when that is...
Yeah...
Some people go to festivals in other places...
...but don't even care about the ones where they live.
Are you the type who avoids friends from back home?
Even college applicants can't go on studying forever.
That's right...
There's going to be a fireworks display near my home tomorrow.
That's it!
Let's all go have fun for once!
Guess so.
We could use a break.
That's right.
There's going to be a fireworks display
near your home tomorrow, Minami-chan.
I'd like to see Japanese fireworks.
Then let's all go together, Minami.
Minami-chan.
Are you free tomorrow?
I'm good.
Then it's decided, Minami.
Let's go, Iwasaki-san.
Huh?
Iwasaki-san?
It's a pretty famous fireworks display...
...Mi—
Iwasaki-san.
It's hard to change how you call
someone once you've gotten used to it.
But it's far away and famous, so it'll be crowded, right?
Will you be okay, Yu-chan?
Weren't you sick a while back?
It's going to be hot tomorrow so should we wait for the next one?
You don't have to worry about me.
It happens all the time.
I'm the class health officer, and I'll be coming...
...so it'll be okay...
...Yutaka.
That's right.
You're right.
Thanks, Minami-chan!
So we're going to see fireworks...
...but otherwise, it's college application and study time.
It sucks how I have less time to play.
'Cause Kagami and the others are all serious.
Well, I can understand.
You should just do what you want.
I used to drag Kanata around...
...and made lots of memories.
I got in trouble...
...but adolescence doesn't wait!
Then maybe I should get a boyfriend and make some memories.
Absolutely not!
I won't accept a boyfriend!
Well, Dad...
You're not making sense.
That's right.
Wanna come watch fireworks with us, Yu-chan?
Actually, I'm also going.
We're meeting up at Minami-chan's place.
Really...
We're leaving!
Have fun!
The train's here!
You're late.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Yutaka-chan came along.
Um...
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Over here!
Hello.
Hey.
Hiya.
Patricia-san.
Are you also here for the fireworks?
You look good in a yukata.
What the heck?!
Iwasaki
Huh?
So Miyuki-san's neighbor was Minami-chan.
What a coincidence.
What a surprise.
Welcome.
Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Oh?
Not enough?
There should be enough...
Mom.
Did you count yourself?
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
My.
You're right.
Now I get it.
Thanks for having us!
So this is Minami-chan's house.
Scary big dog...
Don't worry.
It doesn't bark.
And it's really friendly.
I see.
When they're big and friendly...
...it's actually kinda cute.
Huh?
It's growling at me...
Maybe she's the type who tends to get barked at.
When I was little...
...I would wonder if fireworks were still round from the side.
Huh?
So they don't look flat?
Hey now...
They show firework displays on TV occassionally...
...but there's a better atmosphere when you watch the real thing.
You're right.
But you know...
I've been thinking...
Every time they launch a big one...
...and announce that this was
sponsored by some business or other...
...doesn't that ruin the mood?
Th-That's true.
Huh?
Yu-chan.
You look a little pale.
I'm okay.
It's okay...
...so go watch.
But...
I'll...
...stay here.
Minami-chan.
That was wonderful.
Yeah.
This is what summer's all about.
But you know...
It never ends up being a beautiful memory like in manga.
I got bitten everywhere.
So itchy!
They say that it itches more if you scratch.
And when you take off the yukata, it itches under the belt.
That's right.
Beautiful.
It really was.
But sorry for causing you trouble.
There you are.
Hey.
Were you guys bitten by bugs, too?
We weren't bitten at all.
So some people are easily bitten and some aren't.
So lucky.
Nah.
Maybe the mosquitos read the mood.
Good lucky!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
I'm the assistant...
Daisuke Ono.
We're already on the twentieth episode of Lucky Channel!
You're not a crow today.
You're not a dog today.
Then let's have a look at the live feed.
Forest
Studio
I wonder where he is right now.
That Shiroishi-kun.
Mt. Fuji's so pretty!
Whatever.
Then bye-bee!
Bye-bee!
Shiraishi-kun?
Shiraishi-kun?!
Ma'am!
This is what you wanted, right?
Hello, Minoru Shiraishi here!
Now, please listen to me!
Bridegroom Rumba!
One, two, three, four!
Merry voices ring through the air...
...at a church in June.
The phrase "happiest moment of my life" was...
...made for such a time.
If I'd known this would happen...
...I wouldn't have bought that new house.
Getting jilted by the bride...
...is like something out of manga.
All worked up, I break into the Bridegroom Rumba.
Somebody save me.
Oh, my god!
What am I going to do now?!
Even my boss is here!
One, two, three! Two, Two, three!
Bridegroom Rumba!
Cha-la!
Cha-la-la!
Cha!
Cha!
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
Misao here.
Ayano here.
Hey, Ayano.
Isn't Hiiragi so heartless?
She always runs off to the midget's class.
There, there.
Does our love not reach Hiiragi?!

Morning, you two.
Yo.
Good morning.
You remembered to wear your winter uniform.
Come on...
It's not like I'm Tsukasa.
What?!
But the hot weather isn't over yet...
They could let us wear our summer uniforms a little longer.
And when we have to wear
summer uniforms, it gets cold sometimes...
They should just let us choose.
Right?
The switch is more to give students a change in pace.
Else there would be more slackers like you two.
Pandora's
Box
This doesn't happen in our family...
...but I've heard that some parents monitor...
...their daughters' cell phones and e-mail.
I've heard of that on occasion.
Is it like that for you?
Probably not.
Your dad's the type to smother...
...but I guess he wouldn't do anything you wouldn't like.
That might be part of it...
My dad also uses the computer.
Maybe it's 'cause he knows how
embarrassing it is when someone else looks at your D drive.
D...
What?
We've had all these classes and stuff this summer...
In the end...
I only got to have fun with the fireworks and Ariake.
So you still go to Comiket.
Comiket?!
Well, you know...
As a result, my wallet's feeling pretty lonely.
How much did you spend?
You never know when to draw the line.
If you assume each book is a thousand yen...
Around forty to fifty thousand yen total?
Why you...
There's a limit to how clueless a
person can be about the value of money!
Still, Kagami...
There's this thing called market price.
And it's pretty expensive to publish your own stuff.
That's not what I meant!
I'm talking about how you don't
feel anything after spending so much!
It may be September...
...but it's still hot.
That's right.
It seems especially hot this year.
And there's talk about global warming.
Yu-chan can't put up with too much heat...
...so she's been resting in an air-conditioned room most of the time.
That's what Tsukasa's been doing the whole time.
But she's just lazy.
Well...
Dad and I join in...
...and we all lie around looking like a 小 character.
小?
Shouldn't it be 川?
Nah.
Dad's always in the middle.
Your family never changes.
And I guess Yutaka-chan's gotten used to it.
Hey, hey!
Doing good, Yutaka?
I'm here to play!
Sis!
Oh?
Who's this?
My friend...
Minami Iwasaki-chan.
So this is the Minami-chan Yutaka's always talking about.
S-Sis!
So she has a reason for hope right next to her...
I'm a little jealous.
Man...
I'd heard all the fuss...
...but you sure are pretty.
You wowed me!
Want something to drink?
Beer then!
Huh?!
Didn't you drive here?!
Just kiddin'!
Barley tea's fine!
I see.
One absorbs from the other...
Absorption, is it...?
Oh...
[Yassai Mossai - a Japanese folk dance]
It's the Yassai Mossai?
I always get sleepy at night.
Do you have any good ideas?
Instead of forcing yourself to stay up...
...why don't you wake up early and work on it?
You'll probably feel better.
I see!
You're right!
I'll wake up early and work hard.
Huh?
Why is it the same time I always get up?
Come to think of it...
I vaguely remember turning something off at some point...
Even when I wake up early...
...I just roll over and go back to sleep.
You have no willpower...
Maybe I should just try harder...
...and work on it at night.
I doubt rubbing your eyes while nodding off...
...will improve the results.
Why don't you have someone wake you up?
Mom and the others wake up early.
Right, Mom?
Yes, yes.
I'll wake you up.
This can't fail.
Sis is amazing.
Mom!
I told you to wake me up!
I did.
You even answered me back.
I don't know anything about that.
You don't remember?
Big Sister forgot her lunch...
Thanks!
It feels kind of weird to walk
through the hallway of a different grade.
You can feel a little pressure...
I know what you mean.
Yu-chan probably drew everybody's attention.
Being the way she is...
Usually, it's just your imagination...
...but when you walk through
upperclassmen or underclassmen hallways...
...you get this feeling that everybody's looking at you, right?
I already tend to stand out 'cause I'm smaller...
...but when it's because they're
upperclassmen, the pressure is more intense.
I enjoy receiving that kind of attention.
Really...
But I don't attract much attention when I'm in the first-year's area.
They don't realize I'm an upperclassman.
Holds no power as an upperclassman.
Patty-chan.
Hi!
Hello there.
Are you heading to work?
That's right.
I signed up for too many shifts this week.
Aren't you still working?
That's right.
We're pretty popular.
The A-boys are all over us.
A-boys?
It's what you call boys who look like they totally belong in Akiba.
But Narimiya-kun was a little different.
You're getting accustomed to Japan.
A little too accustomed, don't you think?
I just had a great idea!
I'll write it down once I'm done with my bath.
H-Huh?
I can't remember...
This is what happens when I don't jot it down immediately...
And it was funny...
Hilarious, even!
Another exhausting day...
That might be a funny idea.
I'll write it down when I wake up tomorrow.
Er...
That's weird...
What was it again?
I'm positive it was a good idea.
Should have just gotten out of bed and written it down.
Man!
I even got out of bed this time!
Why do you forget dreams so quickly?
I'm positive that it was hilarious!
School Trip
Kyoto & Nara
So...
Make sure you all talk it over within your group.
Kyoto ・ Nara
Since we're going all the way to Kyoto and Nara...
...you better check up on all the hot tourist spots.
Aren't we going through all the hot spots by bus?
Those will just be the typical places...
...so they won't be that fun.
Well now...
That's a blunt way to put it...
So Iris came in here...
I will now guide you through the former capital of Nara.
Almost 1,300 years have passed since it became the capital in 710.
While in Nara...
...I hope you enjoy my historical Nara narration.
Nara!
Nara narration!
Were we supposed to laugh?
Sorry for the wait!
This is the main body...
So the little things around it are options!
You're gonna get hit by lightning.
No!
I'm all sticky...
And stinky...
I'm all stinky now!
Here, here, here.
Indeed.
What's that supposed to mean?
Please, please.
They probably want you to take their picture.
Um... Um...
Click. Click.
Okay?
This is when you can tell how much somebody's been studying.
Like you're one to talk.
Um...
Sis.
How do you say "cheese" in Indian?
You mean Hindi, right?
Um...
Uh...
Genius girl Kagami can't do any better.
Um...
I believe that Indians will understand English.
That's right!
"Say cheese!" should be fine, yeah?
Okay.
Say cheese!
You know how...
...couples pop out of nowhere during school trips?
Can't miss the school trip event.
Perhaps...
...being away from school...
...gives people a sense of freedom?
Kinda like a now or never thing.
I'm embarrassed to say that...
...I'm unable to sleep with a different pillow.
I'm embarrassed to say that...
...I can't sleep peacefully without this nearby.
I'm embarrassed to say that...
...I can't sleep if I haven't turned
this on at least once during the day.
Everyone.
The bus will soon pass Kiyomizu Temple.
The hill leading to Kiyomizu Temple...
...is known as Three-year Hill.
Legend says that...
...if you trip and fall here, you'll die in three years.
Three-year Hill will become...
...your Boo-hoo Hill.
Does it count if you break down laughing?
Okay?
We'll be moving around in individual groups now.
Keep an eye out for traffic.
We'll regroup at 12:30 in front of Chion-in.
Don't be late.
Anybody who's late gets to write a
happy 20-page report when we get back.
Sure about that?
Let's give it a try.
The Dragon Slayer's probably about this heavy.
We're really high up.
You know how the saying goes,
"Like you're going to jump off Kiyomizu..."
...but if you really jumped, wouldn't you die?
Does it mean that you no longer care what happens?
You're so pragmatic, Kagami.
Look, look!
It says marriage.
This place seems to be famous for its god of marriage.
They really spell it out for you.
Look.
You can draw love fortunes.
Let's all give it a try.
Let's do it!
Guess I can't tell these apart...
Isn't that obvious?
This one!
Great fortune!
Lucky you, Kona-chan.
My.
I drew good fortune.
That's fine.
Now what did I get...
Half fortune?
What's this?
I-I guess you only get half a fortune.
Which means it's half bad.
Not like I care about love fortunes.
So cute!
That looks nice.
Nah.
Kagami would want this.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'll get one of these.
Kagami! Kagami!
You forgot this!
I'm not buying it!
Then what about this?
No!
You should be careful.
Marriage Wishes
This one says, "Konata is my wife."
Okay.
Everyone's here, right?
We'll have lunch after we've gone in the hotel.
Let's get going.
Take us there, please.
They said that Koizumi's character
song was written in an IZAM style.
Teacher!
Someone's chasing us from behind!
What?!
This is like the Hokkaido shoot all over again!
Don't ditch me!
You have to go, "***tel!"
That idiot.
He's getting assigned a 50-page report!
Driver!
Sorry, could you stop for a second?
See you later.
Hiiragi
I'd like to talk.
Please meet me in
front of the hotel
at 9pm.
-From a certain boy
Doesn't even hurt!
The Golden Pavilion Temple is golden...
...but the Silver Pavilion Temple isn't silver, huh?
They wanted to group it with the Golden Pavilion Temple...
Click.
...so they named it silver to go along with golden.
Click.
It was never silver to begin with.
Click.
I wonder if it's like Poke***...
With Sapphire and Ruby and stuff.
No comment?
Our family's shrine was on the news.
We only have one day left.
Our plan for free time is all set.
Tomorrow is the beginning of our true school trip!
Off we go to the holy land!
Right...
D-Does this count as being in front of the hotel?
Did you wait long?
So...
What did you want to talk about?
You're the only person I can talk to about this.
Please give me that doll!
Doll?
You know...
The one you bought from the Kiyomizu Temple souvenir shop!
The Yatsuhashi character.
Ya-Yatsuhashi-kun?
Yeah!
That one!
I really liked it and wanted one.
But if someone saw me buying one...
...they'd probably all make fun of me!
I'm begging you!
Thank you!
I'm eternally in your debt!
Don't tell anybody about this!
Yes, yes.
I'm reading this book about four brothers.
****** of the Dragon Kings?
I can't take it off!
That's right.
Come to think of it...
That could make a pretty good anime.
The steam within cooled off...
...and formed a vacuum.
They did an anime adaptation a while back.
If you press on the sides a little...
Really?
...that should allow air to enter and make the lid easier to remove.
I had no idea!
I think they went up to the fourth volume of the original.
In that case...
But those books are...
I'm sorry!
So sorry!
Putting on a show till the very end.
I've already looked up the directions.
Is it really okay for us to visit?
We'll just be looking from the outside, so it's okay.
There's no need to go that far just 'cause we're in Kyoto.
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
You don't understand an otaku's idea of romance.
I don't want to.
Not much here.
It makes it easier to concentrate on their job, so this works.
It's a pretty ordinary-looking building.
They limit their workload, so this works.
Was it really necessary to buy these in Kyoto?
That's embarrassing!
Who cares?
It's a little something for remembering this day!
Sis!
Let's take a picture together!
It's for commemorating this trip.
Since we came all the way to Kyoto.
What does this have to do with Kyoto?
Tsukasa and I made it back in one piece.
Tsukasa's already asleep, though.
I figured you'd be sulking in bed.
Why would I be doing that?
Did you put up the sticker photo?
How could I put up something so embarrassing?
Something so embarrassing....
The school trip was this week...
I sure worked hard.
Okay.
Time to spend the weekend gaming online for once.
Emergency Maintenance Notice
Due to an unexplained server error
at 8:30 PM, the server is currently
undergoing emergency maintenance.
Good lucky!
Here's another crazy episode of Lucky Channel!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
I'm the assistant...
Daisuke Ono.
Lucky Channel is already on the twenty-first episode!
That's right.
We're finally getting close to the end.
Well, then...
Let's get straight to this corner...
This week's...
Bend!
Who is it?
What?
I brought your water.
What is this?!
It's warm!
How am I supposed to drink this?!
I'd rather have something out of a vending machine.
Don't mess with me!
You...
Why, you...
What do you think I've had to put up with this whole time?!
All your damn selfish requests one after the next!
Mi-Minoru?
Well, I'm gonna speak my mind today!
Do you know how I felt when I was doing this corner?!
I'd have to work at CoCo**** every day!
That's better pay than my voice acting work!
Thanks to you, I'm working full-time now!
Before I come kiss your ass here...
...I'm over there frying cutlets!
Which means you're more suited for that work.
And what the hell?!
Why are you sitting there, Ono boy?!
That's my seat!
You were abandoned.
By the director and the producer.
What's that?!
They acted too quickly!
I'm a late bloomer!
I can go from here to Starga**r in no time!
You can?
Really?
Sittin' there making fun of me...
Screw working with Hine**su...
Or Lo** and Be***...
I quit.
I quit this stupid show, damn it!
Take that!
Who gives a damn about Lucky Channel?!
Shiraishi Minoru-san!
What are you doing, morons?!
What are you filming there?!
What's with the Cape of Thirty Years?!
If you wanna play with that...
...I'm gonna be thirty soon!
I'm talking about you...
Welcome to Idaho!
The belt isn't long enough, so she's holding it up from behind.
Hello.
Minoru Shiraishi here!
Yeah.
Okay!
Now please listen!
Don't wanna hear it.
The Dentistman Song!
What is this?
The sound of my drill rings through the universe!
What does that even mean?
Yeah, yeah.
Any enemy will fall after one hit!
Stop moving.
Right.
Striving to protect everyone's dreams...
Stop moving!
I head forth giving my all!
Wait, Akira-san!
Th-The enemy is the cavity monster from hell!
Sheesh.
Right.
I'll show you my Drill of Justice!
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now is the time!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Eliminate them!
T-twin drill!
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Stop moving!
Shatter them!
Eradicate them!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
For I am...
I am...
I am Dentistman!
Can I let go?
Dentistman is...
Dentistman is...
Don't screw up your lines!
...is a cyborg.
He...
He will...
You can't be a hero like that.
...continue fighting to defeat the evil cavities!
You can't fight like that.
How was it?
No good.
Redo.
Yes, ma'am.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Akira Kogami!
I'm Daisuke Ono.
Okay.
That's it for the animal talk.
That was in animal, huh?
Next time:
「There Over Here」

Thanks for treating us today, Cousin Yui!
Anytime!
Don't mention it!
That was good, right?
Right?
Don't you feel happy when the egg tastes good?
The price of gas went up two yen since yesterday...
Should've filled up the tank...
Why is it that people who spend generously...
...care so much about a one yen difference in the price of gasoline?
There
Over
Here
That's right...
That book I lent you a while ago is
apparently getting turned into a game.
I won't be buying it though.
You're so behind, Kagami.
I reserved the limited edition as soon as it was announced.
I even bought the DVD box set for
the anime and other related goods.
You're more hooked than I am.
It's pretty common for people to become bigger
fans than the people who recommend stuff to them.
That's how Cousin Yui chose her car.
Thanks to someone else's influence.
Her car?!
I lent her a racing manga...
That sure surprised me.
It's scary how much energy people put into their hobbies...
Yesterday was the third win in a row, right?
It's the start of a miracle!
If they keep on winning...
What are they talking about?
...the playoffs and Japan Series aren't out of the question.
Probably pro baseball, I believe.
All the way to the top!
Teacher enjoys it.
Besides, baseball's all about...
Speaking of baseball...
The famous poet, Shiki Masaoka...
...apparently loved baseball a great deal.
He played catcher...
...until he was too ill.
And he took his childhood name, Noboru...
...wrote it using the characters for baseball...
...and pronounced it Noball.
By the way...
The winners of the Major League
are called the world champions, right?
Talking about the Japan Series reminded me.
That's right.
Even when it only includes American teams.
Well, they should beat our team before
they call themselves world champions, right?
She's awfully pumped up...
It sure stinks.
It sure does.
There you are!
Kagami!
Miyuki-san!
Konata.
Teach me how to do these!
This is unusual.
You asking a question about schoolwork.
Some of these problems are quite difficult.
That's cause they're from an arcade quiz game.
I'm not good with academic stuff.
There you go again...
And put more effort into your studying.
You're applying for college.
I may be like this here...
...but they call me a sage over there!
In that case...
...just enroll in that whatever academy of yours.
Which is why I didn't get enough sleep.
How long were you up playing?
You say you're always in bed by eleven, Miyuki-san?
That's early.
Wait.
Now I get it...
「Sleeping helps
you grow ☆」
So I was thinking when I looked at Miyuki-san...
...but you haven't grown much considering how much you sleep.
That's what Big Sister said.
I'm really sensitive about that.
That night, around 9 o'clock
Excuse me for calling so late.
My name is Kobayakawa.
Is this the Iwasaki residence?
Thank you.
May I speak with Minami-chan?
She already went to bed?
Did she always sleep this early?
Pittan.
La-la moji pittan.
You're having fun singing.
Yes, we'll make do.
It's okay.
Yes.
I'll let my father know.
After the ground-breaking ceremony.
That's right.
No, of course not!
Please, there you go again...
I'm underage, really.
You've got it wrong!
It's not like that!
Then bye.
Yes.
Yes!
You know, Kagami...
They can't see you gesturing.
I know that!
It's just a force of habit!
Oh, yeah...
When I'm on the phone, I have to concentrate, so I stop gaming...
...but then my empty hand starts feeling lonely...
I know what you mean.
So the other day...
...I was using a roller to get rid of dust the whole time.
Roll! Roll!
Stuff like that can get pretty addictive.
Like random doodling or menial chores.
But you know...
Once you get off the phone, that stuff gets old really fast.
It's kinda depressing when only the area around you is clean.
You could just finish the job.
My passion fades with the conversation.
So you just leave it like that?
That guy's kinda stinky, yeah?
I guess it's okay every now and then.
Look!
**cky!
Po***!
I used to do that...
...back in grade school.
Seriously...
Are you a little kid?
But...
Speaking of things we did when we were little...
...I used to stir my yogurt...
...and go, "Bread factory!"
Bread factory?
Haven't heard of it?
Hey, what was that just now?
Bread factory?
Don't be embarrassed. Just 'fess up.
Shut up!
About that game I lent you back during first semester...
Someone else wants to play it.
So give it back.
Gotcha.
Is it for the squirt?
Reminds me...
I've lent a bunch to her.
I should get them back.
But you sure are amazing, Hiiragi.
What do you mean?
Well...
The other day, I found these games and
didn't remember who I borrowed them from...
I'm impressed you can remember.
Hey now...
And there are some I lent to other people that I've forgotten about.
You're way too careless.
Nah.
There's gotta be a Law of Equal Lending.
It's a universal principle.
As if...
Yes?
Hello?
Hiiragi?
It's me.
Misao.
Yeah, what's u—
Damn...
Not bad, Potemkin...
Wh-What?
Is something wrong?
Nah.
No big deal...
Sorry, sorry.
So?
What do you want?
Well...
What was it again?
I wouldn't know.
It was something super important...
Don't forget it if it's important.
I was looking at the numbers for the Autumn Jumbo Lottery...
...but mine were all off.
Guess it's not so easy to win.
I sent in a bunch of postcards...
...but I didn't win any prizes from the drawing.
Really...
That's too bad...
When you never win...
...you start to wonder if the vendors or
editors are running some kind of scam, right?
Konata!
You shouldn't be so suspicious of other people!
No good...
I'm gonna call it a night.
I'll go to the bathroom first.
They tell me that I talk to myself too much...
But that doesn't matter.
I was really sleepy...
...so why am I so awake after that weird joke?
Next day, dead of night
I really can't do this at night.
I'm not feeling it tonight...
I should get to bed while I'm dozing off.
It's freezing!
I was really sleepy...
...so why am I so awake just 'cause it's cold under the covers?
The day after that, dead of night
It's useless...
It's warm tonight...
Maybe I can fall asleep quickly.
My legs are really hot for some reason...
I can't fall asleep!
Why is that?
Does this only happen to me?
It's the season for baked sweet potatoes!
Well, Kagami...
You know...
Yeah, I know.
I know, so don't say it.
Want some?
Thanks so much.
But you'll gain weight.
You still said it.
But I can't help it!
Once I've made eye contact with the guy...
...it'd be rude not to buy one, right?
You know...
"Will she buy one?"
"My feelings will be hurt if she doesn't."
That look!
I know what you mean.
If you make eye contact at Comiket...
...it's really hard to put a book back.
You don't care when other people have
no idea what you're talking about, huh...
Come on...
I'm talking about when you're hanging around a circle's booth.
When you pick up a book in front of a sales rep...
...you feel pretty bad if you leave without buying it.
But you still put it back, don't you?
There's been an increase in the number
of light novels being adapted to anime.
Looks like it.
The novel I lent you...
...has already had three anime adaptations.
And there should be a new volume coming out soon.
I've watched the anime...
...but I haven't read the novels.
Too much text makes me tired.
That again, huh...
Don't the games you always play have a lot more text?
They should, but it's weird...
It'd really help if they released them in a visual novel format.
Hey!
More importantly...
When are they doing the fourth season of the anime?
Um...
What?
Is that some kind of reference?
Yu-chan...
What are you doing over there?
Th-The lid always ends up crooked.
Well, some people are like that.
I guess it's clumsiness.
I do it all the time.
Here.
You share some cute flaws with Miyuki-san.
Thanks!
You sure are amazing, Big Sister.
What do I do, Big Sister?
Now I can't open it.
Oops.
I used my usual strength.
You sure are a lot of trouble.
You can't open the bag?
Hand it here.
Big Sister!
Thanks!
Huh?
How about we just tear it along the notches?
No!
O-One sec!
I'll open it, so hold on!
Fire...
It's okay.
We can just tear along the notches or use scissors.
No, that would hurt my pride!
Or make me feel like a loser!
Big Sister, is it a mosquito?
Mosquito!
Don't you get annoyed when you know something's there?
Even when you haven't been bitten yet.
Once you know it's there...
...you must take it down!
That's the instinct of a hunter!
I was thinking...
If a guy in the same year professed his love for Yu-chan or me...
...wouldn't that guy be a lolicon?
They're in the same class year...
...so technically, they wouldn't.
But in this case, it feels like appearance holds more weight...
Say, if...
...you were a 30-year-old who
looked like someone in grade school...
Then you could say the guy likes older women...
This is a complicated issue.
It's hard to come up with a strict definition.
You're definitely my dad.
Kagami would have just ended it with, "Who cares?!"
So what about you, Dad?
You fell in love with Mom...
Mom
Daughter
...and you dote on me...
...which means you're a lolicon, right?
No, wait.
Hold it right here.
That's not entirely accurate.
I'm not limited to little girls.
I also like normal girls.
So you should say that I'm also a lolicon.
Well, it basically depends on the character.
Either way, you fail as a human being.
Okay...
You know how you're always so clingy?
Would you still be like that if I were a boy?
Of course!
Okay.
I totally understand now.
Aren't you glad I'm a girl?
Uh...
I think the bath should be ready.
You go first, Yu-chan.
Then excuse me.
He chased her away 'cause he was looking bad.
Hey, Dad.
About Mom...
She was short...
...and your childhood friend...
Isn't she like a character out of a gal game?
Right?
She was adorable since she was little.
I can understand why you fell for her...
...but why did she marry you?
I once said, "You wouldn't accept me...
...so I ended up as a gal game lover!"
And she just said yes...
You're despicable!
But it's the truth.
Isn't that coercion?!
No, no...
That wasn't the only reason, obviously...
And she was really happy when you were born...
Oh.
Doesn't this mole make her look like you, Sou-kun?
Well...
She has your eyes.
You can definitely tell she's our child.
But I hope she doesn't grow up like us.
I hope she doesn't inherit my height...
...or your personality...
Pretty harsh...
But why did you suddenly mention her?
I don't know much about Mom.
Konata.
Are you lonely without Mom around?
Not really.
You create as much excitement as two people would.
And Yu-chan's here.
I see...
Kanata...
Konata's grown up to be a good girl.
a little anime geek
Though she's not as normal as you wanted...
Hey, Konata.
Please don't die before I do.
For now, I have no intention of doing so.
That's good.
Kanata died young...
...but she said she was happy and smiled at the end.
It's hard on those left behind...
...but I want to be like that at the end.
Smiling?
So how do you want to die?
Let's see...
Death by over-arousal?
You're definitely going to have a bizarre death!
That's right...
I bought a digital camera for work today...
I haven't been back in a while.
You're so annoying!
Come on!
I wonder what...
Just one more!
Okay?
Geez! I'm in the middle of a game!
...they're doing right now.
Okay! Okay!
Okay! Cheese!
Come on, Dad!
Okay, one more!
That's enough already.
And Dad, you're way too close.
You're so heartless, Konata.
We're taking photos to commemorate this new camera!
Didn't you buy this for work?
Don't be such a stiff!
Honestly...
Sou-kun hasn't changed.
One more picture!
That's enough.
That's right, you never did...
You're such a pest.
...pay much attention to what other people wanted.
Take that!
Ow.
That hurts, Konata!
You really haven't changed.
But you know...
You feel more and more like Kanata when I hold you.
It makes my heart race.
Hey!
Don't just blurt out risqué statements!
I can see what Mom had to put up with...
What was that?!
Indeed...
Your dad may be like that...
...but don't turn into a bad person.
That's right, Konata.
Teach me that one game once you clear it.
Okay.
That one's surprisingly difficult.
But...
I think I made a wrong choice somewhere...
They play games together...
...so it looks like they're getting along.
I can't make it to the H-scene for the character I want.
Wait!
What are you letting your daughter play?!
Geez...
Is this really okay?
Aren't you teaching her the wrong things, Sou-kun?
Hey.
Why did Mom choose you?
'Cause you're just an old, perverted, lolicon otaku.
People usually don't go for that.
That's a little harsh.
You don't go easy on your old man, huh?
For real.
But that's right...
Honestly...
Kanata had really good intuition.
You were always like this...
Always making me almost forget...
Maybe it was fate.
...why I chose to spend...
Even though I failed as a human being...
...my life with this man.
...there was one thing I was absolutely sure about.
One thing you were absolutely sure about?
What was that?
I was...
...the one who loved Kanata most in this world.
That was it.
I just can't beat you.

Okay!
That's enough reminiscing.
Should we take another one?
We'll do one with Yu-chan later, okay?
The fact that I can no longer be there...
That's enough...
And that would be more than one picture.

It's all good.
You bought this for your hobby, didn't you?
Geez.
What are you talking about?
I'm just testing it out before I take pictures for work.

Man...
If I can live on inside them...

...I'll continue to watch over them.
There!
Here we go!

Okay.

Now that I've talked with her...
...I have a different impression of her...
...but Mina-rin still seems a little scary.
But she's really nice.
She's back!
Minami-chan!
Welcome back!
I'm back.
Those two are really close.
You had classroom duty today, right?
Was the teacher still in the faculty office?
This would be...

Can't find them anywhere?
And you can't find their managers?
They ran away...
Well, either way, they're fired.

I had a bad feeling about this show from the beginning!
U-Uh...
You know?
Fact...
I actually refused in the beginning.
But all that politics crap.
Grown-up issues and whatnot.
Uh...
Uh, it's rolling.
What's rolling?

You?
Or the earth?
No, that's not what I meant.
What, then?
I'm saying that the camera's rolling!

I want to type up something...
...for the meeting next week.
Sure.
Let's see...
I've been having difficulties lately...

Hey.
Can we talk about your PC for a sec?
It's hard to use other people's computers, Kagami.
A

Line
I didn't check my inbox for two or three days...
...and now it's mega full!
You don't look like someone who'd get a lot of mail.
Cousin Yui...
Doesn't even bat an eye...
Of course I get mail.
Maybe it's 'cause I visit all the right sites...
...but over 90% of these are junk or spam.
It's hard for me to respond...
...so don't admit those things to a cop, okay?
Still, I've been thinking...
It's impressive how they can come up with all these interesting titles.
That's true.

Played me like a fool...
Hello.
Welcome.
I heard Konata and Yutaka are sick?
Whew...
You okay, Yutaka?
This hasn't happened in a while.
Yo, Konata!
You ok—
Cousin Yui.
Welcome!
You don't have the strength to go to class...
...but you have enough to play games.
Well...
You know...
You should understand, Cousin Yui.
Hello!
Minami and friends.
You came to visit.
Thanks!
She's stuck in bed...
...but this is the first time she's had so much energy.
I really appreciate it, Minami-chan.
No.
I didn't do anything...
She had some close friends back in middle school...
Maybe you two just have good chemistry.
She's always talking about you.
She must be having so much fun at school.
You know how they say that sickness comes from the mind.
And it looks like people forget they're sick when they're having fun.
Hello!
Minami and friends.
You came to visit.
Thanks!
She's stuck in bed...
...but this is the first time she's had so much energy.
I really appreciate it, Minami-chan.
No.
I didn't do anything...
She had some close friends back in middle school...
Maybe you two just have good chemistry.
She's always talking about you.
She must be having so much fun at school.
Minami-chan, Tamura-san, and Patty-chan.
Welcome.
Are you okay?
Get well soon!
But...
I wonder why I'm so weak...
I don't like how I make other people worry.
Nah.
That ends up making people want to protect you.
Well, it may sound good in theory...
...but it's usually hard on the person.
You could say that...
...it's like how people who actually have little sisters...
...don't feel the charm of little sisters.
That's it!
Here it comes!
The normal folks are shunning us!
So this is the "no idea what you're talking about" aura!
It can't be helped!
We're outlaws!
Speaking of weaknesses...
...you're sensitive about how you have no breasts, right, Minami-chan?
Really?
U-Um, well...
They say that they get bigger if you massage them, right?
I've heard about that.
I-Is it really okay...
...Minami-chan?
You're the only one...
...I can ask to do this...
I-I'm going to touch you...
Control yourself...
Control yourself, girl!
So you're a member of that circle.
Yes.
I participated in the last Summer Comiket.
I have a few of your books.
Man...
That's very kind of you.
Really.
I want to see the manga you draw, Tamura-san.
Let me read some, Big Sister.
Sure thi—
I-I don't think that's...
Nah, Hiyorin.
Doujin works are meant to be seen.
Please have mercy!
Not to the normal people!
That's bad manners, Hiyorin.
Anyone but them!
That's incredible.
Then let's go over the answers.
Xylitol gum...
Yes.
Has the ability to reduce cavities.
That's because...
When Xylitol...
...is absorbed by bacteria...
...the bacteria's...
...ATP...
...is depleted and at the same time...
...the bacteria in the cavity...
...is broken down.
If they're so good for your teeth...
...I'll give it a try.
I was chewing gum to help my teeth...
...and a filling fell out.
Now I have to visit the dentist...
The assiduous, yet slightly unlucky Miyuki-san is so moe.
There, there.
And so...
...Miyuki-san was crying today.
It was so moe.
R-Really...
That's what Big Sister said.
So that's why Miyuki-san looked so down.
I feel bad for this Miyuki-san...
...but I'm going to use that material!
Well...
I haven't been able to come up with ideas...
How do you come up with ideas for manga?
There really isn't a single method to it...
...but I use a lot of stuff from personal experience.
P-Personal experience...?
You read them, didn't you?!
Um, well...
You read them, didn't you?!
Well...
After I begged her not to show you...
S-Sorry...
Those aren't based on personal experience...
B-But there were a lot of good stories...
...that I really enjoyed.
Thanks...
I think it's called déjà vu.
I felt like I'd experienced some parts.
I would also like to read them.
Sorry!
So sorry...
That was probably the one based on you two...
Teacher, good morning.
What's wrong, Izumi?
Up all night playing games again?
Or watching late-night anime?
Man...
They sure air a lot more late-night anime these days.
Great time to be alive...
Can't you just lie and say you were studying?
Really...
I was considering splurging on a DVD recorder or something.
Nah.
Don't do it.
You'll never get around to watching it.
Like how games pile up, huh?
What are you talking about?!
Hey!
Cut that out!
That's not funny!
Just so you know...
...it's none of my business what happens!
Hello?
You didn't hang up just now, did you?
Well...
I had three bars, but I still got cut off...
Well, I guess I was a little immature there.
Sorry.
It's not like I hung up on you.
Machida Dentistry
I've returned to this place again...
Okay...
Let's see which one fell out.
We can just stick it back in.
It'll be over soon.
But you've got another cavity developing in the back...
...so let's start treating that.
What's wrong?
I just realized that...
...strawberries smell like shortcake!
Er, don't you mean shortcake smells like strawberries?
Since it has strawberries inside.
H-H-Huh?
Well...
People mix stuff up like that every now and then.
Uncle.
Big Sister.
Good morning!
Yu-chan, good morning!
Today's Bow-Wow.
So many animals!
They're doing a special on pets.
First, we have...
...a Welsh corgi, Ku-chan.
It's a corgi!
So cute!
The owner's not too bad either.
She scores high for the thigh-highs.
And she has a nicely balanced absolute territory.
She'd look good in a gothic maid outfit.
Next, we have the Siberian husky, Silviana-chan.
It's a husky!
You don't see many of them these days.
I really like them.
This girl's gotta be a tsundere!
So moe.
Every girl with pigtails looks like a tsundere.
So you also play games, Kusakabe.
I like them, but I suck.
Wanna play a bit?
You're good, Hiiragi.
Wow!
Whoa, what was that?
Look!
Isn't Hiiragi amazing?
She really is.
Is this for real?!
When I see how much fun she's having...
Out of my league!
...I feel like a loser for caring so much about winning.
Total classic, right?
You go for the stink, huh?
Patricia-san.
Hello.
You've been visiting a lot recently.
Patty's a studious foreign student.
Which is why I've been teaching her
about the soul of Japanese culture every day.
The stuff you teach her...
...is only a tiny fraction of Japanese culture.
Otakus are the pride of Japanese culture!
My critical mission is...
...to absorb as much as I can...
...and take it back to America!
That's right!
I admire your passion...
Say, Patricia-san...
What kind of music do you listen to?
Let's see...
Orange Ran**.
Chemis***.
Suneoha**.
Porno Graffi**.
L'Arc~en~Ci**.
*inn.
Night****.
And many others.
I'm listening to many different Japanese artists!
That's a surprise.
But you know...
They all did anime songs, right?
Man.
You're so sharp, Konata.
And you only listen to their anime songs, right?
I'd like a maid.
A maid.
A maid, huh?
You live by yourself instead of in a dorm?
Yes.
I'm so busy with cooking, cleaning, manga, and anime!
I guess it'd be hard if you're not used to it...
You'd want to hire a housekeeper.
No, no.
Not a housekeeper.
A maid.
Aren't they the same thing?
Geez!
They're totally different!
What do they teach you in this country?!
Um...
Isn't your impression of Japan a little off?
I-I can't let you have this.
It's fried.
He won't give up because he knows you're soft.
It's hopeless.
Come here, I'll give you this.
Eat slowly now.
But now I feel a little lonely.
The class thinks that she's quiet and scary...
...but she's really kind, calm, and cool!
She's really admired by Kobayakawa-san, a relative of Izumi-san.
My...
Is that so?
Minami-chan!
Circular notice!
Minami-chan is calm and cool, huh?
Which reminds me...
Izumi-san also said...
She looks all cool and flawless...
...but when you see her with
Yu-chan, you can tell she's a good person.
That's what she said.
I'm sorry.
This is on sale...
...so it's limited to one per customer.
My...
Minami-chan is cool and flawless.
Also...
Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san...
Minami-chan looks like she can do everything quickly to perfection.
Minami-chan looks like...
...she could do anything.
I admire how she's so cool!
Minami-san...
...is also admired by...
...Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san.
Mom?
The item you wanted is limited to one per customer.
Oh?
Oh?
Oh?
Oh...
Minami-chan does everything quickly to perfection...
Yo!
Yo!
Welcome!
What'cha watching?
A mecha anime I rented.
Sure looks cool.
You still like this stuff, huh?
I'm not really interested in mecha.
You're not interested in mecha?
So why are you watching?
In order to grab a wider audience...
...recent mecha anime almost always...
...features a cute boy or girl.
Can you really call that a mecha anime?
Okay?
Hiiragi?
Got it?
It's a promise!
I'm counting on you tomorrow!
Yeah, yeah.
I'll take care of it.
Come on, Misa-chan.
Hiiragi-chan said okay.
You shouldn't keep bothering her.
But based on past experience...
People who say they'll take care of it never intend to.
Bah.
She's sharp about the oddest things...
Kagami-sama!
Let's stop by Gamers on the way home!
I don't need to buy anything...
..and I have something to do, so I'll pass.
C'mon...
Just for a bit...
No!
C'mon...
Don't play with my hair.
Besides...
You have bookstores in your town, don't you?
You know how once you've gone to a specialty store...
...a normal bookstore feels lacking in some way?
They might not have everything you want.
That's 'cause the stuff you want is too unique.
So?
What are you getting?
I'm getting this today!
You sure watch a lot of stuff...
I haven't watched the anime.
But the second I saw this cover...
...I felt a connection somehow.
It's been on my mind for a while.
I don't get it.
But you know...
I finally understand the concept of buying albums for their cover.
You know?
You choose light novels based on their cover, right?
Well, I can't deny it...
When it turns out to be good...
...you feel like you got a great deal.
And if it's not good...
...you don't regret it since you just bought it on a whim.
In other words...
...a once-in-a-lifetime encounter!
You might think that you're making sense there...
...but that's a stretch.
Let's take it easy.
Is this another once-in-a-lifetime encounter?
That was grandiose.
Cover your face.
Well...
You can't really control when you sneeze.
This is the first time I've heard
someone actually go "achoo" when they sneeze.
For some reason...
There's a world of difference between us after one sneeze...
No fair!
It's no fair how cute your sneeze is!
Don't tease her.
After a round, it actually smells good now.
But it's already over.
You two sure are close.
Do you guys ever fight?
Sure have!
Believe it or not...
...Ayano's really scary when she's mad.
It's true that some people are like that!
Geez...
Even Hiiragi-chan says so...
By the way...
You're always scary, Hiiragi.
So that's...
...my position in life?
Minami-chan runs the same time as you in the 100-meter dash.
Really...
But...
I bet if we actually raced...
...I'd win by the difference in our chests!
As if!
Smo――――oth
Fl――――at
Smooth and Flat Girls
W-Wouldn't Minami-chan win because of her height?
Flat chest...
Everyone just ignored that, huh?
Don't you agree, Hiiragi?
Isn't it fun, Hiiragi?
What do you think, Hiiragi?
Misa-chan's "don't respond to everything so dully"...
...and Hiiragi-chan's "don't talk to me when I'm reading" attitudes...
...are really electrifying the air.
Man...
The characters in Japanese anime and games are really moe.
Yep.
Huh?
Isn't this image bugged?
That's okay.
This is how it's supposed to look.
But it's still pretty naughty...
What kind of game are you playing there, high schoolers?
What are you all doing?
Yu-chan doesn't need to know!
It's done.
I haven't written a long blog entry in a while.
And submit...

Hey there!
I'm not gonna read you The Riot Act...
Depressed.
It doesn't matter what's happened...
The two of you...
You know?
Worked together to build this corner up from nothing, right?
And look at this.
Why destroy it all at the end?
Disappointed.
I've done some things to make people call me dark and gloomy...
...but I've never had to mediate a pathetic fight like this!
Understand?
If we don't resolve this immediately, boys and girls...
...it's gonna make me look bad, too.
Yeah, Shiraishi?
I-I'm terribly sorry.
Gotouther-sama.
What do you think, Akira?
I'm sorry, Goto—
I'm sorry, Gotouther-sama!
In that case...
Why don't you just kiss and make up?
Okay?
One more episode.
Why don't you find your original
conviction and finish Lucky Channel?
Well?
How does that sound?
Underst—
Louder!
Understood!
Okay.
That's that.
I'll let you two handle the rest.
Do your best to survive in the anime industry.
Then I'll go home first.
I'll talk to the producer.
Call me if anything else happens.
I could lend you some help, if you want.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
Shut up already!
Hey, people!
Can't you do a proper job on the last one?!
Are you listening?
Hey!

I'll do it myself!

Our class has decided...
...to host a fortune telling house for the festival...
...so please come up with your own method of fortune telling...
...before our next homeroom.
Tooth-brushing Exercising
The History of and How to Make Paulownia Cabinets
Haunted House
You worked hard!
I was touched!
And so...
I'm thinking about doing a cheerleading routine!
Cheerleading?
For the opening ceremony we talked about this morning.
It would be the best performance to pump up the festival.
It does sound flashy and fun.
Doesn't it?
We'll be the talk of the town!
B-By "we" you mean...
We're part of it?
I asked the teacher...
...and was told that the plan must be
properly developed, which requires members.
Wh-What about you, Yutaka?
M-Me?
It might be physically hard on Yu-chan.
Maybe I should give it a try.
I guess I might try if it isn't any trouble...
Trouble?
Absolutely not!
You're very welcome!
W-Will you be okay?
It'll probably be hard...
...so I might just hold everyone back...
...but I'd like to give it a try this time.
There!
Yutaka's willing to do it.
What do you two say?
In that case...
Well, if everyone's doing it...
I have wonderful friends!
Fortune telling, huh?
But do you even know how to tell fortunes?
Not a clue.
Oh my...
Hey!
Wasn't it your idea?
You can just wing it when it's for a cultural festival.
That's right...
What's your class doing, Sis?
Well...
We're being generic and going the haunted house route.
A classic, huh?
We couldn't come up with any other fun ideas.
Something wrong?
Nah.
I just thought it was very appropriate...
What are you trying to say?!
The real-life demon's angry!
Knew you would say that...
And so...
Patty-chan said she wanted to do cheerleading.
So...
I thought I might work hard at it.
Why?
I'm always absent...
...so I never accomplished anything with other people.
But I'm feeling better these days.
What I've been wanting to do...
...and what Patty-chan wants to do right now...
...might be the same thing, you know?
But it'll be pretty rough...
And...
We don't have enough people...
...so Patty-chan was wondering if you could participate.
So that's how it goes...
You're good at sports...
If people like you and Minami-chan are there...
...I might be able to hang in there to the end.
I can tell that you're really serious about
this, and Patty's also asking me for help...
Yes?
Hello?
Good evening!
Konata!
It's Patty, huh?
I just heard about your idea and was thinking it over...
Time for a quiz!
I'm holding a certain ticket in my hand right now.
Well...
What do you think the ticket is for?
C-Could it be...
Konata.
You loved the Jam, didn't you?
Don't you want to exchange a hot handshake with Haruhi?
Handshake session!
I wanna go! I wanna go!
Aya in the flesh!
By the way, Konata...
...weren't you about to say something?
Yu-chan.
Let's work hard to make some memories!
Which means...
This is the age of cheerleading, girls.
What kind of reasoning is that?
Patty came up with the idea of doing a cheerleading
routine during the cultural festival's opening ceremony.
Sounds fitting enough.
Which is why the two of you will also be dancing.
Are there any other people in your class who can dance, Kagami?
H-Hold it right there!
Don't just go on ahead without our permission!
I-I probably can't do that stuff...
But we probably won't get another chance like this.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
We'll be doing it with people we know.
Plus, it's a festival.
It's more fun if we go crazy with everyone.
Really?
You might be right!
You're so easily convinced...
I refuse.
I have to prepare for my class project.
I just wanted to make some memories
during our last cultural festival together...
You always bring up friendship out of nowhere!
It's obviously an act!
Yu-chan's really pumped up about this.
But will she be okay?
I told her she shouldn't do it...
But she was really earnest about
wanting to accomplish something with everyone.
R-Really...
But you know...
She said that they don't have enough people.
That's how I got involved.
I guess I was a little forceful about it.
I shouldn't push people into this.
I'll just ask someone else.
Fine...
What?
Fine!
I'll do it!
Sis!
Really?
I can't help it.
My class can just replace me with someone else...
...but you guys can't do that.
Kagami sure is cute.
Ch-Cheerleading, is it?
I'm not confident I'd do a good job...
Well...
We're not too sure about a lot of things right now...
Especially in terms of volume.
I'd feel a lot better if you joined us!
Is that so?
I understand.
If I can be of help...
Thanks, Boin—
I mean, Miyuki-san...
Testing is over...
...so we'll be focusing on preparations for the cultural festival...
...but don't get too relaxed!
Honestly...
They could cut down on testing when we have school events...
Yo!
Hey, Konata.
What's going on with the cheerleading thing?
That reminds me...
Before testing started...
"They approved the plan!"
...is what I heard...
But I haven't heard anything since.
What?!
How irresponsible!
We're not gonna have enough time to practice at this rate...
Or actually...
It's already too late!
Guess we'll go ask.
Sorry!
I haven't worked out the choreography yet!
Haven't worked out the choreography?
What are we supposed to do then?!
It's also taking time to pick a song.
It's not easy to find something on Hare Hare Yukai's level.
What was that?
Anyway...
If you were having trouble...
...you should have asked other people for help.
This was your idea...
...so you need to be responsible for scheduling!
So many difficult Japanese words I don't know!
How can you say that when
you've done perfectly fine up until now?!
At least get some of the choreography done today!
We'll work out the kinks as we practice!
Ask someone who's free if you can't figure something out!
Miyuki and I can handle general
scheduling and reserving a practice location!
We're counting on you!
Kagami...
You were pretty against this idea...
...but like...
...you're the most passionate one here.
Be quiet!
What are you going to do, Miyuki-san?
I'll be using tarot cards.
And what about you, Tsukasa?
I haven't decided yet...
Yuki-chan.
Is there something even I could do?
Let's see...
How about one that involves reading shapes?
Th-This shape...
...means that your love fortune is good...
...m-most likely!
Tsukasa.
You just made that up, didn't you?
Y-Ya think so?
W-Wait a second!
You want us to learn this?!
It's no good?
It's not an issue of quality...
It looks fairly difficult.
We don't have much time.
Shouldn't we just simplify the harder parts as we go?
Oh my...
But if we get through this...
...a wonderful feeling of satisfaction awaits us!
You shouldn't be saying that!
We're out of tape.
It can't be helped.
I'll make a trip to the store.
Then grab magic markers while you're at it.
And some exacto refills.
Cardboard!
Playboy.
Glue.
Something weird got mixed up in there...
And if we need to buy so much stuff...
...stop playing around and go buy it!
What are we calling the yakisoba?
A Fragrant Breath of Spring.
What's this Fallen Drop of Sunlight?
That's okonomiyaki.
Man...
You can't tell what's what on this menu!
Japanese culture is so fun.
This project seems to be abusing stereotypes...
Hey!
What are you guys doing?
Um...
A-A Zuka cafe.
1-D Cutou Festival Project
ZUKA CAFE
「WIND TROUBLE」
Wh-Wh—
What is this?
Basically...
It's a cafe where you can enjoy shows in the spirit of Zuka.
With girls in shiny dresses...
...and beautiful girls in male clothing...
...serving as waitresses.
Two for one!
Male clothing...?
That's right!
Yu-chan and Minami-chan are the leads!
In their dazzling, beautiful world!
When was this decided...?
I'm also worried about the cheerleading...
...but is this going to work?
Those two are something else.
You're very good, Minami-san.
Then let's try it again.
They sure are.
And they're perfectly in rhythm.
Okay!
By the way...
Would that be considered sadistic on the part of Miyuki-san...
...or masochistic on the part of Minami-chan?
When you put it that way...
Takara-senpai's dynamic dance moves...
...are probably putting pressure on Minami-chan.
Ya think so?
Just forget that and practice.
The cheerleading costumes are complete!
It looks great!
It looks wonderful...
...but it's a bit embarrassing.
These kinds of costumes make the people watching happier.
In fact...
...this outfit was chosen by one of those who like to watch.
The one you mentioned last time...
The dreadful, older Tamura brother.
You can expect some great Zuka costumes, too!
That's right...
You guys are doing a cheerleading routine, right?
Can I take pictures?!
Within reasonable limits.
I'll be careful...
Well...
We haven't done it successfully yet...
...so we're pretty worried.
I'll use my power to charge you up...
...so work hard!
Your power...
...might charge us up so much we tire ourselves out.
Basically like that.
It's pretty rough considering how we have no time left.
A cultural festival, huh?
What did we do for ours?
We had what you now call...
...you know...
...a manga cafe.
All the boys in our class...
...brought in their manga.
So you guys were ahead of your time.
It may seem normal to bring manga nowadays...
...but back when we were in school, they were strict about it.
You could only do it during festivals.
Well, people bring it to school...
...but it's not really approved...
A fortune telling house, is it?
Let everyone know...
...to give me a good fortune if I come.
B-But that wouldn't be fortune telling...
By the way...
How was it when you were in school?
I think each class or club had their own project.
The projects were stuff like haunted houses...
...and okonomiyaki vendors.
Pretty standard stuff.
It's rather strange how...
...it doesn't seem much has changed.
By the way...
...was a study of a cultural item such as Paulownia cabinets...
...ever used as a project?
What's that?
That wouldn't be any fun at all, now would it?
You're right...
Absolutely right...
Okay!
Time for a break!
It looks like we can pull off an exciting performance.
Well...
It's not complete yet...
...so hang in there to the very end.
This is when...
...it's a big help to have Hiiragi here to take command.
Well...
I don't want to be the only one left out of the memory.
Wh-What is it?!
Don't stare at me!
Sixteenth
Outou Festival
Now is your time to shine...
My...
Is that so?
I'm terribly sorry about that.
No trouble at all.
It appears that today's a rehearsal...
...and only students are allowed.
So?
We, the general public...
...can't get in until tomorrow.
That's why I told you to check before coming here!
But...
I heard that Akira-chan would be here today.
Geez!
What a waste of train fare!
16th Outou Festival
Open to Students 11/**
Open to General Public 11/**
If we still had that money...
...we could have had hamburger steak or something fancy!
Yeah...
I really dig this feeling of incompleteness.
Leave us alone.
And, like...
...you're walking around in that?
This serves as advertising.
Your costume's cute, Kona-chan!
Gotta start from the appearance.
I'll read lots of fortunes today!
In five minutes and fifteen
seconds, you will buy soft-serve ice cream...
In five minutes and twenty-eight
seconds, you will drop it on your leg.
It seven minutes and six seconds, you will hit your head on a sign.
Fortune telling doesn't mean to predict the future.
Word for word?!
You guys look great.
But...
...we're just as good!
It took till the very last second...
...but we're finally done!
So cute!
You look wonderful.
It's really embarrassing to walk around in this costume...
That's some outfit...
Oh, but it's cute.
Senpai.
Akira Kogami's about to go on stage.
Really...
I'll be right there.
Nice to meet you, Teacher.
I'm Akira Kogami!
I'll work hard today!
I'm...
...Sakuraba.
Today's like a rehearsal...
...so we'll just be running some check-ups...
Countin' on you.
Hey, Shiraishi.
You handle the rest.
Yes.
I'm the cultural festival planning committee chair, Shiraishi.
It's a pleasure.
I'm letting Shiraishi handle the rest...
...so let him know if you need something.
Please.
Okay!
Hey, you.
Say something.
You should have gone to the demon council.
Is something wrong?
No, nothing's wrong!
We were going through things...
...and got a little too excited!
Anyway...
You're an appreciated guest...
...so we'll treat you accordingly.
So?
After this...
...we'll need a mic check for Cape of Thirty Years on Lucky Channel.
Feel free to say whatever you
want after the song onstage tomorrow.
Well, I'll do a good job of it.
Then...
Please head to the stage.
Damn Shiraishi...
Lucky Channel
Weak...
Good lucky!
Thank you for coming to see Akira, everyone!
I hope you have lots of fun today!
She longs to be in the arms of her beloved...
Will such a day ever come?
As she drifts alone...
...guided by his words from that day...
She'll go anywhere in search of a trace...
Here's a song.
Akira Kogami-san with...
Cape of Thirty Years.
Would you mi—
Okay, that's enough!
Goddamn it!
Let me sing my song!
I told you it was just a check!
We don't have time!
Like I give a damn!
I'm going to kill you, bastard!
So many difficult Japanese words I don't know!
Is everybody ready?
This is the last run-through.
I came up with this idea a little spontaneously...
...but the fact that I've been given a
chance to do something with everyone...
...makes me really happy.
Instead of worrying about success or failure...
...I just think we should have fun!

We did it!
It's like, oh my.
Ya think so?
What's this?
You're still here?
We were practicing our cheerleading routine.
Really.
So how's it going?
Can't wait to see it.
Teacher!
I'm thirsty!
Guess it's okay.
I suppose I can buy drinks for hardworking young people.
Lucky!
Is it really okay?
Sure thing.
This is a special case, though.
In return...
...be sure to make the first event at the festival...
...a real blast!
Okay!
What's up, Tsukasa?
How should I put it...
It kinda feels strange.
That's right.
Actually...
...I'm also feeling a bit melancholic.
They say you have the most fun when preparing for a festival.
That's right...
Tomorrow's the real thing.
That's right.
We may never stay at school so late again.
You feel a bit lonely when you look at it that way.
Ta-Tamura-san...
Your face is really strained.
Yeah...
Like...
My stomach hurts...
Tsukasa...
You're frozen stiff, aren't you?
You don't look so calm yourself.
B-Being nervous helps you concentrate!
I think I'm so nervous I can't move.
Test. Test.
Then we will now begin the Outou Festival!
The first performance today...
...was submitted by a foreign student, Patricia-san.
A cheerleading routine performed by a group of friends.
Then let's begin...
U-Uh, sorry.
Cell phones should...
It's mine!
Crap!
Running into trouble at the very end!
That relaxed me so much I almost fell!
Great timing!
Wasn't that guy so lame?
They say that trouble tends to follow people around.
Well, I guess this is appropriate for us.
How we can never be serious, huh?
Okay, well...
Y'know...
Yes!
Sorry about that!
I'm really sorry!
Okay!
Then let's try that again!
Take it! Sailor Uniform!
Your whimsical nature is acting up again.
I'm so sad. Put an end to it.
You're probably dreaming about her again.
With a sigh...
So long in my dream...
She is an Angel.
(NO!) She is a Devil.
As far as you're concerned...
...she's a girl who set a sweet trap for you.
Your love is paradise.
Repeating over and over but now it's gone.
I love you.
Within my lips...
Maybe, just maybe...
Maybe love is...
...a boomerang we throw.
Maybe, just maybe...
Maybe love is...
...a boomerang we throw.
Ah, Cherry...
Good morning.
Good morning...
Good morning...
Everyone's coming over today...
So be a good girl, okay?
Hello.
Coming...
Hello, Miyuki-san.
I baked some cookies yesterday.
I thought I'd bring some over for you to try, Minami-san.
Hello, Cherry-chan.
Would you like to try some too?
H-Hey, Cherry!
What are you doing?
Well, dogs sometimes tend to do that.
Ah...
Would it be alright if I gave her a cookie?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure she would be happy to have one.
Here.
She went to bury it.
She didn't eat it, did she?
Ah, it's Cherry-chan!
Her nose is all black!
Huh, that's strange...
Where did it go?
My cell phone...
Cherry-chan...
You didn't bury it, did you?
C'mon...
Keep on looking around.
R-Right!
You sure have a dirty face...
You always seem to have it easy...
Meanwhile, Tsukasa loses her phone...
Konata is way late...
She didn't even bother to call us, as usual.
Ah, geez!
No, because I am.
A Scorpio woman.
I'll laugh heartily.
Until I'm satisfied.
Hello!
Hello, Cherry!
Your paws are so hard...
Not comforting at all!
These paws aren't squishy like they are in manga...
I am in despair!
No reaction whatsoever.
Cherry, stupid dog.
There are times when even if call her, she won't wake up.
Also, she's not stupid.
Cherry, you stupid dog.
Cherry, you lazy bum.
L-Lazy bum?
Cherry...
You fat dog.
Drooling dog.
Stupid dog.
Lazy bum.
Oh!
At least she's aware.
A stupid dog like yourself that sleeps all day...
...deserves to be called a lazy bum!
Whenever I try, no matter what I do...
...she never wakes up.
Ah, she's sleeping right here.
Hello.
It's been a while, hasn't it?
Hello.
Hello.
You're such a cute and quiet dog, aren't you?
Thank you, thank you.
Cherry-chan, you're so cute!
Cherry-chan, you're so cute!
What are you doing?
C-Cherry-chan was being so quiet...
...so, I couldn't resist...
But to have a huge dog like this lying in the hallway...
This house sure is laid-back.
Well, she's so quiet.
Just looking at her makes me feel at ease.
I have a dog at home too, so I totally know what you mean.
Anyway, didn't you need to use the restroom?
Oh, right!
Excuse me for a bit.
So relaxing.
What-!?
You're so quiet around the others...
Why are you suddenly reacting to me?
Slowly...
Oh...
You're a good girl today, aren't you?
Okay, shake.
Not gonna do it, huh?
You're Minami-chan's dog, so I thought you would be a bit smarter...
Oh, I know!
Wait, wait!
Sit, girl!
Sit!!
What an honest dog...
Well, then...
Shake!
H-Hey!
Lay off!
Please stop...
Here.
I don't understand big dogs at all...
What the-!?
D-Don't spit it out!
Minami, dinner time!
Mom, Cherry's not eating her dinner.
Seems like it...
I even put in some of the canned food you got for her.
But she still won't eat it...
I thought she liked that stuff.
Cherry...
Cheer up.
We're all worried about you.
What happened to your face?
What were you digging up?
Oh, I get it...
You were eating the stuff you buried?
That's fine...
As long as you're happy, Cherry...
That's all I need.
Still, that was pretty sudden.
Why did you start playing online games, Hiiragi?
Eh?
Sensei, believe it or not...
Kagami is a big fan of the artist who worked on the anime adaptation for this game.
Seriously?
So you've finally given into the dark side, huh?
Konata!
Don't say unnecessary things!
Huh?
But if you want to copy the anime, then aren't the Hiiragi sisters a mis-casting?
It should be the reverse.
Ouch!
Konata!
Kagami, thx!
Nothing to it.
Sensei...
For the sake of our own survival...
...swapping them would be a fatal mistake.
I see what you mean...
I feel a lot safer this way.
Hey, Konata...
I have a feeling the jobs we have in the game...
...and the ones that are in the anime are different...
Oh, those are higher level jobs.
We have to transfer professions from our current jobs to get those done.
How do you switch jobs?
Coming soon.
Huh?
Well, it happens all the time.
They claim that the anime and game will progress concurrently...
...but once the anime finishes airing, it's all "coming soon."
But when you're in a game world like this, you start getting immersed.
And you really do get reminded of those game-based anime.
Oh yeah, like the one they set up to look like an online game but was actually offline.
I wonder why they didn't release that online.
I honestly believed that it was an online game, and I went looking for it all over the place.
That does seem to happen often.
Tsukasa, just hit ENTER.
Ah.
Aah, aah...
Yay, I can finally talk!
I was wondering why you weren't talking...
If you don't hit ENTER, you won't talk.
Man, it's so nice forming parties with people you know.
You're so right.
Pick-up groups are hit or miss, so it's a gamble every time.
What do you guys usually do, Kona-chan?
Just start spamming for groups or form one myself.
Then again, there are lots of times when no one picks me up.
If you miss the prime time for groups, then you end up playing solo the whole night.
'Cause no one ever wants to be the party leader.
And everyone just looks for groups.
Not to mention there are lots of times where you get too many of the same class.
And if you form a group in a rush, you could end up wasting even more time wiping.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about!
Tsukasa, your spells never do much damage, do they?
That's weird...
Mages are supposed to be strong enough to solo-farm.
Where are you putting your stats?
Stats?
Eh!?
B-But normally in games...
...when you level up, you just automatically learn spells.
So, I thought this was just like that...
Indeed...
Here it is!
Now that I'm level 10, I can attack twice!
If I keep leveling up, I wonder if I can pull off three attacks...
Hmm...
What is this feeling of déjà vu...?
It feels very much like I'm playing a Lodoss tabletalk RPG...
More nonsense...
This game's got a lot of emotes.
Sensei, we should make a victory pose for our party!
Was that really necessary?
Yes, yes it was, Kagami. Especially since we're online.
This floor has 3 enemies and a hidden treasure.
For this boss, I'll pull him away and kite him, so you guys DPS him from behind.
He's weak to fire, so make sure you take advantage of that.
If you talk to that guy over there, he'll give you a quest.
Next, you just talk to the old man by the exit and you'll get some cash.
Kona-chan, you know so much.
Lately, all that information is floating around the net.
There are some amazing sites that'll have a complete walkthrough uploaded the same day.
It's almost as though they're getting paid for it.
If only they could redirect all that energy into fueling society...
...and make themselves useful.
This is invincible Pizza-La Shield, there's nothing to fear!
P-Pizza-La?
It's an in-game promotional item.
If you order a pizza, you can get such special items.
Why do I feel like you're falling into their trap?
Man...
Even though I'm aware of it, I still do it for some reason.
You too!?
Eh?
A trip?
We're going to the hot springs as a family.
So I don't think we'll be on during Golden Week.
Oh, I'm going somewhere with Yu-chan, too.
I hope it won't be too crowded...
After Golden Week
Sensei...
Don't tell me...
And so, what did this kid do after that?
This is the right answer.
Eh?
Yes, Mayumi-chan.
Then we're off to go see the ball.
Watch over the house, okay?
Okay.
Kagami, you're really not going to go?
Yeah, it's too much trouble anyway.
Are you sure?
You're going to miss out on this chance.
I'm starting to get a bit nervous.
Tsukasa, why don't you try participating?
Eh?
T-That's impossible!
We're off.
Make sure to lock up, okay?
Okay, okay.
Take care.
Still, this wife is pretty scary.
Do you think so?
Something like this is normal, right?
She didn't think so at all!
I shall make that wish of yours come true!
Where did you come from?
And what's with that getup?
Now, now...
By the way, my current designation is a mage.
What do you mean, "designation?"
Oh, is that so...?
Your evil stepmother and sisters are picking on you, huh?
Huh?
What's this?
You want to go to the ball too?
No, I said nothing of the sort.
In other words...
You're the fairy godmother, and I'm Cinderella...
...and now I must get on a carriage and go attend the ball?
That's correct.
Which is why....
That's not even a carriage!
Don't worry about the details, Kagami.
Okay, let's head out!
Kagami, you get on as well.
No.
Geez...
Do you really want to have a carriage that much?
No!
I don't even know what the hell you're talking about!
And I never intended to go to the ball in the first place.
Now, now...
Don't talk like you know it all.
Anyway...
I'm not going, got it?
For sure?
For sure!
No matter what?
Enough!
Geez...
What was she thinking?
Ah!
I forgot to have her turn that back to normal.
Whoa!
A-An earthquake?
Whoa!
W-What the hell is this?!
Oh, Kagami...
I wouldn't go outside right now if I were you.
Is this your doing?
Yup.
Stop it already!
But you refused to leave the house...
I told you that I don't want to go, didn't I?
Then I'll just go to the dance hall like this.
Okay, fine!
I'll go, now stop all of this!
Aren't you looking forward to the ball, Kagami?
Not at all.
I bet the truth is that you're really happy.
You tsundere, you.
Stop calling me a tsundere!
Besides, why is a fairy godmother such as yourself coming along too?
Oh, yeah...
We should take this opportunity to get you all dressed up.
Hey, are you even listening to me?
Here.
I guess this is the default selection.
Hey, this isn't something you'd wear to a ball!
No, no...
I think you're more than qualified for that type of niche, Kagami.
What are you talking about?
Anyways, change my clothes back!
Huh, after I went through all that trouble?
I never asked you to!
Change it back right now!
Okay...
Hey, you didn't fix anything!
I guess you could call this another type of "default".
Besides, this is your usual cosplay.
Don't call it cosplay!
Somebody's gonna get hurt real soon...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
I'll do it right this time.
Ah.
It fell off...
Huh?
Sorry, but it looks like I can't change your clothes back to normal.
We're here!
Fighters' ball in Saitama: Love is touch and endless.
How 'bout this?
Winner, Kuroi Nanako!
All right!
Today, I will escape from my life as a bachelorette!
You just wait for me, Prince Misao!
Okay!
Win, win, and keep on winning!
Whoever wins this competition...
Will be my bride!
They're really getting into it...
Whatever, I don't care.
Oh, Hiiragi-chan!
I knew you would come after all!
Love.
Be quiet.
Don't touch me.
Did you dress up like this just for me?
No.
Hiiragi, you're participating too, right?
Not a chance.
C'mon, just participate.
I'll fix all your matches.
Then why even have a competition?
First of all, I don't want to participate...
...and second, I don't want to become your bride!
What is this, Hiiragi...?
You're being pretty cold...
Don't worry, prince, this is just her "tsun" side.
Oh, which means deep down...
No!!
Geez...
I know this was going to happen, which is why I didn't want to go!
Anyways, I'm going home now.
Eh?
You're leaving already?
When the clock strikes midnight, all the magic will be undone anyways, right?
If I don't leave now, the car will disappear.
How did she know?
Who cares, who cares?!
Let's play!
It's time for the fight predictions!
Are you a little kid?
Hey, Konata.
The house is still displaced!
Can't you move it back to its original location?
I fixed the Starring Inferno, so everything should be okay!
Why do I not feel reassured?
Is it really okay?
Eh?
I guess time's up.
No way!
It's already past midnight?
What about the house?
I guess it'll have to stay like this.
Stay like this?
Can't you do something with your magic?
Actually, I was also on the receiving side of a magic spell...
Which is why I can't do anything past 12AM.
What do you mean you can't...
Oh, right...
I just remembered a spell to reset everything.
Really!?
Then why didn't you say that earlier?
Well you  have to say this one, not me.
Then tell me already!
It's...
Do I really have to say that?
Yup.
Really loud, too.
Really loud!?
Yep.
Ugh...
Things won't return to normal if you don't.
Fine, then.
I want to ***** with Konata.
Don't worry, Sis.
I won't say a word.
No!
It's not what you think!
Oh yeah, I should go mail Kona-chan.
T-Tsukasa, listen!
You've got it totally wrong!
It was against my will...
What I meant is that she totally...
Here!
You did it!
That was amazing, Hiiragi-chan.
It was just luck, I swear.
There's no way I could hit that...
Hiiragi's little sis.
Don't give up.
Kusakabe-san.
Do you want to live in Hiiragi's shadow forever?
But...
No buts!
Today's your big chance to show your sister up!
Muster up some courage and prove to your sister that you can do it too!
O-Okay.
We'll show 'em the true power of a support character!
I-I'll do my best!
Oh, what a nostalgic scene...
There!
Alright!
Here!
And that's how it's done!
I was so close...
Not bad, Kusakabe!
Here it goes...
Super Ultra Miraculous Eccentric Special...
Serve!
An underhand serve?!
Leave it to me!
Nice receive!
Here!
Not bad...
Not bad at all...
Misakichi, Tsukasa.
We're gonna do a Jet Stream Attack on the attacker!
Roger!
Okay!
By the way, what's a Jet Stream Attack?
Ahh, you're not supposed to say that!
Now the plan won't work!
What are you guys doing?
Take this!
Take that!
Yes!
Eh?
Little Sis!
Tsukasa!
Something like that is impossible...
However...
Even when it's tough
The tears had fallen.
What's that?
Eh!?
You don't know it?
It's cutural literacy for the Japanese!
You're the only one that feels that way.
Little Sis...
There's no point in sulking there.
You're gonna beat down Hiiragi today, right?
I...
I've always been relying on Sis...
Yeah...
Yeah...
I'm sorry.
I'll do everything I can!
I got it!
Good job, Little Sis!
Guu~
One more point...
...and our team will...
...win!
Let's do this!
We won't lose, Hiiragi!
I won't let it...
...end like this!
Here!
Spin.
Stop.
Just call me the Witch of Kasukabe.
There!
Go for it, Little Sis!
Hit it with everything you got!
Alright!
Ow, it hurts as if I just smacked into something.
We did it!
You really shined today, Hiiragi-san.
Eh, really?
Nothing less from Hiiragi-san.
Thanks.
That was amazing!
It was.
Damn it...
I suppose the supporting characters...
...are never meant to win...
I guess I still can't match Sis.
But...
Someday, surely...
Heaven has forsaken us!
Hey, let's go.
Yeah...
I was just trying to get into the mood.
Stop messing around.
Come on.
This is a story that happened during a summer camping trip for our school.
We had decided to take a hike and were in the midst of our orienteering course.
That's when our group...
...somehow ended up lost.
How did this happen?
It's because you  forgot the map and compass on the bus!
Besides, why did we have to go this way?
Well, I suddenly had the urge to climb a mountain.
And why is that?
"Why?" you ask...
Because it's there.
Now now, Sis.
How about we start by checking our cell phones?
As expected, out of range.
Me too.
I got nothing.
Same.
I guess we're doomed.
Ah, geez...
We should've been at the camping grounds by now.
That's true.
According to the schedule, we were supposed to start making dinner at 5PM.
Reacted to the word "dinner", huh?
What about you, aren't you hungry?
Just a bit...
But I ate a ton of these on the bus.
Oh, again!
That one was me.
Anyways, how about we escape absolute starvation with these...
S-Starvation seems a bit exaggerated.
But these...
One, two, three...
We're one short!
Um, may I?
This way, there will be six total.
If we give everyone one piece...
..we can then break the last two into halves again.
How about that?
Yuki-chan, you're incredible!
Nothing less from our Miwiki-san!
Oh it's nothing, really...
Now we won't have to starve to death.
Like I said, you're exaggerating.
However...
Izumi-san's words began to seem like less and less of a joke...
...and more of a reality.
I have a feeling we're completely and utterly lost.
Yes.
We've been walking the same area over and over.
Ah, if only we had a magnet.
I guess I need to smack you across the face with this.
Or perhaps I should shove it down your throat?
How scary!
Kagami, you're serious!
Um...
That looks like the Summer Triangle.
Therefore, I'm pretty sure this direction is East.
Wow Tsukasa, that's pretty amazing.
Tsukasa, do you like stars that much?
Um, this is the only one I know.
One of the big stars of the Summer Triangle is called Vega...
...but it's also the Orihime Boshi.
Since we were born on Tanabata.
The Big Dipper also looks really beautiful.
Listen up, Kagami!
Until the day the Death Omen Star has fallen...
...you must live your life to the fullest!
Although, even if we do know the cardinal directions...
...we still don't know how to get to the camp.
And such is our problem.
Heaven has forsaken us!
Enough of that.
After screaming like that, I'm seriously starting to get hungry.
And whose fault is that?!
I never spoke of the idea openly...
...but I was seriously...
...starting to consider the possibility that we wouldn't make it back.
We're not descending...
Yes.
We've walked quite a bit, huh?
That's right.
I wonder if we lost our sense of direction inside the forest.
You may be right.
Story number ten.
In the silent forest...
...you could hear the *pant* *pant* of their breathing...
What are you doing?
The Gathering of One Hundred Supernatural Tales.
If you tell a hundred ghost stores in a single night...
...a real ghost will descend upon you!
Eh?!
When that happens...
...you can feel a cold sensation on your cheek...
Stop messing around.
But...
...a campout at night means ghost stories!
And after, love stories!
Huh?
D-Did I say something weird?
Story number eighteen.
I tried calling out, "Hey!"
But there was only silence...
...then all of a sudden-
Is that supposed to be the sound of you blowing out a candle?
Yeah.
In The Gathering of One Hundred Supernatural Tales...
...you're supposed to blow out a candle...
...each time you finish a story, right?
That's our Miwiki-san!
And then...
Huh?
What story was I on again?
Story number sixteen, probably.
You're going backwards!
Yes, this is Sazae-
Don't you mean Izumi!?
Where the hell are you guys right now?
Do you guys have any  idea how worried we all were?!
What awaited our return to the camping grounds...
...were Kuroi-sensei's harsh words.
Which is why...
...you must be extra  careful from now on!
We're sorry...
You're hungry, right?
It's delicious.
Yeah, it really is.
Yep, yep.
Indeed...
...the curry we had that day was truly delicious.
Perhaps, it was even the most delicious curry I had ever had.
And so something outrageous like that happened.
It was a really troublesome day.
Oh?
But you seemed to be enjoying yourself while you were telling the story.
Is that so?
Yes.
Very much so.
Yes.
I suppose so.
Hey Kagami.
There's a place I want to stop by on the way back...
We're going straight  home with no detours.
Don't say that...
It won't take long at all.
No way!
But why?
You're getting annoying!
Don't say such harsh words...
Gah, get off of me!
Okay, fine!
But just for a little bit, okay?
Thank you, Kagami!
You're such a nice person, Kagami!
We're going straight home afterwards, okay?
Sure, sure.
By the way, Kona-chan...
Where are we stopping at?
Oh yeah, well...
Some pet show that just recently opened up.
Pet Shop
Oh, a pet shop?
How nostalgic!
Minoru~pa~
Are you going to buy a dog or something?
I want to look at the bunnies.
I want to see the cute puppies.
Not at all.
This  is what I wanted to look at.
Ah, this cat has really nice fur.
Konata, I'll remind you right now...
This cat isn't a witch
or anything, so don't
bother it, okay?
...this cat isn't a witch or anything.
I know that.
I know that. I won't go as far as collecting its soul.
I won't go as far as collecting its soul.
Everything you've said up until now...
I am Zero!
I have returned!
I have returned!
I will use you up like a ragged cloth!
I will use you up like a ragged cloth!
Ah, this cat must have really nice lineage.
Yuki-chan, you come from a really nice lineage as well.
Hey, hey...
I don't think you're using that in the right context.
Well...
Right now, Miyuki-san is the Galactic Fairy.
The Galactic Fairy
Although her appearance is slightly different...
These are the most famous frogs in Pekopon.
Ge~ro Gero Gero
Ta~ma Tama Tama
Ge~ro Gero Gero!
Ta~ma Tama Tama!
Ge-ro Gero Gero
Ta-ma Tama Tama
Ge~ro Gero Gero!
Ta~ma Tama Tama!
Oh!
I'm a dark-spotted frog.
I look like a Japanese tree frog.
I seem to be a bullfrog.
I'm a common toad...
Hey, wait a second!
Hmm...
Now then...
What happened here?
Alrighty then!
For-For-For-Forgot my something...
Oh!
That's...
Legendary Girl A!
This means...
...I must have her buy something!
Behold! The best armament I have collected!
With these slick deals...
Not even Legendary Girl A can resist!
Dammit! She's AFK?!
Good lucky!
It's this era's super...
...super idol, Akira Kogami here!
Long time no see, everyone!
And...
And...!
Her assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
Moving on!
Wait!
Everyone, if he hears you call out for him, I think he'll show up.
But if you're really quiet, he might now hear you...
So please, say it as quietly as you can.
Hey!
Now then, one , two...
Minoru-senpai...
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa!
So, you've appeared after all...
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa...
Wa~
Wa-wa-wa-wa-waa...
You didn't have to show up...
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-waaaa...
Wa-waah...
Hello! I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
You're not gonna do a little skit for us?
A skit?
Usually...
...you would stop in front of the camera...
Yes.
And then you would say, "And now I'll put on a little performance..."
Right?
Now, let's try it!
Start!
How's that?
That's 10 years worth of experience for you.
Not bad at all.
Thank you very much.
And so, nice to meet you, everyone.
Speaking of...
Yes.
What's this?
Oh, this?
It's something that's pretty popular around these parts.
Nezumi-senpai.
Hmm...
Right now, it's totally in style.
I hear it's the best.
Okay, whatever.
What?
Anyways!
You don't even care?
Okay, what is it then?
What I'm referring to is this entire situation.
What's up with this?
Eh?
What's up with what?
Well, it's a live-action filming.
A live...
A live Lucky Channel.
Something like that...
It's so loud!!
Now, now, now, now...
Let's calm down, okay?
I mean, c'mon...
Isn't this lovely?
It's lovely.
What is this?
What's up with that teary-eyed face?
I'm telling you, this is an animation!
Oh, but there was an animation.
Just before this.
What about me?
W-Well...
What about Akira Kogami?
Yes.
Let me repeat myself...
Okay.
I'm this era's...
Right.
This era's...
Super idol!
Right, right.
That's correct.
Which is why...
...we had you do this live performance that one one else could pull off.
I mean...
...it's a visual animation.
So we need to have some animations...
...and also some visuals...
Which is why...
Ah.
By having both parts separate and then together...
...it'll be twice as good.
I just realized.
What?
It's a bit like...
And Original...
Yes.
...Visual...
...and Animation?
Animation?
Yes.
So, Minoru Shiraishi is an original...
Yes.
...in the visual...
...as well as the animation?
That means the entire program is about you!
Wait...
That's not true!
Geez!!
You have it wrong!
Even though Akira is supposed to be the super idol!
You're absolutely correct.
Why are all the staff...
...on Minoru-kun's...
Geez!!
Okay, okay...
Please calm down.
There's not enough love!
Calm down.
I am shocked.
Shocked?
YOU are SHOCK!
The skies have fallen from love.
Um..
Yeah...
YOU are SHOCK!
Look...
My heart has fallen.
It's playing...
Look.
Um, the theme song...
See?
Even bound by chains, the heart burns.
What's this?
Oh this... this is nothing!
It's useless now.
It'll disappear over here, so don't worry about it!
The staff, everyone, loves you...
Those who interfere will be taken down by a single finger.
Don't worry, Akira-sama.
It's hot.
It's too hot?
Oh, excuse me?
Could we get some water or something?
Thank you very much.
YOU are SHOCK!
Staff, may I have some water?
The pulse quickens from love.
Yes, please.
Some water, please... ah.
Here, here it comes.
Thank you very much.
Now, please rest a little, okay?
YOU are SHOCK!
My pulse quickens.
Okay?
Yeah...
Anyways...
Searching for you,
This is fine too.
Yeah...
My wandering heart is now burning up.
Like I was saying...
Now that I think about it, I'm a little thirsty, too.
Everything must dissolve and scatter apart tragically.
Excuse me, um...
Um...
Staff!
Staff!
Um, could I also...
To protect our love,
...get some water here?
Staff!
You departed on a journey.
Staff!
Ah, yes.
I would like some water...
Had lost sight of tomorrow.
Wait...
Why are you taking the mic?
H-Huh, that's a bit strange...
Umm...
I don't want to see,
Hey, where's my water?
My water...
Staff~
Such a face that has forgotten how to smile.
Reclaim the love!
I see...
So that's how it is...
You are already dead!
Huh?
But...
You know...
This is all wrong.
While this certainly is water...
It's not quite what I was expecting...
Hey...
It's...
...wrong...
Oh.
Welcome back.
You know...
I mean... seriously.
Yes.
Something like that...
Yeah, yeah...
Well...
You know...
And so...
Yes.
I've been thinking...
They kept on telling me, "You'll be in the main series."
Yes.
But those were all empty promises.
So then I tried being a pop star...
...but that didn't last long, either.
Right.
And so...
...I even told them that I was willing to play some side parts and the like in the main series, you know?
Right.
But here I am...
It'll be fine, Akira-sama!
You'll see!
Good things will happen!
But they haven't...
Not matter what I do...
It's like there's just not enough love in here...
Akira...
Akira-sama, the ending...
Ehh?!
It's the end already?
Akira's so lonely!
That's it for today.
And then this!
Oh, this is new.
Certainly...
Right around here.
Around here.
Somewhere...
Please send all your love to Akira!
Yes.
Please!
And thus...
Yes.
I await the next time we can see each other again!
But for now, bye-bee!
Bye-bee!!
I'm seriously going to do my best.
I'm already at the top.
As high as the heavens.
Thank you very much.
What?
What is it?
You know...

Yes.
I've decided.
About what?
Well...
Yes.
I'm going to aim for the top.
Yes.
Somewhere so high you can't touch me.
That's a good idea!
Something like that...
You're approaching it then.
Slowly but surely...
Like...
Inching your way to the top.
You know,
Right, it makes me think I should climb to the top.
Right, right.
Something like...
The both of us climbing to the top...
Zoom!
Zoom!
Let's do it. Just like that.
And we'll figure it out just like that.
Right?
And we'll be at the top just like that.
Seems unreliable, but I'll give it a shot.
Alright!
On your mark! Get set!
Wow. That was so amazing! You're so good at sports and I always wondered: How come you don't join a team or anything?
'Cause if I got on a team and started playing sports, I'd miss all of my prime-time anime shows. Hey, which end of a chocolate cornet do you eat first?
Huh? Umm, I think I start at the head.
Really... So which side of this thing's the head, anyway? The fat part or the skinny?
I always thought that this end of it, the thin one, was the head.
Oh. See, I always thought the fatter end was the head. So, why do you think the thinner end's the head?
Doesn't it look like a seashell? Why do you think it's the fatter end?
I always thought it looked more like a caterpillar.
A caterpillar?
Yeah, but when you think about it, I guess a seashell's a much better image.
Um, you know... There's another way to eat it. Tear off the thin end and dip it in the chocolate cream on the fat end.
Good idea!
It figures you'd know that. You're so smart!
Well, not really. Everyone has their own way of eating one.
How about cream puffs? How do you eat them?
Huh? How do I eat a cream puff? That's easy. I split it in half horizontally, then I take the top half and dip it into the cream in the bottom part. Then, after most of the cream is gone, I start eating the bottom. I find that if I eat it that way, it keeps the cream from spurting out, and I can have equal amounts of cream and pastry in each bite.
Huh...
What do you do about the ones that have both custard and cream? Do you have a system to eat those? Do you mix the flavors together?
No, I don't have a system for those per se. Wait, how exactly does one mix the flavors?
Uhh, just asking...
When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake? Or a chestnut on top of a mont-blanc?
Let's see now... It depends on the amount of strawberries that are sandwiched between the layers of sponge cake. With the strawberries, the whipped cream and the sponge cake, I pace it so that I can get a bit in each and every bite. So getting to the strawberry on top of the cake is always different for me.
Hmm... That's a solid move.
When I eat it, I always save the strawberry on top for last. Sometimes, I get so full that I can't eat it. In other times, someone in my family comes along and takes it away.
And that's why you should always eat your favorite part first.
Come to think, I've never seen anyone take her strawberry away from her.
That's her for ya! She's sharp.
Here's one. Can you eat the very last bite of an ice pop without dropping it?
Wait, you drop it?
If you don't eat it the right way... It falls off, doesn't it?
Yes.
How do you do it?
I suck it off the stick.
Oh...
Or maybe you could just turn it around while you eat it, like this.
Oh, that's a good idea.
And then there's soft-serve ice cream, which I'm not very fond of.
Huh? What's wrong with it?
I hate how you're always left with an empty cone at the end of it.
You're right. There's never any ice cream left, just the cone.
I always try to push the ice cream further and further down into the cone as I eat it.
But how in the world do you do that?
While I eat it, I do a push and shove thing.
A push and shove thing?
You try to balance everything out, don't you?
I suppose.
Oh, here's another one. How do you eat curried rice? Do you mix the curry with the rice?
No, but I do try to have equal amounts of curry and rice left over for my last bite.
I like mixing it up. How do you eat it?
It all depends on the curry. If I pour some sauce on it or drop a raw egg on top, then I mix it up.
You put sauce on curry?
Oh, yeah. It's tasty.
Do you put sauce on fried eggs too?
Nope, I put soy sauce on fried eggs.
Oh. See, when I use that I use mayonnaise.
Mayonnaise on fried eggs, but not on hard-boiled eggs?
Mm-hm. You know, mayonnaise is good with pretty much every egg dish.
You put it on curry too?
Mm-hmm! I put mayo on white rice and on beef bowls. It goes good with that sweet broth. Oh, and on parent-child bawls, too. You know how the chicken's the parent and the egg's the child? And how mayonnaise is made from eggs too? I just put a little blob of it on top and I call that the Relative Bowl.
Hmm.
And I used to really hate natto beans, but if I put some mayonnaise on them, I can eat 'em.
Ugh, I can't imagine that.
Oh, but the tastiest thing has to be when you put mayonnaise right on top of some soft-boiled eggs!
Even the fried eggs are half-cooked at my house.
Really?
Yup. That's just how my dad likes his eggs. I guess it's because he always liked to suck on the yolk. So if you fry the egg too much, then the yolk gets too hard and my dad can't suck the yolk out.
So, how do you eat chicken skewers?
What do you mean "how"?
Do you eat it right off the skewer? Or do you pull it off with chopsticks?
Let me see... When I'm alone, I'll eat it off the skewer. But when I'm eating in public or with company, I'll use chopsticks to pull it off.
Yeah, and dontcha feel weird when there's only one piece left on the plate?
Yes. The last bite certainly makes things awkward at the table.
And then it gets later and later, and no one eats it. It gets all dry and stale, and it's not lookin' so tasty. And no one really wants to eat it, but they don't wanna say anything. And then the waiter comes over to take the plate, and you're like, "Whoa, we're still eating that!" In the end, we all go home without eating that last bite.
Oh, that's such a waste!
I feel sorry for it... Oh, with Korean barbecue, I feel sorry for the meat that's left on the grill that turns to charcoal.
Well, at a Korean barbecue, you're always eating and chatting at the same time. So you get a little distracted.
And when you're grilling beef tongue with green onions, that cooks really fast!
Oh, you're so right. It's already done cooking by the time you flip it over, isn't it?
Wait. You flip it over?
Huh?
You flip it over?
Hm.
You should never flip beef tongue with green onions!
Why shouldn't I flip it?
'Cause if you flip it over, all the green onions on top will fall into the grill!
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You don't need to flip it over at all. You roast it on one side and the heat cooks it all the way through.
I get it. I guess I'll do that from now on.
You absolutely, positively never flip it.
Never flip it.
Ever.
Oh...
Oh, which end of a chocolate cornet is the head - the fat end or the skinny end?
Eh!
Such a bad boy! What's with all the kidnappings lately? I mean, these guys imprison girls and force them to call them "Master" and stuff. It's sick.
Oh...
I think it's about guys playing way too many dating sims and erotic games. The "Master/Slave" thing is a pretty common scenario, you know.
Oh yeah, like you'd know all about that. Wait, you're a sophomore, how do you know about erotic game scenarios?!
You're amazing. You're always at the top of the class.
Huh?
Don't you have any faults?
It's a little embarrassing, but I guess I tend to think about things too much. So much that I end up spacing out. I sometimes cut my finger using the veggie slicer. Ow! Sometimes I'll trip on my feet and fall down. Or, a corner of my tote bag will get caught in the train's door.
Wow...
Whoa, hold it! Those aren't called faults. People call those moe points!
Huh? "Moe points"?
Clumsy is sexy.
What have you been thinking this whole time?
How come you wear glasses? I mean you're really pretty, but you can only appeal to a tiny section of the fan base.
Appeal to... Besides the whole popularity thing, don't glasses actually make your vision worse? How come you never switched to wearing contacts?
Well, it's a little embarrassing to admit now that I'm in a high school. But I suppose you could say... I'm afraid of contact lenses! Actually, I'm pretty scared to put anything into my eyes. I can't even open my eyes underwater.
Dang! She's a natural airhead. A total cutie pie! Hey, isn't that over there?
Huh?
I wonder if she broke down and decided to get some contacts. I guess she's probably better off with the glasses after all.
That must have hurt.
And she's that way naturally.
Staying home 'cause she's got a cold, huh?
Mm-hmm. But at least she's only got a cold and not the flu, you know?
Thankfully I'm stupid, so I don't have to worry about catching flus and stuff.
I heard that works with a cold, but I didn't know it was the same for the flu.
I thought the flu was the deluxe version of the cold. You're saying that colds and flus are two different things?
I... I guess I think they're different things... Or maybe they aren't, I don't know anymore. I'm kinda confused now.
Oh, the difference between influenza and a cold?
Mm! Mm!
Let me see now... Influenza is a viral illness with many symptoms such as fever and muscle aches. If it's not treated, there's a risk of more serious complications. On the other hand, the symptoms of a cold are sore throat and a runny nose, and the fever doesn't run as high. Those are just a few of the symptoms that differ from the flu.
Hmm...
So to answer your question, yes, they are different illnesses.
Oh, really...
Oh, but then again, colds and flus do share many common traits. I guess one could say a flu is sort of a "scaled-up" version of a cold after all.
I knew it!
Why are you looking so serious, huh?
Uh, it's nothin'. Just something that's been buggin' me since our conversation this morning.
Huh? The one about colds and flus?
You didn't disagree with me when I said I was stupid, did you?
Wait, it's not like that! I didn't mean...
Hello, come in.
She came by to visit.
Oh, thanks for coming to see her!
No worries, I'll just go up. Thanks!
Sure is cute when she's sleeping, isn't she? Okay, she's awake now.
How'd you get into my room?! What are you doing here?! Get out! Huh? You came by for a visit? All the way out here to see me?
Yup, that's right.
Oh no. I appreciate the thought, but I'd feel terrible if you caught this thing. Oh, this makes me so happy! She's all worried about me because of that new virus that's going around. I thought the only things she cared about were games and anime. But now... this is so touching! Huh?
'Kay, so uh, I'm gonna copy that homework we got the other day. But you don't have to get up, you cute little sleepy face you!
Out!
Hey! Someone's come over to visit you!
Okay!
May I come in?
Oh, I hope this isn't too much trouble.
Not at all. You should be resting though. Here's a little something.
Thank you. I'm feeling a lot better now. I took some medicine, so my fever is down.
Here.
Wow! You brought me flowers and fruit! You shouldn't have! Come on, sit down.
Oh, thank you, I will. I had thought of coming by to visit you with someone. Unfortunately, I just couldn't seem to find any time. I'm sorry.
No, really. It's fine!
Ah, I almost forgot. I brought you the minutes from the last committee meeting.
Oh, well, thank you!
Have a look at it when you can, but only when you're feeling up to it. There's no rush.
Hm.
There's that and I have the budget requests for each club here. What else was there, let me see now... let's see... Oh, but you're not feeling all right now! I should go home so you can rest.
Now, this is what a visit should be like!
What do you mean? What happened?
Well, you know how someone came by yesterday?
That's what happened.
Maybe that was just her funny little way of showing you she cared. Perhaps the bit with the homework was her attempt at cheering you up. And maybe she was trying not to wake you up, but couldn't help noticing you as you slept. And that would certainly explain how she saw you sleeping.
I never would've thought of it that way! Is this girl a saint or something?!
Oh, I just realized. I haven't seen her today.
Morning... Are you feeling any better today? You need anything?
Look at that. My sister isn't even sick and she's more relaxed than I am.
Well, it's not like I'm always sleeping in this late, really. Today's like "Spring Sleep Dawn" something or other. Oh! By the way, good morning!
Oh, I know how that is. Lately even I'm having trouble waking up in the morning.
Yeah, I know. And I've been so sleepy lately...
Me too. It's especially warm out today, so that doesn't help either.
Mm-hm, isn't it though?
You really can't help it.
Wasn't it warm a couple of days ago during our break?
It was.
When I woke up, it was just starting to get dark. I spent the whole day sleeping. Can you believe it?
It's a good thing if you can rest up when you have the day off.
Yeah, but the thing is, I was in my pajamas all day. Oh! Like today!
I had no idea those were your pajamas.
Oh yeah, they're my jammies!
I think they're adorable! Why, they don't even look like pajamas.
You think so?
Yes.
Do you think it's okay if I wear them all day?
I think you could even go outside in them.
I wonder...
Jeez, would someone get to the punchline already?
It's gone up a little... No, wait! The bra that I'm wearing has under-wires and extra padding. That's why I'm heavier today. Yeah, that's it, yeah. I wonder how much that is in grams? If I just subtract...
Huh... it's over! I totally screwed up! I forgot I had a physical exam today, so I wore my character-print underwear. I'm so embarrassed now!
I'm still short!
Heheh.
How dare you look happier than the rest of us, damn you!
Hey! I'm here now.
Oh, hiya.
I just thought of something. You always come here to hang out. What's the deal? Don't you have any friends from your own class?
Unlike you, I have friends. Are you trying to pick a fight?
No, I just thought they were avoiding you, is all.
Why don't you worry about yourself for a change, and get to work on those social skills?
Social skills? What are you talking about? See, even though I look like this, I've got about a hundred friends. Both my social and my bargaining skills are actually pretty high. Oh, and I go to parties every night.
Huh?
And with my allies, I strive to restore the light to the crystals, rescue the kidnapped princess and save the world from ruin.
Wait, you're talking about a game!
Oh yeah, I haven't seen that guy in a while...
What guy?
She's talking about one of her game buddies.
Hm, he's a warrior-class character, who wanted to improve his hand-to-hand combat skills. He left to train somewhere else where there's lots of monsters, but hasn't come back yet.
Oh.
I heard from someone else that he's camping out in one of the underground caverns. I wonder if he's all right though, being all cooped up down there like that? Everyone's worried about him.
How do you get cooped up in a game?
Trust me, it happens. I don't know, but by the looks of his login info, he's been playing the game nonstop for days.
Cooped up in the real world too, huh!
Whatever, it's the same guy in both worlds.
I always wanted to ask you guys this. How'd the two of you become friends, anyway?
Was about to be kidnapped by some big, suspicious foreign dude. I just happened along, saw what was goin' down and jumped in! I unloaded the Front Punch Whirlwind Kick combo attack on him and rescued her from that creep!
Why does everything you talk about revert back to gaming?
Hey, I was just doin' what any other skilled martial artist would've done, you know?
I don't approve the use of hasty violence, but you did save her.
The thing is that the foreigner was just asking me for directions. I couldn't understand what he was saying though and that's when she came by.
Wait, that's no good! How can you be so smug about it!
Oh, that's right. It's that time of year again, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
I just remembered that baseball season's starting soon.
Oh, do you not like watching sports and stuff? I sort of figured you'd love watching sports because you're so athletic.
If a game goes into extra innings, it's guaranteed to totally screw up the late-night programming schedule for anime! Or even worse, they could end up canceling the broadcast for that night.
It stinks when something you like disappears, doesn't it?
When do you eat the strawberry on top of a strawberry shortcake?
Why do you wanna know?
I was just wondering if you like to save your favorites for last.
I guess I save my favorite stuff for the last bite. Although with strawberries, it depends.
Beef tongue with green onions - you cook both sides?
Beef tongue with green onions? Hmm. It cooks pretty fast, but I guess if you roast it on both sides, it'll get done quicker.
You can't! The green onions fall off.
But you put the green onions on it after the meat's been cooked.
But if you do that, the onions won't get roasted.
But the green onions are just a topping, aren't they?
Man, you just don't get it at all...
Wait, maybe you can cook it both ways?
Oh, which end of a chocolate cornet is the head - is it the fat end or the skinny end?
Hmm. The fat end?
Wow, guess we agree on that.
Uh, you are kidding!
Okay, so which end do you eat first?
Hmm. Don't you tear off the thin end and dip it in the chocolate in the fat end?
Uh...
Hm.
Do you have any other friends besides us and the ones you have in video games?
Oh, yeah. I used to have this really good friend back in junior high school.
Oh, you actually had one.
Yeah, but I haven't talked to her in a while. I wonder what she's up to these days?
Oh...
You know, I remember in our junior high yearbook she wrote that her big dream in life was to become a mage.
So she was a geek too!
(cheerfully) Hiya, Luckies! It's time for the first-ever episode of Lucky Channel! So throw your hands up in the air and say, "Yay!" And a big hello to all the viewers tuning in! I'm Akira Kogami, and I'll be your navigator.
And, I'm Shiraishi.
Who's that? Just kidding! Allow me to introduce Minoru Shiraishi. He's gonna be my number one assistant! Dan-dan-dan-da~!
Yeah, well, I am Minoru Shiraishi, and I will be Akira-sama's assistant from now on. Howdy.
My my my! You're so tense, Shiraishi-san! Come on now, you're finally on TV. Loosen up, you big stick-in-the-mud, you! Kidding...
Sorry, I'm just not used to this.
I know it's only our first show, but we've already got bunches of letters from viewers just like you.
Okay, we got a letter here from a viewer in Osaka calling themselves "I love Berry-kou". Dear Lucky Channel, congratulations on your first-ever episode!
Thank you, thank you!
By the way, I've got a question for Akira-san. You are referred to as a "super idol" by everyone, including yourself. How much money do you make as an idol? Please tell me.
What I'm paid...?
Yes. You know, this question's kinda personal, so maybe we should move on.
(gruffly) Yeah, you know. What are you thinking asking a question like that?
A-Akira-sama...?
Well, it totally depends on the job. You know, some gigs are cheap. Some are really cheap. Either way, I get paid a flat fee from the production company, so who knows how much money those guys are skimmin' off the top. I've been in this business since I was three years old and every cent of my pay still gets direct-deposited into my parents' bank account. So all I get is a small allowance - and believe me, it's tiny. Oh, come to think of it, Mama has been buying a lot of brand-name bags lately. She couldn't be spending the money from this show already? You vampire! Just because Dad stopped sending money after the divorce, you're gonna suck me dry now, huh? What do you think I am? Some kind of Cinderella or something?
Oh, wait... Akira-sama... I don't think they wanted to know all that other stuff!
(cheerfully) Huh? Oh no! It's time for us to say good-bye, I'm so sad now! Please send us your questions and comments. If you guys have ideas or opinions about the show, or if you wanna tell me how much you love me, start sending those letters, 'kay? Is there anything you wanna add, Shiraishi-san?
Uh... right! So, I hope you guys tune in to see us next episode!
See ya! (gruffly) I heard they're giving you a part in the show. Is that right?
Huh? How'd you hear that?
Thanks for breakfast.
Can you help me with this problem?
If you can't figure it out, do you honestly think I could?
You're in college, aren't you?!
Do me a favor. Wake Tsukasa up.
No, she won't wake up for me.
Honey, wake up already!
Dad sure is late, isn't he?
Yeah, didn't he have a groundbreaking ceremony this morning?
Okay, Mom. What time is it?
I'm home.
It's past noon!
Hi, Dad! How was work?
Good morning...
It's afternoon.
How can you sleep for so long?
Did you see the special finale of Love Apron last night?
No, missed it.
I fell asleep in the middle.
You didn't see the end? I can't believe you slept through the end of it. This guy shows up out of nowhere with a red bucket on his head!
Kagami, Miyuki-chan's on the phone for you.
'Kay.
I was wondering if you'd like to get together to go over the answers on our homework?
Sure, that sounds like an awesome idea!
Kagami, Konata-chan's on the phone.
Yeah, so, do you wanna get together to go over all the answers to our homework?
Wait a minute! You're just gonna copy all my answers, aren't ya?!
'Kay, I'm here. Can I copy your homework now?
Man, talk about being blunt. Fine! You can copy my homework if you want, but if you don't do it on your own, you're still gonna blow that exam we have coming up after the break.
I guess you're right. In the long run, it's not gonna be good for me.
I'm good at pulling all-nighters before a test. So I'm down with the copying action.
Do you even have a conscience?!
Hello, everyone.
Oh, hi, Miyuki-san.
Hey, what's up?
Are you going to be studying with us as well, Izumi-san?
No, she's just gonna copy it. You're kidding me. Haven't either of you done your homework? Okay, what'd you guys do during the break?
Let's see...
I got 23 pages of math, 20 pages of world history, and 30 pages of English to do. I got a five-day break... If I study for five, no, four hours a day... Math takes 1.15 pages an hour...
Oh no, I haven't done any homework today! Let's see... I've got three days left, so I guess if I work... six hours a day?
Two more days... If I work all day and night...
Well, girls, Golden Week's almost over now. Were you two able to get done with all your homework and stuff?
Yeah, so do you wanna get together to go over all the answers to our homework?
I wanted to get everything done. I even had it planned out.
Your plans failed.
Your resistance was futile.
You're worse off than her!
Huh? At least she tried her best and did it on her own. No matter what anyone says, deep down, she's a hard worker. But her accuracy's horrible, I can't bear it. Horrible, just horrible!
So, were you guys able to have any fun during the short break? I know you had quite a lot of homework to do, and you also have that little midterm thing today. Don't tell me you spent the whole vacation goofing off instead of studying!
Ma'am, that didn't feel like a vacation at all!
Life's tough. I just kicked back and played around the whole time!
Oh, ma'am...
Yeah?
I kicked back and played around the whole time too!
Hey!
I always thought they designed these things so that you couldn't get the prizes.
Uh, kinda depends on the prize. Some of these are supposed to be hard to get.
Really?
Whatever, I never felt like trying it anyway.
Oh, amazing!
Yeah, this little guy is an easy one to grab.
Really?
If it's that easy to get one, maybe if I tried it...
"...I could get one too." Is that what you were thinking?
No! What are you talking about? I wasn't thinking anything! But I guess it couldn't hurt to just try this one time.
You know, you wanna try it...
Go for it, Sis. You can do it!
Darn! Thought I had that one for sure.
Oh, bummer.
Huh? Ah? Uhgh!... Shoot! No way! Why?!
A wise man once said that, "A UFO catcher's someone else's piggy bank."
True words of wisdom.
What... Oh, again... Oh no! I totally suck at this game. You've got really good rhythm, Kona-chan.
Nah, it doesn't have anything to do with rhythm. Rhythm, coordination, problem solving - the skills you get from gaming are useless in the real world.
Looking at you, I don't doubt that one bit.
Wow, you're super strong.
Yeah, I know...
How much money does she spend on these things?
Izumi! Hm? Has anyone seen Izumi today?
Hey, Miss Kuroi! I got a Miss Izumi on the line for ya.
Kuroi speaking. Why aren't you in class?
I'm sorry. I gotta take the day off. I'm not feeling too good.
That's unusual. Did you catch a cold or something?
No, it's just the May sickness is all...
Huh?
I feel sluggish you know.
Hurry up and get down here!
Hey! We're going home now. What's up, Konata? Why are you stuffing all those books in your bag?
The exams start tomorrow, and that means I gotta take all my books home tonight so I can cram till dawn.
You never take your books home to study? You leave them in here everyday? Unbelievable. Look, Konata, for one thing, there's no way you're gonna learn all that stuff the night before an exam!
Eh, I've always made it through exams doin' it this way.
You're confident. We'll see how long that attitude lasts you tomorrow.
Okay, I'm gonna return the exams you took the other day!
Oh...
Not too shabby. How'd you do?
Please don't ask, Sis... But I did the best I could, you know.
How about you, Little Miss All-nighter?
Totally passed it!
You aren't human, are ya?!
Blah... I don't feel like doing anything.
Come on! We're all going home. On the way home, you always end up hanging out with us anyway.
Oh, it's Comp-Fest! And they're gonna be giving out QUO Cards. I gotta collect them all! Right, time to get a part-time job!
You're talking out loud to yourself again.
That's crazy! I've never heard of anyone using a case of May sickness as an excuse before.
Oh, I understand where she's coming from though.
Well, they call it a sickness, so the excuse is totally legit, isn't it?
Do you honestly think that's true?
Yeah.
What exactly is the May sickness, anyway?
Miyuki, do you wanna explain it?
Well, by definition, May sickness happens after you've accomplished a major goal - such as a college entrance exam, or if you've just gotten a new job. It also happens when a relationship that started in April doesn't work out. Or when you can't reconcile the life you wanted versus the life you have. The symptoms include lethargy, apathy, and even a mild depression. You see, if you just feel lethargic, I don't think you can call that the May sickness.
Besides, all of us are still in the eleventh grade, so it doesn't even apply to us yet.
I like the change of pace in spring. I always do my best this time of year.
Oh, yeah. I guess I can see your point though. I tend to feel a little blah around this time of year too. I don't know, it's like sometimes I don't even feel like doing homework and stuff when I get home.
Yeah, I'm the same way!
I'm skipping the snide remark. I'm pooped!
What's wrong, Yuki-chan? Why are you sighing and stuff?
I'm a little embarrassed to talk about it; it's like my phobia about contact lenses. I'm afraid to go to the dentist, and I put it off for so long that my cavity's gotten worse. And now it's so bad that it hurts even when I drink water.
But, isn't that... sorta normal? I mean, I'm afraid of that too.
But if you knew it was gonna get this bad, then why didn't you take care of it earlier?
Huh?
Well, even though I knew it was going to be tough for me when my teeth started hurting...
For some reason, you still don't want to go to the dentist.
Even after the pain starts, you still don't wanna go anywhere near a dentist. You just put it off and try to bear it for as long as possible.
Are dentists really that scary? I've never had to deal with them, so I don't know.
You've never been to a dentist? I'm jealous.
There's that distinct medicine you smell in the office, and then the tension as you wait in the lobby.
I know, and the sound of those drills drilling away in the back!
Change Getter!
So scary!
Maybe guys like going to the dentists more than girls do.
Why's that?
Don't they say that a drill is kinda like a guy's...?
Dinosaur Empire! I hear guys go totally nuts for battles between robots that use drills for weapons!
Eh? Yeah, but I think they'd hate to have their teeth shaved off. Y'know what? When you go to the dentist, have you ever noticed how pretty all the dental assistants and receptionists are?
Come to think of it, they are.
I wonder why that would be?
Maybe the person hiring them has certain aesthetic standards.
Beautiful dental assistants and drills...
The way you put it, I agree, it does seem more geared towards men.
Then what do you think a dentist geared more for women would be like?
First thing they'd have to get rid of would be that medicine you smell.
And the chair they put you in should be one of those puffy reclining chairs with a massager in it!
Aromatherapy would be relaxing. Uh, and you could also have a foot massage at the same time.
That sounds good.
And if you were able to play games while they were drilling on you, that would help to ease the pain!
It might be hard to play games then...
But it is a good idea to have something to distract us.
Like putting on some headphones and listening to your favorite tunes.
Yeah, good one.
That's a great idea.
Mm-hmm.
But in the end, I still don't wanna go to the dentist.
Me neither...
What the...?!
Now what's wrong?
They're turning another one of my favorite series into an anime. But the cast is totally different from the one on the drama CD.
Really? I don't get what the big deal is.
Is this like an act of God or something? Politics? Money? What?
I never got into drama CDs, so I don't care who's in the cast. If the voices match the characters in the original series, I'm okay.
But that's not how it works, Kagamin! If you're used to listening to the drama CDs, it's weird when you start watching the anime and all the voices are different. See, it takes a long time before that weirdness goes away.
Huh?
But something good definitely comes out of news like this.
Yeah, like what?
Drama CDs and anime... You can enjoy two worlds with two different sets of voices. That's two for the price of one!
You're quite the tough shopper, aren't you?
Well, guys, looks like Miyuki-san's left a nugget on her plate. So it's up to us to figure out who's gonna get to eat it. How about we have a staring contest and the winner gets to eat it?
What? That is so childish.
That sounds fun. Come on, let's do it!
I think Kagami may have already won.
You say something?
Then let's begin the staring contest right now. Blah-blah!
Hahahaha... Tha... that was insane!
Amazing!
That doesn't even look human!
Jeez, you guys. Talk about overreacting.
I'm sorry I took so long. The bathroom was crowded. Did I miss something?
Come on, show Miyuki that crazy face you just made!
No, I don't want to.
It was amazing, Miyuki! You've never seen anything like this ever!
Fine.
Isn't that totally amazing!
It'll come in handy for the special talent section of your college application.
Yeah. Use it... use it to apply to college as I'm sure you'll get accepted!
Yeah, that's not really a compliment..
So I saw this report on TV about how many books the average Japanese person reads in a year. Anyway, they said manga wasn't good enough, and that only normal books counted.
Isn't manga...
I wonder if light novels would count?
Huh? I don't know... I guess it's okay if we counted light novels.
What about picture books?
Oh... Um... they're called books, so I guess they count?
If you said Harry Potter and books like that are ordinary, everyone who's into the fantasy genre would agree, right? So, is there such a thing as an "ordinary" book?
Umm...
Besides, they ended the whole report by saying something about how the younger generation is starting to turn away from printed media and stuff. The thing is, we use the net to look at all kinds of websites and blogs, so I think we actually read more stuff these days than ever before.
Yeah, I kinda get what you're saying, and kinda not...
Hey guys! Are you ready to go home?
Yeah, almost.
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't go home with you guys today.
Huh? What's the deal? Do you have to run an errand or something?
Mm. I started a part-time job, that's why.
Huh? Wait! She started a part-time job? Is the Comp-Fest that important to her?!
You know, I'm really surprised Konata actually went through with it.
Me too. She really got herself a part-time job. I thought she was just kidding about getting one.
Hmm... I wonder about it though...
Huh?
I'm more surprised by the fact that someone actually went and hired her.
That doesn't sound very nice!
Well, for one thing, I'm having a hard time picturing her being a diligent worker.
Good point, Sis.
I wonder where she ended up working?
Maybe she works at a bookstore? You know how she likes manga.
I wanna buy this.
Yeah, hang on a sec. I'm in the middle of something right now.
Bwha...?
Got 'em!
I really hope she doesn't get fired...
How about a convenience store?
I wanna buy this.
That'll be 498 yen please... Arigatog...... .........
Uh...?
Ehh... not there.
Maybe a fast-food place?
Got a problem with my smile?
Maybe not.
Family restaurants are also out of the question.
Welcome...
I wonder what kind of job she got?
Yeah...
Maybe she's a traffic monitor?
Nah.
A video rental place?
I don't know.
An Izakaya?
That's not it.
Pizza delivery?
No license.
Supermarket cashier?
Nope.
Cram school teacher?
You're kidding!
A bread factory?
Huh?
Let's see... Hmm...
Let's ask her tomorrow.
Hey, Konata. What kind of place are you working at?
Yeah, tell us!
Hmm? Oh, it's just your average cosplay cafe.
Ughh, that's perfect for her!
Should she be working there?
Hiya, Luckies! Second episode! It's me, Akira Kogami, your host! I hope you're all excited, 'cause I sure am! And sitting right next to me is a wonderful young man who's going to assist me on the show, Mr. Minoru Shiraishi.
I for-for-for... I'm Minoru Shiraishi, Akira-sama's assistant. I'm still really new at this, so all I'm hopin' for is that you guys remember my name. Yeah...
Clappity clap clap... Now we know it's just the second episode of Lucky Channel, but we've already got tons of messages from you guys. Yup! Tons and tons of messages! You guys are making me super happy. Thank you!
It's pretty amazing, isn't it? All this attention is because you're so popular, Akira-sama. Uh... what?
Saw the show today.
Yeah?
You were in it?
Huh?
The show, man. You had a part.
Oh. Yeah, they did give me a little part.
Yeah... They did, didn't they? Uh-huh? So, what was the scene you were in, anyway?
Sure, um... It was scene 45, part A - the classroom after vacation.
Right, right. Yeah, now, I remember... You came and went by so fast I'd almost forgotten.
Yeah, well, I only had one line in the scene, so I...
Nahh! You complaining or...!?
No! Nobody's complaining!
You should be thrilled those guys are giving a newbie like you a line in a scene. Things were different when I debuted on the screen...
Oh, really. How old were you when you made your debut?
Three years old. Back then I was ecstatic that they even gave me a crummy line. But it's not about how many lines you get after all.
Well, it was pretty tense for a while there, being surrounded by the biggest names in the industry. What an amazing experience!
Yeah, you were tense. I could tell.
Huh?
You were stiff as a board. You looked like a total amateur. Tell you what. I don't usually do this, but what the hell. Come on. Let's hit that scene together, you and me.
Uhh, you mean like right now?
They might bring you back for another episode, right?
Yeah, I guess.
Then, you have to practice your craft, man. Listen, I'm offering to help you out here!
No, yeah. I got it, I got it! Thank you, I really appreciate it.
The script, please. So, which scene was it?
The scene 45.
Oh yeah, this one. Okay. I'll play Kuroi, the teacher.
Whenever you're ready.
Ready and... action! "So, were you guys able to have any fun during the short break? I knowyou had a quie... q, qui, quiet...?
That's "quite".
...quite a lot of homework to do. You also got that little midterm thingy today. Don't tell me you spent the whole vacation goofing off instead of studying."
" Ma'am, that didn't feel like a vacation at all! "
What was that?!
What?
That totally sucked. There's no motivation - the line didn't deliver!
Deliver?
Deliver here, right here! I gotta feel it!
Oh, I'm sorry...
Hell, if you're just gonna say the line, a monkey can do that.
But, monkeys can't talk, ma'am, I...
Huh!?
Unyu? Hm... I guess it's time to say goodbye now. I think it's sad when happy times like this go by so fast, don't you? Well, anyway, keep on sending your questions and comments! And please don't forget me. I need to know you love me too, 'kay?
And we'll see all of you in the next episode.
See ya later! Bye bye, everybody!
Yeah, so... what do they like?
By "they" you mean...
The cast. Somebody's getting kicked off, yeah? They hate each other, right? Bunch of divas, right?
No, it's not like that. Everybody's pretty cool!
Then, why don't you help a girl out...?!
Amazing Kona-chan!
And what a passionate performance!
Hey, Konata! Are the next two songs gonna be like the last one?
I picked a couple of anime songs, with a few from some live-action shows.
That's not the point! Pick songs that the rest of us can recognize.
Hey, I can sing whatever I want. So chill out!
Fine, whatever. Hey, Tsukasa! Punch some songs into that thing or we'll be listening to her warbling anime vocals all night.
I don't mind if she does.
Actually, this is kind of fun.
Miyuki, not you too?!
Sorry if I block the screen, but I'm gonna do this one standing.
You really think that's gonna help?
It's harder if I'm sitting down 'cause I can't use my diaphragm.
You're gonna sing even louder than the last song?!
Hey, footage from the show.
Wow, look at that!
This looks like a TV show from way before we were born.
Okay ladies, here are your drinks.
Ah...thank you...
Ah, oolong tea?
That's me, thanks...
And the iced lemon tea?
Right here, please.
Uh, who had orange juice?
That's me.
And the ginger ale goes to?
O... oh... yeah... Just... ah... right there... thanks.
On the next episode of Lucky Star...
Kagami here! Okay, so when I put 200 yen in(to) a vending machine to buy a can of juice, and get back a 50-yen and some 10-yen coins as change, I think to myself, "Score!" But then, when I wanna buy a 150-yen ticket for the train, and after I put in a 100-yen coin, I think, "Oh, (what the...? I have/I've got five) 10-yen coins left!" So I put in four, (but I'm only on a half course?/but I only ever have four). So now I’m one short, so I end up putting in another hundred yen coin to buy the ticket, and then I get back nine 10-yen coins as change. And I feel so defeated, you know? Ugh! Next time -- "Various People".
Look forward to it.\NOkay, let's do this!
\NSure. Let's go!
\NGrr!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
\NOn your mark, get set...
Wow! Kona-chan,\Nthat was so amazing!
You're so good at sports,\Nand I always wondered,
how come you don't\Njoin a team or anything?
'Cause if I got on a team\Nand started playing sports,
I'd miss all of my\Nprime-time anime shows.
Hey, Tsukasa, which end of\Na choco-cornet do you eat first?
Huh? Um...
I think I start at the head.
Really?
So which side of this\Nthing's the head anyway?
The fat part,\Nor the skinny?
I always thought\Nthat this end of it,
the thin one was the head.
\NOh!
See, I always thought the\Nfatter end was the head.
So, why do you think the\Nthinner end's the head?
Doesn't it look like a seashell?
Why do you think\Nit's the fatter end?
I always thought, it looked\Nmore like a caterpillar.
\NA caterpillar?
Yeah, but when you\Nthink about it,
I guess a seashell's\Na much better image.
Um, you know...
There's another way to eat it.
Tear off the thin end
and dip it in the chocolate\Ncream on the fat end.
\NGood idea!
Ah! It figures you'd know that.
You're so smart, Miyuki-san!
Well, not really. Everyone has\Ntheir own way of eating one.
How about cream puffs?\NHow do you eat them?
Huh? How do I eat a cream puff?
That's easy. I split it\Nin half horizontally,
then I take the top half
and dip it into the cream\Nin the bottom part.
Then, after most of\Nthe cream is gone,
I start eating the bottom.
I find that if I\Neat it that way,
it keeps the cream\Nfrom spurting out,
and I have equal amounts of\Ncream and pastry in each bite.
Huh...
What do you do about the ones
that have both\Ncustard and cream?
Do you have a system\Nto eat those?
Do you mix the flavors together?
No, I don't have a system\Nfor those per se...
Wait, how exactly does\None mix the flavors?
Uh, just asking.
When do you eat the strawberry\Non a strawberry shortcake,
or a chestnut on top\Nof a Mont Blanc?
Let's see now...
It depends on the amount\Nof strawberries
that are sandwiched between\Nthe layers of sponge cake.
With the strawberries,
the whipped cream,\Nand the sponge cake,
I pace it so that I can get a\Nbit in each and every bite.
So getting to the strawberry\Non top of the cake
is always different for me.
Hmm. That's a solid move.
When I eat it, I always save\Nthe strawberry on top for last.
Sometimes I get so full\Nthat I can't eat it.
And other times,
someone in my family comes\Nalong and takes it away.
And that's why you should always\Neat your favorite part first.
Come to think, I've\Nnever seen anyone take
Kagami's strawberry\Naway from her.
That's Kagami for ya.\NShe's sharp.
Here's one. Can you eat the\Nvery last bite of an ice pop
without dropping it?
Wait, you drop it?
If you don't eat it\Nthe right way...
...it falls off, doesn't it?
Yes.
How you do it,\NKona-chan?
I suck it off the stick.
Oh...
Or maybe you could\Njust turn it around
while you eat it, like this.
Oh, that's a good idea.
And then there's\Nsoft-serve ice cream,
which I'm not very fond of.
Huh? Whats wrong with it?
I hate how you're always left
with an empty cone\Nat the end of it.
You're right! There's never any\Nice cream left, just the cone.
I always try\Nto push the ice cream
further and further down\Ninto the cone as I eat.
But how in the world\Ndo you do that?
While I eat, l do a\Npush and shove thing.
A push and shove thing?
You try to balance\Neverything out, don't you?
I suppose.
Oh, here's another one.
How do you eat curried rice?
Do you mix the curry\Nwith the rice?
No, but I do try to\Nhave equal amounts
of curry and rice left\Nover for my last bite.
I like mixing it up.\NHow do you eat it?
It all depends on the curry.
If I pour some sauce on it,\Nor drop a raw egg on top,
then I mix it up.
You put sauce on curry?
Oh, yeah, it's tasty.
Do you put\Nsauce on fried eggs too?
Nope, I put soy\Nsauce on fried eggs.
Oh! See, when I use that,\NI use mayonnaise.
Mayonnaise on fried eggs\Nbut not on hard-boiled eggs?
Mh-hm.
You know mayonnaise is good\Nwith pretty much every egg dish.
You put it on curry too?
Mh-hm.
I put mayo on white\Nrice and on beef bowls.
It goes good with\Nthat sweet broth.
Oh! And on\Nparent-child bowls too!
You know how the chicken's the\Nparent and the egg's the child?
And how mayonnaise is\Nmade from eggs too?
I just put a little\Nblob of it on top
and I call that\Nthe Relative Bowl.
\NHmm.
And I used to really\Nhate natto beans,
but if I put some mayonnaise\Non 'em, I can eat 'em.
Ach, I can't imagine that.
Oh, but the tastiest\Nthing has to be
when you put mayonnaise right\Non top of some soft-boiled eggs.
Even the fried eggs are\Nhalf-cooked at my house.
Really?
Yep. That's just how\Nmy dad likes his eggs.
I guess it's because he always\Nliked to suck on the yolk.
So, if you fry the egg too much,\Nthen the yolk gets too hard
and my dad can't\Nsuck the yolk out.
So, how do you eat\Nchicken skewers?
What do you mean "how"?
Do you eat it\Nright off the skewer?
Or do you pull it\Noff with chopsticks?
Let me see.
When I'm alone, I'll\Neat it off the skewer.
but when I'm eating in\Npublic, or with company,
I'll use chopsticks\Nto pull it off.
Yeah! And don't you feel weird
when there's only one\Npiece left on the plate?
Yes, the last bite
certainly makes things\Nawkward at the table.
And then it gets later and\Nlater and no one eats it.
It gets all dry and stale\Nand it's not lookin' so tasty,
and no one really\Nwants to eat it,
but they don't want\Nto say anything,
and then the waiter comes\Nover to take the plate
and you're like, "Woah,\Nwe're still eating that!"
In the end, we all go home\Nwithout eating that last bite.
Oh, that's such a waste.
I feel sorry for it...
Oh! With Korean barbecue,
I feel sorry for the meat\Nthat's left on the grill
that turns to charcoal.
Well, at a Korean barbecue,
you're always eating and\Nchatting at the same time,
so you get a little distracted.
And when you're grilling beef\Ntongue with green onions,
that cooks really fast.
Oh, you're so right.\NIt's already done cooking
by the time you flip\Nit over, isn't it?
Wait, you flip it over?
Huh?
You flip it over?
You should never flip beef\Ntongue with green onions.
Why shouldn't I flip it?
'Cause if you flip it over,
all the green onions on top\Nwill fall into the grill!
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You don't need to\Nflip it over at all
You roast it on one side,
and the heat cooks\Nit all the way through.
I get it. I guess I'll\Ndo that from now on.
You absolutely,\Npositively never flip it.
Never flip it.
Ever.
Ohh...
Oh, which end of a\Nchoco-cornet is the head?
The fat end or the skinny end?
\NSuch a bad boy!
What's with all the\Nkidnappings lately?
I mean, these guys\Nimprison girls
and force them to call\Nthem "Master" and stuff.
It's sick.
Oh...
I think it's about guys\Nplaying way too many
dating sims and erotic games.\NThe master/slave thing
is a pretty common\Nscenario, ya know.
Oh yeah, like you'd\Nknow all about that.
Wait, you're in the\Neleventh grade.
How do you know about\Nerotic game scenarios?!
\NLucky Star!
\NYou're amazing.
You're always at\Nthe top of the class.
\NHuh?
Don't you have\Nany faults, Miyuki-san?
It's a little embarrassing,
but I guess I tend to think\Nabout things too much.
So much that I end\Nup spacing out.
I Sometimes cut my finger\Nusing the veggie slicer,
Sometimes, I'll trip on\Nmy feet and fall down.
Or a corner of my tote bag will\Nget caught in the train's door.
Wow.
Woah, hold it. Miyuki-san,\Nthose aren't called faults,
People call those moe points!
Huh? Moe points?
Clumsy is sexy.
\NKona-chan,
what have you been\Nthinking this whole time?
How come you wear glasses?\NI mean, you're really pretty,
but you can only appeal to a\Ntiny section of the fan base.
Ha. Appeal to.
Besides the whole\Npopularity thing,
don't glasses actually\Nmake your vision worse?
How come you never switch\Nto wearing contacts?
Well, it's a little\Nembarrasing to admit
now that I'm in high school,\Nbut I suppose you could say...
...I'm afraid of contact lenses!
Actually, I'm pretty scared\Nto put anything into my eyes.
I can't even open\Nmy eyes underwater.
\NDamn, she's a natural airhead.
A total cutie pie!
Hey, isn't that\NMiyuki-san over there?
Huh?
\NI wonder if she broke down
and decided to\Nget some contacts.
I guess\Nshe's probably better off
with the glasses after all.
\NThat must've hurt.
\NAnd she's like that naturally.
Kagami's staying home 'cause\Nshe's got a cold, huh?
Mh-hm.
But at least she's only got a\Ncold and not the flu, you know?
Thankfully, I'm stupid,
so I dont have to worry\Nabout catchin' flus and stuff.
I heard that\Nworks with a cold
but I didn't know it was\Nthe same for the flu.
I thought the flu was\Nthe deluxe version of the cold.
You saying that colds and\Nflus are two different things?
I-I guess I think\Nthey're different things.
Or maybe the aren't.
I dont know anymore.\NI'm kinda confused now.
Oh! The difference between\Ninfluenza and a cold?
Mm, mm.
Let's me see now...
Influenza is a viral illness,
with many symptoms such\Nas fever and muscle aches.
If it's not treated,
there's a risk of more\Nserious complications.
On the other hand,\Nthe symptoms of a cold
are sore throat\Nand a runny nose,
and the fever\Ndoesn't run as high.
Those are just a few\Nof the symptoms
that differ from the flus.
Huh...
So, to answer your question,
yes, they are\Ndifferent illnesses.
Oh, really...
Oh, but then again,
colds and flus do share\Nmany common traits.
I guess one could say a flu\Nis sort of a scaled-up version
of a cold, after all.
I knew it!
Hmm...
Why are you looking so\Nserious, huh, Kona-chan?
Ah, it's nothin', just somethin'\Nthat's been bugging me
since our conversation\Nthis morning.
Huh? The one about\Ncolds and flus?
You didn't disagree with me
when I said I was stupid,\Ndid you Tsukasa--?
Wait, It's not like that!\NI didn't mean--
\NHello, Konata-chan. Come in.
\NShe came by to visit Sis.
Oh, thanks\Nfor coming to see her.
No worries,\NI'll just go up. Thanks!
Haha, Kagami sure\Nis cute when she's sleeping,
isnt she?
How'd you get into my room? What\Nare you doing here? Get out!
Huh? You came\Nby for a visit?
All the way out here to see me?
Yup, that's right.
Oh, no. I appreciate the thought
but I'd feel terrible\Nif you caught this thing.
\NOh, this makes me so happy.
She's all worried about me
because of that new virus\Nthat's going around.
I thought the only things\Nshe cared about
were games and anime.
But now, this is so touching.
\NHm?
'Kay, so, uh, I'm gonna\Ncopy that homework
we got the other day.
But you don't have to get up,
you cute little\Nsleepy face, you.
\NOut!
\NKagami!
Miyuki-chan's come\Nover to visit you!
Okay.
May I come in?
Oh, I hope this isn't\Ntoo much trouble.
Not at all, you should\Nbe resting though.
-Here's a little something.\N--Thank you.
I'm feeling a lot better now.
I took some medicine,\Nso my fever's down.
--Here.\N--Wow!
You brought me flowers and\Nfruit! You shouldn't have!
Come on, sit down.
Oh.Thank you. I will.
I had thought of coming by\Nto visit you with Izumi-san.
Unfortunately, I just couldn't\Nseem to find any time.
I'm sorry.
No, really, it's fine.
Ah! I almost forgot,
I brought you the minutes from\Nthe last committee meeting.
Oh. Well, thank you!
Have a look at it when you can,
but only when you're feeling\Nup to it. There's no rush.
\NMm.
There's that,
and I have the budget\Nrequests for each club here.
What else was there?\NLet me see now...
Let's see...
Oh, but you're not\Nfeeling well right now!
I should go home\Nso you can rest.
Now this is what a\Nvisit should be like!
What do you mean? What happened?
Well, you know how\NKonata came by yesterday?
That's what happened.
Maybe that was just\NIzumi-san's funny little way
of showing you she cared.
Perhaps the bit with the\Nhomework was her attempt
at cheering you up, Kagami-san.
And maybe she was trying\Nnot to wake you up,
but couldn't help\Nnoticing you as you slept.
And that would certainly explain\Nhow she saw you sleeping.
I never would've\Nthought of it that way!
Is this girl a saint\Nor something?
Oh, I just realized,
I haven't seen\NTsukasa-san today.
Morning.
Are you feeling any better\Ntoday, Sis? You need anything?
Look at that.
My sister isn't even sick and\Nshe's more relaxed than I am.
Well, it's not like I'm\Nalways sleeping in this late.
Really! Today's like "spring\Nsleep dawn" something or other.
Oh! By the way, good morning!
Oh, I know how that is.
Lately, even I'm having trouble\Nwaking up in the morning.
Yeah, I know, and I've\Nbeen so sleepy lately.
Me too. It's especially\Nwarm out today,
so that doesn't help either.
Isn't it though?
You really can't help it.
Wasn't it warm a couple\Ndays ago during our break?
It was
When I woke up, it was\Njust starting to get dark.
I spent the whole day sleeping.\NCan you believe it?
It's a good thing\Nif you can rest up
when you have the day off.
Yeah, but the thing is,\NI was in my pajamas all day!
Oh! Like today.
I had no idea those\Nwere your pajamas?
Oh, yeah, there my jammies!
I think they're adorable!
Why, they don't even\Nlook like pajamas.
--You think so?\N--Yes.
Do you think it's okay\Nif I wore them all day?
I think you could even\Ngo outside in them.
Jeez, would someone\Nget to the punch line already?
\NIt's gone up a little.
No, wait!
The bra that I'm wearing has\Nunderwires and extra padding!
That's why I'm heavier today!
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
I wonder how much\Nthat is in grams.
If I just subtract...
\NIt's over. I totally screwed up!
I forgot I had a\Nphysical exam today,
so I wore my\Ncharacter-print underwear.
I'm so embarrassed now!
\NI'm still short.
How dare you look happier\Nthan the rest of us! Damn you!
Hey! I'm here, now.
Oh, hiya' Sis.
I Just thought of something.
You always come\Nhere to hang out.
What's the deal?
Don't you have any friends\Nfrom your own class?
Unlike you, I have friends.
Are you picking a fight?
No, I just thought they were\Navoiding you, is all.
Why don't you worry about\Nyourself for a change
and get to work on\Nthose social skills?
Social skills?\NWhat're you talking about?
See, even though\NI look like this,
I've got about a\Nhundred friends.
Both my social and my bargaining\Nskills are actually pretty high.
Oh, and I go to\Nparties every night.
Huh?
And with my allies,
I strive to restore the\Nlight to the crystals,
rescue the kidnapped princess,
and save the world from ruin!
Wait, you're talking\Nabout a game!
Oh yeah, I haven't seen\Nthat guy in while.
What guy?
She's talking about one\Nof her game buddies.
Mm. He's a warrior\Nclass character,
who wanted to improve his\Nhand-to-hand combat skills.
He left to train somewhere else\Nwhere's there lots of monsters,
but hasn't come back yet.
I heard from someone else\Nthat he's camping out
in one of the\Nunderground caverns.
I wonder if he's\Nall right though,
being all cooped up\Ndown there like that.
Everyone's worried about 'im.
How do you get\Ncooped up in a game?
Trust me, it happens.
I don't know, but by the\Nlooks of his login info,
he's been playing the game\Nnon-stop for days.
Cooped up in the\Nreal world too, huh?
Whatever, its the same\Nguy in both worlds.
I always wanted to\Nask you guys this,
how'd the two of you\Nbecome friends, anyway?
Tsukasa was\Nabout to be kidnapped
by some big suspicious\Nforeign dude.
I just happened along, saw what\Nwas going down and jumped in!
I unloaded a front punch,
whirlwind kick\Ncombo attack on him
and rescued her\Nfrom that creep.
Why does\Neverything you talk about
revert back to gaming?
Hey, I was just doin'\Nwhat any other
skilled martial artist\Nwould've done, you know?
I don't approve the\Nuse of hasty violence,
but you did save her.
The thing is that the foreigner
was just asking\Nme for directions,
I couldn't understand what\Nhe was saying though
and that's when\NKona-chan came by.
Wait, that's no good! How can\Nyou be so smug about it?!
Oh, that's right. It's that time\Nof the year again, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
I just remembered that\Nbaseball season's starting soon.
Oh, do you not like watching\Nsports and stuff, Kona-chan?
I sorta figured you'd\Nlove watching sports
because you're so athletic.
If a game goes into extra\Ninnings, it's guaranteed
to totally screw up
the late-night programming\Nschedule for anime.
Or even worse,
they could end up cancelling\Nthe broadcast for that night.
It sucks when something you\Nlike disappears, doesn't it?
When do you\Neat the strawberry
on top of a strawberry\Nshortcake?
Why do you want to know?
I was just wondering
if you liked to save\Nyour favorites for last?
I guess I save my favorite\Nstuff for the last bite.
Although with strawberries,\Nit depends.
Beef tongue with green onions,\Nyou cook both sides?
Beef tongue with green onions?
Hmm. It cooks pretty fast,
but i guess if you\Nroast it on both sides,
it'll get done quicker.
You can't! The green\Nonions fall off.
But you put the\Ngreen onions on it
after the meat's been cooked.
But if you do that, the\Nonions won't get roasted.
But the green onions are\Njust a topping, aren't they?
Man, you just don't\Nget it at all.
Wait, maybe you can\Ncook it both ways.
Oh!
Which end of a choco-cornet\Nis the head?
Is it the fat end,\Nor the skinny end?
Hmm. The fat end?
Wow. Guess we agree on that.
You're kidding.
Okay, so which end\Ndo you eat first?
Hm. Don't you tear\Noff the thin end
and dip it in the\Nchocolate in the fat end?
Do you have any other friends,
besides us and the ones that\Nyou have in video games?
Oh, yeah, I used to have\Nthis really good friend
back in junior high school.
\NOh, you actually had one.
Yeah, but I haven't\Ntalked her in a while.
I wonder what she's\Nup to these days?
You know, I remember in\Nour junior high year book,
she wrote that her big dream\Nin life was to become a mage--
So, she was a geek too!
\NLucky Star!
\NLucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
It's time for the first ever\Nepisode of Lucky Channel!
So throw your hands up\Nin the air and say "yay!"
And a big hello to all\Nthe viewers tunning in!
I'm Akira Kogami, and\NI'll be your navigator!
And... I'm Shiraishi.
Who's that?
Just kidding!
Allow me to introduce\NMinoru Shiraishi.
He's going to be my\Nnumber one assisstant!
Ta-da-da-da!
Yeah, well, I am\NMinoru Shiraishi,
and I will be Akria-sama's\Nassistant from now on.
Howdy.
My, my, my! You're so\Ntense, Shiraishi-san!
Come on now, you're\Nfinally on TV!
Loosen up you big\Nstick in the mud, you!
Sorry, I'm just\Nnot used to this.
I know it's only our first show,\Nbut we've already got
bunches of letters from\Nviewers just like you!
Okay! We got a letter\Nhere from a viewer
in Osaka calling themselves\N"I Love Berry-Kou."
"Dear, Lucky Channel,\Ncongratulations
--on your first ever episode."\N--Thank you, Thank you!
"By the way, I've got a\Nquestion for Akira-san.
You are referred to as a\NSuper Idol by everyone,
including yourself.
How much money do you make\Nas an idol? Please tell me."
What I'm paid?
Yes.
You know, this question's\Nkinda personal,
so maybe we should move one.
Yeah, you know,
what are you thinking\Nasking a question like that?
A-Akira-sama?
Well, it totally\Ndepends on the job.
You know, some gigs are cheap.
Some are really cheap,
Either way, I get paid a flat\Nfee from the production company.
So, who knows how much money
those guys are\Nskimming off the top.
I've been in this business\Nsince I was three-years-old,
and every cent of my pay\Nstill gets direct deposited
into my parent's bank account.
So, all I get is\Na small allowance,
and, believe me, it's tiny.
Uh. Come to think of it,
Mama's been buying a lot\Nof brand-name bags lately.
She couldn't be spending the\Nmoney from this show already.
You vampire!
Just because Dad stopped\Nsending money after the divorce,
you're going to suck\Nme dry now, huh?!
What do you think I am?!
Some kind of Cinderella,\Nor something?!
Huh? Oh, no, it's time\Nfor us to say goodbye!
I'm so sad now!
Please send us your\Nquestions and comments.
If you guys have idea or\Nopinions about the show,
or if you want to tell me\Nhow much you love me,
start sending\Nthose letters, 'kay'?
Is there anything you want\Nto add, Shiraishi-san?
Uh, right. So, I hope you guys\Ntune in to see us next episode.
See ya!
I heard they're\Ngiving you a part in the show.
Is that right?
\NHuh? Where'd you hear that?
We don't\Nkaraoke together enough.
\NTo tell you the truth,
I hardly ever go to\Nplaces like this.
Come on,\Nwe've only got two hours,
so start singing, people!
\NStop being so pushy!
Two hours is plenty of time.
I have to say,\Nthis sure is exciting.
\NIt's so fun!
I like how after you sing,\Nyou feel really good.
\NAnyone see the catalog?
\NCatalog?
\NYeah, the catalog.
\NThe catalog?
You know, the thing\Nwith all the song numbers in it.
\NYou mean this?
\NRight on! I'm going first!
Hang on... Wait,\Nyou just entered three songs?!
Yeah! It's way\Nbetter if you load it up!
\NWhat song is this?
\NSpace Iron-Men Kyoudain!
Ohh! We gotta start\Nwith this one.
\NI don't know this one.
\NGo for it, Kona-chan!
\NKonata-chan, this is too loud!
Turn down the volume!
How the hell does she\Nknow a song like this?
On the next\Nepisode of Lucky Star.
\NKonata here. I'm so sleepy.
How come on nights\Nwhen you slept a lot,
you wake up even sleepier\Nthe next morning?
Kinda defeats the purpose
of gettin' a good night's\Nsleep, doesn't it?
Next time:\N"Efforts and Results."
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay, let's do this!
\NSure, let's go!
\NGrr!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
\NIt's so stinky, y'know!
Stinky!
Well girls,\NGolden Week's almost over now,
were you two able to get done
with all your\Nhomework and stuff?
Um, I haven't finished yet.
You know how you just wanna\Nplay during these long holidays.
We're in trouble...\Naren't we, Sis?
Sorry, but I'm almost\Ndone with my homework.
But we've been\Nplaying this whole time...
Thanks for breakfast.
Can you help me\Nwith this problem?
If you can't figure it out,\Ndo you honestly think I could?
You're in college, aren't you?!
Do me a\Nfavor and wake Tsukasa up.
No... She won't\Nwake up for me.
\NHoney, wake up already.
Dad sure is\Nlate, isn't he?
Yeah, didn't he have
a groundbreaking\Nceremony this morning?
Okay, Mom.\NWhat time is it?
--I'm home.\N--It's past noon!
Hi, Dad!\NHow was work?
\NGood morning...
It's afternoon.
How can you sleep for so long?
Did you see the special finale\Nof Love Apron last night?
No. Missed it.
I fell asleep in the middle...
You didn't see the end?
I can't believe you slept\Nthrough the end of it!
This guy shows up outta nowhere\Nwith a red bucket on his head!
--Kagami...\N--Mm?
Miyuki-chan's\Non the phone for you!
'Kay!
I was wonder if you'd\Nlike to get together
to go over the answers\Non our homework.
Sure. That sounds\Nlike an awesome idea.
Kagami,\NKonata-chan's on the phone!
Yeah, so, do you\Nwanna get together
to go over all the answers\Nto our homework?
Wait a minute! You're just gonna\Ncopy all my answers, aren't ya?
'Kay, I'm here. Can I\Ncopy your homework now?
Man, talk about being blunt...
Fine! You can copy\Nmy homework if you want,
but if you don't do it on\Nyour own, you're still gonna
blow that exam we have\Ncoming up after the break.
I guess you're right...
In the long run, it's not\Ngonna be good for me.
I'm good at pulling\Nall-nighters before a test,
so I'm down with\Nthe copying action.
Do you even have a conscience?!
Hello, everyone.
--Oh, hi, Miyuki.\N--Hey, what's up?
Are you going to be studying\Nwith us as well, Izumi-san?
No, she's just gonna copy it.
You're kidding me?!
Haven't either of you\Ndone your homework?
Okay... What'd you guys\Ndo during the break?
--Let's see...\N--Hmm...
Hmm... I got 23 pages of math,\N20 pages of world history,
and 30 pages of English to do...
I got a five-day break...
If I study for five,\Nno, four hours a day...
Math takes 1.15 pages an hour...
Oh, no, I haven't done\Nany homework today.
Let's see...\NI got three days left,
so I guess if I work\Nsix hours a day...?
--\N--
\NTwo more days...
If I work all day and night...
Well girls,\NGolden Week's almost over now,
were you two able to get done
with all your\Nhomework and stuff?
Yeah, so, do you\Nwanna get together to
go over all the answers\Nto our homework?
I wanted to get everything done.\NI even had it planned out.
Your plans failed.
Your resistance was futile.
You're worse off than her!
At least she tried her\Nbest and did it on her own.
No matter what anyone says,\Ndeep down, she's a hard worker.
But her accuracy's\Nhorrible. I can't bear it.
Horrible...\Njust horrible...
So, were you guys able to have\Nany fun during the short break?
I know you had quite a\Nlot of homework to do,
and you also have that\Nlittle midterm thing today.
Don't tell me you spent the\Nwhole vacation goofing off,
instead of studying!
Man, that didn't feel\Nlike a vacation at all!
Life's tough.
I just kicked back and\Nplayed around the whole time!
Uh, Ma'am...
Yeah?
I kicked back and played\Naround the whole time, too!
Hey!
I always thought they\Ndesigned these things
so that you couldn't\Nget the prizes.
Eh, kinda depends on the prize.
Some of these are supposed\Nto be hard to get.
Really?
Whatever, I never felt\Nlike trying it anyway.
\NOh, amazing!
Yeah, this little guy's\Nan easy one to grab.
Really...
If it's that easy to\Nget one, maybe if I tried it...
\N"...I could get one, too,"
is that what you were thinking?
No! What are you talking about?\NI wasn't thinking anything!
But I guess it couldn't hurt\Nto just try this one time.
Go for it, Sis. You can do it!
Darn. I thought I had\Nthat one for sure.
Oh, bummer.
\NNo way!
Why?!
A wise man once said that:
"A UFO catcher's someone\Nelse's piggy bank."
\NTrue words of wisdom.
What? Oh! Again?
Oh, no....
I totally suck at this game.
You've got really good\Nrhythm, Kona-chan.
Nah, it doesn't have\Nanything to do with rhythm.
Rhythm, coordination,\Nproblem-solving,
the skills you get from gaming\Nare useless in the real world.
Looking at you, I don't\Ndoubt that one bit.
Wow, you're super strong.
Yeah, I know.
How much money does\Nshe spend on these things?
Izumi! Hm?
Has anyone seen Izumi today?
Hey, Miss Kuroi? I got a\NMiss Izumi on the line for ya.
Kuroi speaking.\NWhy aren't you in class?
I'm sorry.\NI gotta take the day off.
I'm not feeling too good.
That's unusual. Did you\Ncatch a cold or something?
Nah, it's just\Nthe May sickness is all.
I feel sluggish, you know.
Hurry up and get down here!
Hey, we're going home now.
What's up, Konata?
Why are you stuffing all\Nthose books in your bag?
The exam's start tomorrow,
and that means I gotta take\Nall my books home tonight,
so I can cram till dawn.
You never take your\Nbooks to study?
You leave them here every day?
Unbelievable. Look, Konata,\Nfor one thing, there's no way
you're gonna learn all that\Nstuff the night before an exam.
Eh, I've always made it through\Nexams doin' it this way.
You're confident.
We'll see how long that\Nattitude lasts you tomorrow.
Okay, I'm gonna return the\Nexams you took the other day.
\NNot too shabby.
How'd you do?
Please don't ask, Sis, but I did\Nthe best I could, ya know?
How 'bout you, little\Nmiss all-nighter?
Totally passed it.
You aren't human, are ya?!
\NLucky Star!
Blah... I don't\Nfeel like doin' anything.
Come on, we're all going home.
On the way home, you always end\Nup hanging out with us anyway.
Oh, it's Comp-Fest!
And they're gonna be\Ngivin' out QUO Cards.
I gotta collect 'em all.
Right! Time to get\Na part-time job!
You're talking out loud\Nto yourself again.
That's crazy. I've never\Nheard of anyone using
a case of May sickness\Nas an excuse before.
I understand where she's\Ncoming from though.
Well, they call it a sickness,
so the excuse is\Ntotally legit, isn't it?
Do you honestly\Nthink that's true?
--Yeah.\N--Ah...
What exactly is the\NMay sickness anyway?
Miyuki, you wanna explain it?
Well...
By definition, May sickness\Nhappens after you've
accomplished a major goal,\Nsuch as a college entrance exam.
Or if you've just\Ngotten a new job.
It also happens\Nwhen a relationship
that started in April\Ndoesn't work out,
or when you can't reconcile\Nthe life you wanted
versus the life you have.
The symptoms include\Nlethargy, apathy,
and even a mild depression.
You see, if you\Njust feel lethargic,
I don't think you can call\Nthat the May sickness.
Besides, all of us are\Nstill in the eleventh grade,
so it doesn't even\Napply to us yet.
I like the change\Nof pace in spring.
I always do my best\Nthis time of year.
Oh, yeah.
I guess I can see\Nyour point, though.
I tend to feel a little blah\Naround this time of year, too.
I dunno, it's like sometimes\NI don't even feel like
doing homework and\Nstuff when I get home.
Yeah, I'm the same way!
I'm skipping\Nthe snide remark, I'm pooped.
--\N--
What's wrong, Yuki-chan?\NWhy are you sighing and stuff?
I'm a little embarrassed\Nto talk about it,
It's like my phobia\Nabout contact lenses.
I'm afraid to go to the dentist,\Nand I've put it off for so long,
that my cavity's gotten worse.
And now it's so bad that it\Nhurts even I drink water.
But... isn't that...\Nsorta normal?
I mean, I'm afraid of that, too.
But if you knew it was\Ngonna get this bad,
then why didn't you take\Ncare of it earlier?
Well, even though I knew it\Nwas going to be tough for me
when my teeth\Nstarting hurting...
For some reason, you still\Ndon't want to go to the dentist.
Even after the pain starts,
you still don't want to go\Nanywhere near a dentist,
you just put it off and try to\Nbear it for as long as possible.
Are dentists really that scary?
I've never had to deal\Nwith them, so I don't know.
You've never been to a dentist?\NI'm jealous!
There's that distinct medicine\Nyou smell in the office,
and then the tension as\Nyou wait in the lobby.
I know! And the sound\Nof those drills
drilling away in the back!
\NChange Getter!
So scary!
Maybe guys like going to the\Ndentist more than girls do.
Why's that?
Don't they say that a drill\Nis kinda like a guy's...
\NDinosaur Empire!
I hear guys go totally nuts\Nfor battles between robots
that use drills for weapons!
Yeah, but I think they'd hate\Nto have their teeth shaved off.
Know what? When you\Ngo to the dentist,
have you ever noticed how pretty
all the dental assistants\Nand receptionists are?
Come to think of it, they are.
I wonder why that would be.
Maybe the person hiring them has\Ncertain aesthetic standards.
Beautiful dental\Nassistants and drills...
The way you put it, I agree,
it does seem more\Ngeared towards men.
Then, what do you think a\Ndentist geared more for women
would be like?
First thing they'd\Nhave to get rid of
would be that medicine-y smell.
And the chair they\Nput you in should be
one of those puffy, reclining\Nchairs with a massager in it.
Aromatherapy would be relaxing.
And you could also have a foot\Nmassage at the same time!
That sounds good!
And, if you were able\Nto play games while
they were drilling on you, that\Nwould help to ease the pain.
It might be hard\Nto play games then.
But it is a good idea to have\Nsomething to distract us.
Like putting on some headphones,
and listening to your\Nfavorite tunes.
Yeah, good one!
That's a great idea!
Mm-hm!
But in the end, I still\Ndon't want to go to the dentist.
\NMe neither.
What the...?!
Now, what's wrong?
They're turning another\None of my favorite series
into an anime, but the\Ncast is totally different
from the one on the drama CD.
Really? I don't get\Nwhat the big deal is.
Is this like an act\Nof God or something?
Politics? Money? What?
I never got into drama CDs, so\NI don't care who's in the cast.
If the voices match\Nthe characters
in the original\Nseries, I'm okay.
But that's not how\Nit works, Kagamin!
If you're used to listening to\Nthe drama CDs, it's weird when
you start watching the anime and\Nall the voices are different.
See, it takes a long time before\Nthat weirdness goes away.
Huh?
But something good definitely\Ncomes outta news like this.
Yeah? Like what?
Drama CDs and anime.
You can enjoy two worlds with\Ntwo different sets of voices.
That's two for the price of one!
You're quite the tough\Nshopper, aren't you?
Well, guys, looks like\NMiyuki-san's left a nugget
on her plate, so it's\Nup to us to figure out
who's gonna get to eat it.
How 'bout we have\Na staring contest,
and the winner gets to eat it?
What? That is so childish.
That sounds fun!\NCome on, let's do it!
I think Kagamin may\Nhave already won.
You say something?
Then let's begin the staring\Ncontest, right now! Buh-blah!
\NT-That's insane!
\NAmazing!
\NThat didn't even look human!
Jeez, you guys, talk\Nabout overreacting...
I'm sorry I took so\Nlong, the bathroom was crowded.
Did I miss something?
Come on, show Miyuki that\Ncrazy face you just made.
\NNo, I don't want to.
It was amazing, Miyuki!
You've never seen\Nanything like this, ever!
\NFine...
\NIsn't that totally amazing?
It'll come in handy for\Nthe special talent section
of your college applications!
Yeah, use it! Use it\Nto apply to colleges.
I'm sure you'll get accepted!
Yeah... that's not\Nreally a compliment.
So I saw this report on TV about
how many books the average\NJapanese person reads in a year.
Anyway, they said manga\Nwasn't good enough,
and that only normal\Nbooks counted.
Isn't manga...
I wonder if\Nlight novels would count.
Huh? I don't know...
I guess it's okay if you\Ncounted light novels.
What about picture books?
Uhh... Mm.
They're called books,\Nso I guess they'd count?
If you said Harry Potter and\Nbooks like that are ordinary,
everyone who's into the fantasy\Ngenre would agree, right?
So, is there such a thing\Nas an "ordinary" book?
Besides, they ended the whole\Nreport by saying something
about how the younger generation
is starting to turn away from\Nprinted media and stuff.
The thing is, we use the net
to look at all kinds of\Nwebsites and blogs,
so, I think we actually\Nread more stuff these days
than ever before.
Yeah, I kinda get what\Nyou're saying and kinda not.
Hey, guys. Are ya\Nready to go home?
Yeah. Almost.
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't\Ngo home with you guys today.
Huh? What's the deal?
Do you have to run an\Nerrand or something?
Mhm. I started a\Npart-time job, that's why.
Huh?
Wait, she\Nstarted a part-time job?!
Is the Comp-Fest that\Nimportant to her?!
You know, I'm really surprised
Konata actually went\Nthrough with it.
Me too. She really got\Nherself a part-time job.
I thought that she was just\Nkidding about getting one.
I wonder about it, though...
I'm more surprised by the fact
that someone actually\Nwent and hired her.
That doesn't sound very nice!
Well, for one thing, I'm having\Na hard time picturing her
being a diligent worker.
Good point, Sis.
I wonder where she\Nended up working.
Maybe she works at a bookstore.\NYou know how she likes manga.
I wanna buy this.
Yeah, hang on a sec. I'm in the\Nmiddle of somethin' right now.
Uh?
\NGot 'em!
I really hope she\Ndoesn't get fired...
How 'bout a convenience store?
I wanna buy this.
That'll be 498 yen, please.
Ah, you got the right amount...
--Wha...?\N--
Nah... Not there.
Maybe a fast food place?
\NGot a problem with my smile?
\NMaybe not.
Family restaurants\Nare also outta the question.
\NWelcome...
I wonder what\Nkind of job she got.
\NYeah...
\NMaybe she's a traffic monitor?
\NNah.
\NA video rental place?
\NI dunno...
\NAn izakaya?
\NThat's not it.
\NPizza delivery?
\NNo license!
\NSupermarket cashier.
\NNope.
\NCram school teacher.
\NYou're kidding!
\NA bread factory!
\NHuh?
\NLet's see... Hmm...
\NLet's ask her tomorrow.
Hey, Konata, what kind\Nof place are you working at?
\NYeah, tell us.
\NHm?
Oh... it's just your\Naverage cosplay café.
\NAh. That's perfect for her.
\NShould she be working there?
\NLucky Star!
\NLucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
Second episode! It's me,\NAkira Kogami, your host.
I hope you're all excited,\N'cause I sure am!
And sitting right next to me is\Na wonderful young man who's
going to assist me on the show,
Mister Minoru Shiraishi!\NTa-da-da-da-da-dan!
Uh... f-f-fuh...
I'm Minoru Shiraishi,\NAkira-sama's assistant.
I'm still really new at this,\Nso all I'm hopin' for is that
you guys remember my name, yeah.
Clappity-clap, clap...
Now, I know it's just the second\Nepisode of Lucky Channel,
but we're already got tons\Nof messages from you guys!
Yup! Tons and tons of messages!
You guys are making me\Nsuper happy! Thank you!
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
All this attention's because\Nyou're so popular, Akira-sama.
\NUgh.
Uh... What?
Saw the show today.
Yeah?
--You were in it.\N--Huh?
The show, man! You had a part.
Oh, yeah. They did\Ngive me a little part.
Yeah... They did, didn't they?
Uh-huh. So, uh, what was the\Nscene you were in anyway?
Sure! Um... It was\NScene 45, Part A,
the classroom after vacation.
Right, right.\NYeah, now I remember.
You came and went by so\Nfast, I'd almost forgotten.
Yeah, well, I only had\None line the scene, so I--
Bleh. You complaining or--
No! Nobody's complaining!
You should be thrilled those\Nguys gave a newbie like you
a line in a scene.
Things were different when\NI debuted on the screen...
Oh really? How old were you\Nwhen you made your debut?
Three years old.
Back then, I was ecstatic that\Nthey even gave me a crummy line.
But it's not about how many\Nlines you get, after all.
Well, it was pretty\Ntense for a while there,
being surrounded by the\Nbiggest names in the industry.
What an amazing experience!
Yeah, you were tense.\NI could tell.
Huh?!
You were stiff as a board.\NYou looked like a total amateur.
Tell you what... I don't usually\Ndo this, but what the hell.
Come on, let's hit that scene\Ntogether, you and me.
Uh, you mean like right now?
They might bring you back\Nfor another episode, right?
Yeah... I guess.
You have to practice\Nyour craft, man.
Listen, I'm offering\Nto help you out here!
Oh, yeah! I got it, I got it!
Thank you, I really\Nappreciate it.
The script, please.
So, which scene was it?
\NScene 45.
Oh, yeah... This one.
Okay, I'll play Kuroi,\Nthe teacher.
Whenever you're ready.
Ready, and... Action!
"So, were you guys able to have\Nany fun during the short break?
I know you had a\Nq-q... quiet..."
That's "quite."
"Quite a lot\Nof homework to do.
You also got that little\Nmidterm thingy today.
Don't tell me you spent the\Nwhole vacation goofing off,
instead of studying."
Man, that didn't feel\Nlike a vacation at all.
What was that?
What?
That totally sucked.\NThere's no motivation.
The line didn't deliver.
Deliver?
Deliver here! Right here!\NI gotta feel it!
Oh... I'm sorry.
Hell, if you're just\Ngonna say the line,
a monkey could do that.
But monkeys can't talk, man. I--
--Huh?!\N--Ahh!
I guess it's time\Nto say goodbye now!
I think it's sad when\Nhappy times like this
go by so fast, don't you?
Well, anyway, keep on sending\Nyour questions and comments, and
please don't forget me! I need\Nto know you love me, too, 'kay?
And we'll see all of you\Nin the next episode.
See you later!\NBye, bye, everybody!
\NYeah, so, what are they like?
\NBy "they," you mean...
The cast. Somebody's\Ngetting kicked off, yeah?
They hate each other, right?\NA buncha divas, right?
No, it's not like that.\NEverybody's pretty cool.
Then, why don't\Nyou help a girl out and--
\NAmazing, Kona-chan!
\NWhat a passionate performance!
\NHey, Konata!
Are the next two songs\Ngonna be like the last one?
\NI picked a couple anime songs
with a few from some\Nlive-action shows.
\NThat's not the point!
Pick songs that the rest\Nof us can recognize!
Hey, I can sing\Nwhatever I want, so chill out!
\NFine... Whatever.
Hey, Tsukasa, punch some\Nsongs into that thing,
or we'll be listening to her\Nwarbling anime vocals all night.
\NI don't mind if she does.
\NActually, this is kinda fun.
\NMiyuki, not you, too!
\NSorry if I block the screen,
but I'm gonna do\Nthis one standing.
You really\Nthink that's gonna help?
\NIt's harder if I'm sitting down,
'cause I can't use my diaphragm.
You're gonna sing even\Nlouder than the last song?!
\NHey, footage from the show!
\NWow, look at that!
\NThis looks like a TV show
from way before we were born.
Okay, ladies,\Nhere are your drinks.
\NOh, thank you.
\NUh... oolong tea?
\NThat's me. Thanks.
\NAnd the iced lemon tea?
\NRight here, please.
\NWho had orange juice?
\NThat's me.
\NAnd the ginger ale goes to...?
Oh, yeah...\NJust, uh, right there. Thanks.
On the next\Nepisode of Lucky Star.
\NKagami here.
Okay, so when I put 200 yen
in a vending machine\Nto buy a can of juice
and get back a 50 and some\N10-yen coins as change,
I think to myself, "Score!"
But then, when I wanna buy a\N150-yen ticket for the train,
and after I put in\Na 100-yen coin,
I think, "Oh, I've got\Nfive 10-yen coins left!"
So I put in four,
but I only ever had four,
so now I'm one short.
So I end up putting in another\N100-yen coin to buy the ticket.
And then I get back nine\N10-yen coins as change...
and I feel so defeated,\Nyou know?
Next time: Various People.
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay, let's do this.
\NSure, let's go.
\NGrr!
\NQuit screwin' and start!
\NOh, that's right.
It's time to wear\Nthe summer uniform.
I bet Konata's gonna show\Nup in her winter uniform.
There's always\Nsomeone in every class
who forgets the switch.
\NGood morning, Sis!
And that someone is my sister.
Oh, darn it!
I forgot to send my\Nentry into The Tele
for that giveaway of theirs.
I was kinda hopin' to win that\Napron from Love Apron too,
darn it.
It sounds like you\Ndon't have enough love.
Huh?
You forgot about it because\Nyou don't have enough love
for the show.
Whatever, I've been really busy\Nwith all my committee stuff.
Besides, I also had\Nto study for exams.
No, no, no, no, no.
Those are excuses.
I've never forgotten\Nto send mine in.
Stop comparing yourself to me!
You got time 'cause\Nyou goof off all day!
Besides, the way you\Nsaid that ticks me off!
Ah ha!
How does anyone win\Na contest like that, anyway?
One word, and that's love.
Whatever,\NI'm a woman with no love!
There it is!
Well, if you send in\Na normal-looking postcard,
you're never gonna win anything.
\NWhat do you mean, Kona-chan?
\NI design it so it'd get picked!
Design how?
The first basic step\Nis neat penmanship.
Then you have to make a postcard
that attracts the attention of\Nthe person who's picking 'em.
For example?
For example, take a highlighter\Nand draw a border
around the edges\Nof the postcard.
Ahh, that makes it stand out!
Then draw a picture on it\Nthat's got something to do
with the prize\Nyou're trying to win.
A picture, huh?
Hmm.
But I can't draw too good.
Not to worry, Tsukasa.
Send in a bunch of postcards\Nand overwhelm 'em with volume!
\NI know I can do that.
Although, if you\Ndo it that way,
you can't use a computer\Nand you can't just make one
and make a bunch of copies.
You have to write\Neach entry by hand.
And it's gotta be\Nat least 100.
100?
Sure, it's normal to\Nsend 100 postcards.
That's gonna cost a fortune!
But winning takes\Nlots of time and money.
Winning is all about\Nhow bad you want it.
Okay, but at this point,
wouldn't it just be\Ncheaper to buy it?
You can't buy the feeling\Nyou get when you win something.
Can 100 postcards\Nfit in a mailbox?
No, don't put all of\Nthem in the same mailbox.
You put a few in this one.\NYou put a few in that one.
Just do that\Nevery day for a week.
Really?
Yeah, 'cause if you send in\Na stack of cards all at once,
whoever is choosing will\Nnotice and shove yours aside.
It's a sign of desperation,
so it's not a good\Nidea to do that.
But sometimes it\Nreally pays off.
Then what do you\Nthink I should do?
Like I said, you need love!
Yeah, yeah.
Anyway, if you\Nreally wanna win stuff,
there's always\Nthose free handouts
or those flyers in newspapers.
Just keep your eyes open for\Nthe drawings that don't have
too big a following\Nand you're set.
Then your chances of\Nwinning are pretty high.
\NI'm gonna try that.
\NWhere's the love in that?
\NHmm.
Hmm.
I just noticed something.
You guys look different,\Nfor twins, that is.
Of course. We're fraternal\Ntwins, not identical twins.
You can tell us apart just\Nlike ordinary sisters.
Identical twins look\Nthe same but fraternal twins
come from two different eggs,
so they differ in\Nappearance and personality.
Oh, I get it.
That explains why\NTsukasa's really laid-back,
and you're so vicious.
What'd you say?
You see?
Maybe if you do your\Nhair the same way,
you'll look more alike\Nthan you'd think.
\NKona-chan!
\NNo way, Kagami can't do cute.
Oh, shut up!
And keep your kooky fantasies\Nand comments to yourself!
Hey, are you guys telepathic?
Huh?
\NI heard that even if twins
are raised separately,
they end up having\Nsimilar lives.
If they get married,\Nthey'll pick the same type
of people to marry.
I even heard sometimes\Ntwins marry other twins.
Weird, huh?
It's even weirder when\None twin's in danger,
and the other one gets a feeling
something's wrong, even though\Nthe other twin's far away.
That's a whole lot of\Nphenomena, isn't it?
So you guys have\Nto be telepathic.
Come on, let's try it out.
Hokey-pokey--
Okay, you read\Nway too much manga.
There is ManaKana.
ManaKana?
Yeah, them.
They said there were things\Nabout them that were different.
Like how Mana's the one\Nwho's really cautious,
and Kana's the one\Nwho's optimistic.
And they said that when\Nthey sing they can tell
their voices are different.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
ManaKana always thought\Nthey're from different eggs,
you know, fraternal.
But a little while ago,
they found out they're\Ntwins from the same egg.
What? They're identical?
Yeah, why are you so\Nsurprised about that?
I heard the\Ndefinition of identical
and fraternal twins had\Nbeen changed recently.
You think it's possible\Nthat you and Tsukasa came from
the same egg?
Let's see, how're you\Nguys are the same?
I got it, both of you\Nlike sweets, right?
Yeah, I do.
Sure.
Both of you are\Nalso left-handed.
Yeah.
That's right.
What's your favorite color?
I like white.
Mine's black.
That would be\Nthe color of your souls.
What was that?
I guess all this talk\Nabout eggs and sausages
and stuff got me hungry.
\NWe weren't talking about food.
Ugh, it's so muggy in here.
It's not even that crowded\Nin here and we're sweating!
Guess it's that\Ntime of year again.
Hot!
I wish someone would\Nturn on the air conditioning.
Ah!
Don't do that!
\NSo hot!
Ladybug Samba,\Npunk rock version.
So I just found out\Nthat a cousin of mine's
gonna be getting\Nmarried this month.
Wow, she's gonna\Nbe a June Bride!
That's nice!
\NTell me something.
How did such a wet and\Ngloomy month ever become
synonymous with\Nweddings and happiness?
Uh.
You're wondering why\Nthe month of June is
synonymous with\Nweddings and happiness?
\NUh-huh.
In Roman mythology,\Nthe goddess Juno,
where the word June comes from,
was regarded as the protector\Nof women and marriage.
The Greek's version of Juno,\NHera, was the goddess
of anything related to\Nmarriage and childbirth.
That's why it's said\Nthat whoever gets married
in June will be blessed by
the goddess and have a marriage
filled with happiness.
Oh.
Yeah, but isn't Hera\Nsupposed to be Zeus' wife?
Yes, that's right, she is.
\NI always pictured Hera
to be the jealous type,
'cause Zeus was always\Nfoolin' around on her,
so I'm not feeling\Nthe happy here.
When you get married,
do you wanna wear\Na dress or a kimono?
I'd really like\Nto wear a dress.
It's what I've dreamed of\Nsince I was a little girl.
Hmm, maybe I'd\Nlike to wear a dress.
But I also think\Na kimono would be nice.
Hmm, I wish I could wear both.
They have miniskirts now\Nand all kinds
of colorful wedding dresses too.
Wow, miniskirt\Nwedding dresses.
That could be really cute if\Nit had some kind of frilly
design on the hem.
So many dreams\Nand so many frills.
Oh my.
Tsukasa's like Angel Salvia.
No, actually your hair makes\Nyou look more like Daisy.
So you should be\Nwearing a miniskirt
and your top should be yellow.
\NHuh?
I think Tsukasa-san would\Nlook good in a miniskirt.
You do?
Sure, the outfit's important,
but the kind of person you\Nend up marrying is too.
It could be a childhood friend,
or some girl from a rich family.
That's a tough\Ndecision to make 'cause
one's got the money\Nand the ability
to cast magic spells\Nlike and ,
which always come in handy.
But if you're after true love--
Then, Bianca is the one!
Whoa, Kagami, when\Ndid you get so pure?
I thought you'd go for\Nthe girl with the money.
I'm out of comebacks.
Hiya, Konata!
\NHm?
You know that game I borrowed?
I need help getting\Npast this one level.
Whoa, not so fast\Nthere, Kagamin.
Don't you think it's more\Nfun when you figure things
out like that on your own?
Hmm, yeah, you have a point.
You know it.
It's fun to figure things\Nout on your own, uh-huh.
So I guess you won't be\Ncopying my homework anymore,
will you?\N
Hm.
You know those detectives\Nin manga and TV shows?
Isn't it weird how they\Nkeep coming across murders
all the time?
Guys like Conan & Kindaichi.
If they didn't,\Nthey wouldn't have
any mysteries to solve,\Nwould they?
Really?
'Cause they could go\Nafter normal cases too.
Normal, how?
They could have a case\Nwhere they run all over Japan
looking for a missing person.
Tracking someone down's\Ngot a lot of
game-like aspects to it.
It's got thrills.\NIt's got suspense.
Yeah, I guess.
A case where a husband\Nwants his wife tailed
'cause he thinks she's cheating.
Looking for a lost pet\Ncould be a case.
Yeah, right?
Yeah, but do you think it'd\Nbe any fun to watch that?
Well no, I guess it\Nwouldn't be any fun at all.
You see?
You're right.
Real-life cases don't\Nhave the clever tricks,
bizarre situations
or show-stopping finales\Nthat the crimes in manga
and anime have.
Hmm.
You're right, they don't.
Like faking fingerprints,\Nor scrubbing a crime scene
so luminol won't\Npick up anything.
Huh?
Making it so the forensics\Nteam can't solve it.
Well, the police don't\Nwant someone copying
the perfect crime,
so they censor that\Nstuff from manga and TV.
Yeah, or maybe
perfect crimes happen all the\Ntime but they don't tell us.
Maybe they're never solved.
Ever!
Careful talking like that!
Someone might hear you.
\NDon'tcha hate how
there's been so\Nmuch rain lately?
Yeah, I know.
I remember when I was\Nlittle I used to like
rainy days a lot.
I never liked them 'cause\Nif you go out, you get wet,
and then you can't hang\Nyour clothes out to dry.
How come you liked\Nrainy days so much?
\NBecause if it rained,
there wouldn't be\Nany baseball on TV,
and I'd get to\Nwatch all my anime.
\NI should have known
you'd say something like that.
\NYeah, but now they've got
stadiums with domes.
\NLucky Star.
What's the matter?
You know how in\Nmanga and anime,
they've got really\Nsmart characters
and really stupid characters
and they're both going\Nto the same school?
I've had enough outta you!
Shut up!
If you don't like it, why\Ndon't you get lost, you dork!
I always thought that was\Nkinda strange, don't you?
I noticed something too.
The other day I watched\Nthis anime where the teacher
and the students all\Nlooked the same age,
and it was totally weird.
Heck, the teacher\Nlooked younger!
Uh, ma'am...
Yes, Tachina-san?
That's not surprising\N'cause the world's always
had a fascination\Nwith stuff like that.
People who look\Nyoung and act old,
or people who look\Nold and act young. You know?
\NUh, no.
You never question it.
You just go with the flow.
It's a lot weirder\Nto have students
with different test scores
in the same class,\Ndon't you think?
\NYou're right.
I couldn't agree with you more.
And since you brought it up,\NKonata, I was always surprised
that you got accepted\Nto this school.
You're so good at\Npulling all-nighters,
maybe that's how you\Npassed the entrance exam.
Wait!
Is that how she did it?
Nah, just kidding.
That's way too much\Nwork for an all-nighter.
Oh, thanks goodness.
I'm surprised you\Nactually studied for it.
Did a new quiz game come\Nout for the DS or something?
No, but my dad did give\Nme a couple of conditions.
For a D rank school,\NI'd get a Pippin,
a C rank, a 3DO,\Nand a B rank's a PS2.
\NMan, Izumi's dad sure knows
what buttons to push.
I just thought of something.
Huh?
Huh.
\NI'm surprised Tsukasa's
in the same school as us.
I can't believe you'd\Nbe so blunt about it!
\NK.O.
All right!
Uh, damn!
I can't beat her\Nin a fighting game.
She spends too much\Ntime playing these.
Pick another game.
Even if it isn't a fighter,\NI'll take you on!
Oho, sure about that?
Then how about we\Nplay a quiz game next!
Ugh, you're kidding!
It's a lousy quiz game\Nand she totally beat me!
No way.
\NMaybe she went and memorized
all the questions and answers.
Her memory's sharp as a tack\Nwhen it comes to games!
So what are we\Ngonna play next?
You in a hurry or something?
Hey, that's weird,\Nwhere is it?
Didn't you used to\Nhave an easy party game
that you liked to play?
Hey, how do you know\Nso much about what games
I've got in my house, huh?
Well, I just thought\Nit was something
even you could beat me at.
Really stinky!
Hey, Kagami,
how come you're not eating\Nany of these snacks?
Usually, you gobble 'em all up.
No reason, I just\Ndon't want any.
Oh, I get it.
You're on a summer\Ndiet, aren't ya?
No, I'm not.
It's nothing like that.
No one to show your\Nbathing suit to anyway.
Shut up!
You don't need to go there!
Oh, that's right.
You guys were born\Non the Star Festival.
It's almost your\Nbirthday, isn't it?
Yeah, so what?
Oh, Kona-chan, you\Nremembered our birthday!
Mm-hmm.
We're gonna be seventeen.
Seventeen's the year\Nbefore the unlucky one.
What do you mean?\NWhat's gonna happen?
Seventeen's when unlucky\Nthings start happening
and it's right before\Nthe real unlucky year.
Uh-huh.
So now, with my seventeenth\Nbirthday coming up,
I'm getting a little worried.
I ended up buying power\Nstones and talismans
to ward off evil\Nand other stuff.
Well, at least you're\Nhaving fun, right?
Yeah, right.
I bought so much,\NI got to the point--
Yeah, now that we have one\Nof those reckless charms,
I mean, one of those\Ncautious charms.
\NShe said reckless charm.
She's all, "That's enough.
"Safe childbirth!\NSafe driving!
"Be careful now!"
Heh heh heh.\NYeah, yeah.
Oh, that's right.
Did you guys know that\Nyour birthday happens
to be on Ponytail Day?
Uh-uh, I didn't know.
Why is July seventh\NPonytail Day?
'Cause in the legend\Nof the Star Festival,
Vega had a ponytail.
That's why.
Boy, that's stretching it.
And did you know that\Nthere's this thing called
the Japan Ponytail Association?
And that every year they pick\Na celebrity who they think
would look good in a ponytail
and give 'em an award for it?
Wow, I didn't know.
That's silly.
I mean, doesn't everybody\Nlook good in a ponytail?
Oh, you think so, huh?\N
Oh, I didn't think it\Nwould work with my hair.
How is it?
\NGreat!
A small ponytail is\Nreally cute on you.
Kona-chan, you look great!
I think you totally\Npull off that look.
Yeah, you think so?
Mm, I really do.
Wow, you look so--
Yeah, you look so--
Okay! Fine.
It doesn't work on me.
I get it.
You look manly like a samurai!
Drop it already!
You know how drunks go\Naround with their neckties
wrapped around their heads?
You guys have any\Nidea why they do that?
Yeah, I do.
See, when a drunk\Nloosens his tie,
he's gotta pull it over\Nhis head to take it off.
The tie gets stuck,\Nand there you have it.
\NOh.
What's even weirder are the\Ndrunks that stagger around
carrying take-out boxes.
What's up with that?
Take-out boxes?
You know, Kato-chan\Ncarries 'em in The Drifters.
I still don't get it.
That's the visual\Nof the typical drunk.
They've always got the\Nnecktie around their heads
and they're carrying take-out.
I don't know why that is.
\NYou see?
Vega and Altair.
I hope they meet this year.
\NTwinkle, twinkle, twinkle.
\NI'm just hopin' that
your reckless charm works.
\NYeah, whatever.
The Comp-Fest is in
the middle of a huge\NQuo card giveaway.
You know, you've been collecting\Nthose Quo cards forever,
but I don't think I've\Never seen you use them.
Hm? Oh, I don't use 'em.
But, why do you\Ncollect them, then?
When something comes out\Nthat's related to
a show or manga you like,
don't you wanna have it,\Nas a collector and as a fan?
Okay, but you're supposed to\Nuse those things, aren't you?
You can't use them, ever!
You have to store\Nthem someplace safe.
It really pisses me off\Nwhen I see all those people
using those cards\Nlike common money.
These are sacred things.
They're meant to be bought\Nand carefully archived.
You're not supposed to use 'em,
and it's out of the question\Nto go and auction 'em!
If you do, you'll fail both\Nas a fan and as a collector!
Okay.
Didn't think you get\Nso worked up about it.
Here's how I do it.
I always get three cards\Nfor the collection.
First off, I pull\Nthe most pristine one
and lock it away for\Neternity in a special case.
The second card's for me to keep
so I can look at it\Nevery now and then.
And the third one?
It's a loaner.
You're kidding.
Kagami, isn't it human\Nnature to want two or three of
something that you\Nreally, really like?
Come on, aren't\Nyou the same way?
Huh?
Uhh.
Fine, whatever. So you don't.
I'm an otaku.
I'm totally weird.
I'm a weirdo.
No, I, I didn't say that.
I think I sort of know what\Nyou're saying, I guess.
Tsukasa,\Nyou seem like the type
who'd be popular with boys,
but I never hear\N'em talk about you.
She's kinda on the plain side,
so she doesn't really stand out.
Mm.
I think it's 'cause she's got\Na scary sister guarding her!
You say something?
Maybe it's not\Nbecause I'm plain.
Maybe it's because you guys\Nand Yuki-chan are more unique.
Yeah, that Miyuki-san, she\Nsure is smart and pretty.
She's got an awesome figure!
She wears glasses,\Nshe hates the dentist,
and she's clumsy in a cute way--
\NHey, you're getting
weird on us again.
You know I've never heard any\Nrumors about Miyuki either.
Maybe guys are\Nscared to talk to her
'cause she's so pretty.
Oh, I doubt that.
She's totally nice and\Ngets along with everyone.
I guess you're right.
Hey, maybe she gets\Nasked out all the time.
And then she turns\Nall of them down?
I don't know, maybe she does.
Maybe she doesn't even\Nknow she's being asked out
when they ask her.
Oh, that might be it.
You know, Yuki-chan's\Nsort of clueless,
so maybe guys need\Nto be more direct
when they ask her out.
I swear!
Your class has gotta be\Nfilled with a bunch of
scared little boys.
You're telling me that there's\Nnot one of them with the guts
or passion to go up to Miyuki\Nand ask her out on a date?
I don't think so.
Maybe what the school needs\Nare more maniacs in class.
\NHuh?
Oh, yeah, girls\Nlike Miyuki-san
are much more appealing\Nto the maniacs.
Maniacs, huh?
\NOh no!
I didn't realize it\Nwas already this late.
Sorry, but I think\NI have to go now.
\NOh, already?
\NYes, I'm sorry,
but don't mind me.\NI'll see you later, okay?
Well, I'm off then.
\NHave a good rest of the day!
\NLater!
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.
So here's the end of the story.
This guy got up and then he--
\NHuh?
Oh no.
Excuse me!
\NYeah!
I'm so sorry.
Eh, don't worry about it.
Yeah, that always happens!
It's no big deal.
Even I've done it before.
I've done it too.
See, it happens to\Neverybody at least once.
You've done it too, right?
Never.\NUh.
And that, Kagami, was\Nan example of moe-ism.
Miyuki-san, good job, girl!
Lucky Star.\N
\NLucky channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
Yeah!
It's time for more super\Nfun on Lucky Channel!
And I'm your navigator,\NAkira Kogami, and--
Oh, and I'm Minoru Shiraishi,\NAkira-sama's assistant.
How's it going?
Yeah, sure.
You know,\Ntoday's a really special day
because it's officially...
Ta-da!
Our third episode together!
What do you think,\NShiraishi-san?
Are you getting the hang of it?
Yeah, no, not really.
I'm sorry.
Aww.
Looks like Shiraishi-san's\Nhaving a hard time opening
up to me, and that\Nmakes me really sad!
You're even sitting further\Naway from me than usual.
Huh?
Guess this means you\Ndon't like me anymore.
Sob!
Whoa! Hey, that's not true!
Look!
Scoot.
Hi! I wanna start this episode\Nwith a twinkle today!
You see, we're gonna\Nstart doing something
that'll make all you\Nfans out there happy!
That's right!
Today's our first\Ninstallment of Lucky Star
featured character\Nintroductions!
Bom bom bom bom!
Yes, today, we'd like\Nto introduce you to
Miss Miyuki Takara.
Let's see.
She's a class committee-chair.\NShe's beautiful.
She's gentle and kind.\NShe's kanullabul?
\NKnowledgeable.
Knowledgeable, good at\Nsports and super human, too.
Shiraishi-san, you know a lot\Nabout Miyuki-san, don't you?
That's right,\NI know all about her.
She's a really nice person.
Besides that,\Nshe wears glasses,
which makes her even more\Npretty, as you can see.
You know, when someone's\Nas beautiful as she is,
you feel like you can't\Nreally approach her.
However, she's actually\Nvery easy-going
and will talk to any--
\NWow, it would be nice
if you were that talkative\Non my radio show.
Uh.
Ugh, you just can't stop talking\Nabout that girl, can you?
Well, uhh, I know her, and\NI was just telling everyone--
Sure you were.
Miyuki-san was it?
Miyuki with the pretty face,
Miyuki with the big boobs.
Every fault's an aspect of moe.
Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Come to think of it, don't\Nthe maniacs go for her type?
Sure, she's got the maniacs,
but I've still got my\Npedophiles so take that.
Oh no!
It's time to say\Ngoodbye, isn't it?
I hope you had\Na super happy fun time!
We wanna know what you\Nthink about the show,
and I wanna know what\Nyou think about me.
So, send those cards\Nand letters, please?
Yeah, well, we hope to\Nsee you again next time!
See ya later!
Okay, so what's she really like?
\NWell, like I described her.
\NOh, please.
You mean she's not\Nbackstage burning through
a pack of smokes\Nevery 15 minutes?
\NOh, no,
she's not like you, she's--
\NUh-huh.
\NThat was so cool.
\NIt certainly was a unique song.
\NI'd like to hear a song
that normal people know.
\NOh, you'll know
the next one, Kagami.\NPromise.
\NHuh?
\NIntro's comin' up!
Try to guess it.
\NIt's not gonna be
another weird song, is it?
\NHmm, what is this?
\NI don't know.
\NKagamin, your answer please.
\NOh, FMP, Full Metal Panic!
\NOh.
\NAnd it's your
favorite version, Kagamin.\NFumoffu!
\NOh, really?
\NNo, I just read the book
and got a little.
\NKona-chan, you're good!
\NShe has such
a mature singing voice!
\NShe's just
impersonating the singer.
So, how about you guys?
What are you gonna sing?
\NI'm not sure if
there's anything I can sing.
\NI don't think
I know any of these songs.
\NLike it matters!
Come on, Konata's gonna\Nbe singing this stuff
all night if we\Ndon't pick anything.
Pick something!
\NOkay, I'll try.
I'm not confident about\Nmy singing though.
\NIt's all right.
We're the only ones listening,
so just pick a song\Nand have some fun!
\NReally?
Okay.
\NOn the next episode
of Lucky Star...
Tsukasa here!
So, um, the other day\NI laughed so hard
I couldn't breathe.
I thought I was gonna pass out.
And the next morning at school
I'm out of time?!
Next time,\NA Question of Motivation!
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay, let's do this!
\NSure, let's go!
\NGrr!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
Anyone wanna\Ntackle this problem?
Shiraishi?
Aww, you made me\Ndo the last one.
Really?
Then, Izumi.
Izumi!
No, I wasn't sleeping.
I didn't say you were,\Nyou have a good nap?
Oh no, I forgot\Nmy English textbook!
Then just go borrow Kagami's.
She already had English\Ntoday, didn't she?
Jeez, what's with you?
How could you be so careless?
Yeah, I know.
Check your bag before\Ncoming to school.
Tsukasa forgets stuff\Nall the time, doesn't she?
All the time.
But now that you mention it,
you never forget stuff\Nlike textbooks, do you?
I have to say, when it\Ncomes to things like that,
I'm pretty reliable.
I never take my textbooks\Nhome, so there's no worries.
Yeah, see what I'm saying?
That's not being\Nreliable at all.
If you leave your books here,
then you can't study the stuff
you learned in class that day.
But I never study at\Nhome, so what's the point?
Yeah, you take your\Nbooks home to study
the night before a\Ntest, blah, blah, blah.
But Kona-chan's really good
at pulling the all nighters.
That's it, I bet\Nthat's the reason
I always forget\Nto do my homework!
Hello, it's not\Nthat you forget
to do your homework, you\Nlack the motivation to do it.
Speaking of homework,\Ncan I see today's stuff
for Japanese class?
See what I mean?
I just thought of something.
If you're in the\Nsame class as Miyuki,
why don't you ask\Nto see her homework?
Yeah, how do I put it?
Miyuki-san's such a good person,
that it just doesn't\Nfeel right asking her.
It feels kinda weird, you know?
You sorta get what I'm saying?
Yeah kind of, that's\Na pretty weak excuse,
if you ask me.
Izumi. Izumi?
What, is she late again?
No, stop, hold it!
I'm here, I'm not late!
I'm late, but I'm late cuz
I was helping someone out!
Oh.
It's someone I hang\Nout with all the time,
but today I couldn't just get up
and leave 'em like that\N'cause it's not right!
Kay.
So then he said\Nno worries I'm cool,
let's disband, but I can't,
cuz if the other five\Nget what they want,
and that one guy's the only one
who couldn't get it, that sucks,
and I kinda feel guilty, cuz\Nthat's not cool, you know?
I mean when you've been\Nhangin' out with people
this long you're\Nsupposed to back 'em up.
Yeah, havin' friends is\Na good thing, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
So I guess you spent all\Nnight gaming it up online,
is that it?
Kept playing after\NI logged off, huh?
Izumi, Izumi?
What, is she late again?
No, stop, hold it!
I'm here, I'm not late!
I was walking\Npast the strip mall
on my way here and this\Ngirl bumps into me,
and all of a sudden\Nshe grabs my hand,
and starts running.
She tells me that she\Nstole a piece of taiyaki
and is on the run!
I'm running and\Nlistening to her,
and I'm thinking she's nuts!
So we're running,\Nand I'm thinking,
"Why me?"
But she's holding on\Nto me and I'm stuck,
and we duck into\Nthis cafe to hide
from the owner of\Nthe taiyaki shop.
There's so many places\Nin that story to nitpick!
But I can't do it!
As a teacher, as a human being.
Oh, I caught a summer cold.
Hey, Izumi, is\Nsomething wrong with you?
Yeah, I'm\Nreally sorry, ma'am.
But I need to take\Na sick day today.
Haha, you were\Nup all night gaming, huh?
Used the sick excuse before,\Nso it ain't gonna work.
No, I really am\Nsick this time--
\NDon't tell me,
"I got a summer cold."
The rainy season's over now,
and the weather's great.
So get out of bed\Nand get to class!
She didn't even believe me,
she treated me like I'm the boy\Nwho cried wolf or somethin'.
Well, you reap what you sow.
You feeling any\Nbetter today, Kona-chan?
I think my fever's gone down,
but my throat still kinda hurts.
Oh, I know why that is,
it's cause you breathe\Nthrough your mouth.
\NHuh?
Huh what?
Well yeah, everyone\Nbreathes through their mouth,
but you mostly breathe\Nthrough your nose, don't you?
Yeah, but Kona-chan probably
breathes through her mouth\Nway more than her nose.
Hmm?
I mean, you know how\Nwhen you got a throat cold,
it's cuz the cold virus\Ngot in through your mouth?
And if you get a sinus cold,
it's cuz it got in\Nthrough your nose.
So you figure anyone\Nwho gets a throat cold
is a mouth-breather cuz\Nthat's how the virus
got in their throat, get it?
How about we let Miyuki-san\Nhandle stuff like this?
-Yeah.\N-Okay.
It's hot.
And I don't feel\Nlike doin' anything.
Hello, Kagami.
How about we have\Nyour birthday party
over at my place today?
It's so hot right now\NI can't move a muscle.
\NAww, that sucks,
I was just baking\Nsome cookies too.
Coming.
Cool, see you in a bit.
Come on in.
Happy birthday, Tsukasa,
and the other one\Nwith the longer hair.
I have a name!
Happy birthday,\NKagami-san and Tsukasa-san,
I hope you like the\Nflowers we brought.
Ohh, thank you.
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
I know it's not much,
but I saw these and\Nthought you'd like them.
What is it?
Oh please, open it!
Oh, they're matching earrings!
I couldn't decide\Non what to get,
but I thought those\Nmight look great on you!
You two are gonna flip,
when you see the\Npresents I got you.
What is it?
Go on, open it.
What's this?
A brigade leader armband.
I knew you'd love it.
Jeez, Konata,
why do you think I'd\Nwear something like this?
Aww, come on,\NKagami, just put it on!
I think it'd look\Nperfect on you.
It's more your style.
\NUm, what's this?
To Heart?!
It was really expensive, too.
Take care of it\Nwhen you wear it.
Hey, stop trying make\Nboth of us cosplay!
Oh, it's not that different\Nfrom our school uniforms.
That could be a problem.
Well, if it's too big.
I know, and\Nwhat if it's stinky too?
You know, it's our birthday.
You think you could ease\Nup on the cookie-eating?
I can't help it, Tsukasa\Nmakes the best cookies ever.
Oh, glad you like 'em.
Actually, I helped her\Nbake those this morning.
Yeah, she taught me a lot.
So what's wrong with you?
I dunno, but\Nsuddenly I'm thinkin'
that a few of these cookies
aren't as tasty as some\Nof the other cookies are.
What was that?!
Is this one of\Nyour cookies, Kagami?
Is anyone ready for\Na slice of this yummy cake?
That's our Kagami,\Na hard worker.
But only on her birthday.
Shut up.
By the way, when\Nyou guys cut the cake,
do you end up arguing about it?
Huh? 'Bout what?
The cake, I mean you're\Ncutting all those slices.
How do you decide who gets\Nthe strawberry on top?
And which one of you gets to eat
the little chocolate thingy?
You've always loved\Neating the chocolate sign,
right, sis?
My slicing's off today.
It's not moe\Nwhen she's clumsy.
Wha'd you say?!
Thank you for the food.
Thank you for the food.
What's wrong?
My\Nstrawberry's so small.
What's the matter?
Do I have cake on my\Nface or something?
I think I just found another
charming quality\Nabout Kagami is all.
Stop talking like him, okay?
Can you believe summer\Nvacation's almost here again?
You're right, it is.
The beach, the pool,\Nsummer festivals.
Anything else that we\Nabsolutely have to do?
Screech.
There's only one festival\Nthat matters during summer:
The War Zone in Ariake!
No matter what, it's\Ngotta be Comiket!
No, no, no, no no, no no.
That stuff's only for you!
War Zone?
Well, I guess there's\Nsomething for everyone to do.
Some people like to visit\Ntheir relatives, right?
Good morning, everyone.
Hi, Miyuki.
Hey, what do you do\Nevery summer vacation?
Well, let me see.
There was talk about\Nvacationing overseas again,
we'll probably do that.
Again? Did you say again?
Damn bourgeois!
Isn't that yogurt?
When you said you started\Nworking at the Cosplay Cafe,
I was kinda surprised.
Don't those places only hire\Ngirls with amazing figures?
Yeah.
I know, my lack of breastiness
is something that's\Nalways really bugged me.
But in this game, they were\Nsaying that a flat chest
was a status symbol, and\Nhow it's considered rare.
And when you think about it,
there's probably a demand\Nfor that kind of thing.
I'm quite the\Nvaluable commodity.
I wanna know how\Na line from a game
can make you so confident.
Then maybe I'm valuable too?
Finals are coming up,
and here you are playing\Ngames all the time.
You should be\Nstudying, you know?
If only you could somehow\Nchannel your passion
for gaming into studying more,
your grades would\Nbe so much better.
If a game could\Ninfluence her that much,
maybe if there was a game\Nthat promoted studying,
it would turn her into a genius.
There are those moe quiz games.
What's wrong?
Hasn't there been an awful\Nlot of teenage crime lately?
I know, and when it happens,
they always ask the\Nneighbors about it,
and they say something like:
"He always seemed\Nto be a nice boy,
"he didn't seem to be the\Ntype that could do that."
Well, then that's all the\Nmore reason to be careful.
You can't tell what\Nsomeone's capable of,
until they snap.
Although if you ever\Ndid something horrible:
"I always\Nknew deep down,
"she'd do something like this,"
is exactly what\NI'd tell everyone.
It's so hot.
It's so hot, I don't feel\Nlike doing anything anymore.
I know what you mean.
It has been hot lately.
Then again, you've always\Ngot one reason or another
for not doing anything, doncha?
Lucky Star!
Hello there, Kagami.
Hey, so how's the\Nstudying coming along, huh?
Yeah well, I was just\Ncleaning up my room.
\NHuh?
You know how when\Nyou've got somethin'
important you have to do,
but you get this urge\Nto clean up instead?
\NYeah, I get it.
Go study.
All right, time to\Nget some studying done.
I think I'd better\Ntake a 30 minute break.
I'm starting to lose\Nmy concentration.
Aww, time's up already?
30 more minutes,\Njust 30 more minutes.
Oh.
Oh yeah, it's almost\Ntime for Haruhi to start.
Click.
Talk about cutting corners,
Nagato just sat\Nthere the whole time.
Man, that guy's not\Nreally doing it for me anymore.
Whoa, that's right guys.
Let the flaming begin.
It's two A.M.
I'd better stop for today.
I'll just sleep a bit\Nand wake up early.
If I get up at five, I'll\Nget three hours of sleep.
Then I've got the\Nwhole morning to study.
After all of that, I\Nended up watching anime,
and reading my manga\Nall night long.
Oh, that's just like you.
That's one thing\Nabout you Konata,
you've got strange tastes,
when it comes to\Nanime and manga.
You only read the\Nstuff guys like,
and you play those dating sims.
Well yeah, it's probably cuz
my dad likes that kinda stuff.
So, go figure, it's\Nrubbed off on me.
When I was little,\NI'd sit next to him,
and watch him read\Nand play his games.
I get the manga part,
but what kind of father\Nplays adult-oriented
dating sims with his\Ndaughter sitting there?
Ew.
If both you and your dad\Nare into that kinda stuff,
what does your mother\Nthink about it all?
Oh, my mom's been gone\Nfor a long time now.
Yeah, I never told you,
but my mom died when\NI was really young.
I'm so sorry.
I guess it means I can\Ndo the household chores
better than anyone,\Neven you, Kagami.
How can you go off\Non a tangent like that,
after you've brought\Nthe mood down?
I bet you're a really\Ngood cook, Tsukasa.
I dunno if I'm all that good,
but I do love to cook.
I wonder how good\NMiyuki-san is at cooking.
I bet because she's rich,\Nshe's probably awful
at doing the housework.
Oh, do I know how to cook?
Actually, I only help\Nout around the house
every now and then.
So I'm afraid I'm not very\Ngood at chores and things.
I'm ashamed to say it.
\NSee, told ya.
Yeah, but Miyuki's so\Ngood at everything else,
you can't possibly\Ncompare her to any of us.
She's just being\Nmodest when she says
she's not good at\Nsomething, that's all.
Hmm, I guess you're right.
That's not true.
I just thought\Nof someone else.
How about our teacher?
She says she lives alone,
and I always got\Nthe impression that
she'd be a total slob.
What are you talking about?
These days, anybody can get by,
without knowing how to cook.
You've heard of\Nconvenience stores, right?
I'm kidding, I do all my chores!
I cook and clean\Nas good as anyone!
\NPlease don't joke,
when your joke doesn't\Nsound like a joke!
Tsukasa hasn't given\Nmy dictionary back yet.
Tsukasa?
Sorry, but can I have\Nmy dictionary back?
I was just cleaning up,\Ncuz I figured, I would?
You too, huh?
Hey, whacha thinkin' about?
They want everybody\Nwho's workin'
at the Cosplay Cafe to\Ncome up with new stuff
for the summer menu.
Really, they make\Nyou guys do that?
Wait, you haven't stopped\Nstudying for the exams, right?
That's it, since it's hot out,
how about we have\Nsomethin' hot and spicy,
like an ultra-spicy ramen?
How about coming\Nup with something
that you'd actually\Norder in a cafe?
An ultra-spicy parfait!
Do you think you could\Nstop and think for a second,
before you answer a question?
I can't stand up.
Could somebody tell\Nmy why our school
doesn't have a swimming class?
We have a pool, don't we?
I hate to admit it,
but I'm glad we don't\Nhave a swimming class.
Huh, why is that?
Remember how I told\Nyou I couldn't open
my eyes under water?
I can't swim very\Nfar because of that.
It's so embarrassing.
Your weaknesses are\Nyour greatest strength,
it's so unfair!
That's right, this\Nsummer's ComFest
is just right around the corner!
Oh yeah, the only\Nreason I went out
and got myself a\Njob was for ComFest.
A festival, and with\Nit, so many memories.
Why'd you pull out an old\Nreference like that one?
Well, when you're excited,
and everyone around\Nyou's getting excited,
don't you get the feeling\Nyou make each other
that much more excited\Nfor the festival?
If you could only\Nfocus a tiny bit
of that passion on\Nyour schoolwork.
I can't get to sleep.
I guess I'll read a\Nbook, maybe that'll help.
I just bought this, it'll do.
I didn't get any sleep,\Nand it's already morning.
And now I'm tired and\Nready to go to sleep.
Figures.
Stare.
I know I'm supposed to\Nturn off my cell phone
when I'm next to\Nthe priority seats,
cuz it's got somethin' to do\Nwith pacemakers and stuff.
Mm hmm.
But I don't get\Nwhy we're not allowed
to talk on our phones\Nanywhere else on the train.
Well isn't it because\Nwhen you do that,
you're bothering\Neveryone around you
with your conversation?
Hmm, I guess.
But aren't trains\Nfilled with people
that talk too loud, even when\Nthey're not on the phone?
I'm talkin' both men and women.
Well yeah, I\Nguess that's true.
Do you guys do your New\NYear's priestess thing
at the shrine during summer too?
Nah, we don't do that\Nkinda stuff in the summer.
And you know, I\Nstill can't believe
that it's already\Nthat time of year.
I know, what are you eating?
Aren't you supposed\Nto be on a diet?
\NYeah, that.
Well, I guess with all the\Nstudying I've been doing,
I got on the scale yesterday,
and I'd lost a little weight.
So I figure, why not, you know?
Woah, don't tell\Nme you gave up.
\NGood morning.
Good morning, Kona-chan.
Hey, what's the\Nmatter, Kagami?
Konata!
It's my weight again,\NI gained it all back
in like the blink of an eye!
That's cuz you\Nlet your guard down,
and ate too many snacks.
Hey, wasn't that a Senryu?
You're making such\Na big deal out of it,
you don't look any different,
if you gain a kilo or two.
Why bother getting\Nexcited or freaked out
about each kilogram anyway?
This is one of the\Nreasons why girls are so--
Hello, you're supposed\Nto be a girl too, arencha?
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hi Luckies!
Lucky Channel's back,
and I'm so glad to\Nsee you guys again.
So have all of you\Nbeen doing well?
I'm Akira Kogami,
and I'll be giving you 120%.
This week I'll be--
Just kidding, I'm\NMinoru Shiraishi,
the assistant.
Hey.
Don't you ever cut me off again!
I'm so sorry!
This isn't kid's play,
so learn how to handle yourself.
Like a professional.
Or maybe you don't\Nwant this job anymore.
No, no!
I'm really very sorry.
I promise you, I'll do my best!
Okay, today we've got, ta da!
Really super important news
for all the Lucky\NChannel fans out there!
If you picked up the\NNovember issue of
Comptiq, you'll know\Nall about Akira's
fashion project.
You were supposed to\Nsend me a postcard,
and you did!
A whole lot of postcards!
Uh, you know, I think\Nthere was someone else
involved in that project\Nwith you, wasn't there?
Thank you so much for\Nsending in your entries!
I am mammoth happy!
I don't think I\Nknow that reference,
is it from the 80s?
Now I'm gonna single-handedly
pick the one idea out\Nof all the amazing
entries you sent in.
This'll do.
Let's see, this is\Nfrom a Miss Cherry,
who lives in Saita\NCity, Saitama.
Akira Fashion Project!
On Lucky Star, Kagami-san\Nlooks super cute,
in her pigtails,\Nwhy don't you try
putting your hair in\Npigtails too, Akira-san?
Oh, pigtails, huh?
Oh, yeah!
You're right, Cherry!
A girl loves long hair\Nmore than anything!
And if she puts her\Nhair in pigtails,
maybe if I did that it\Nwould look cute too.
I dunno if that's a good idea.
Your hair's kinda short.
Pigtails'll make you--
Yeah well, it's not\Nlike having long hair
is better or anything, right?
Don't sit like that.
Long hair weighs you down.
It takes forever to\Nshampoo, you know that?
That looks passe\Nthese days anyway.
You guys are always\Ngoin' off about how much
you like the long hair,\Nbut if you think about it,
hell, you don't\Nknow a damn thing.
If you could just\Ncome back to topic?
You don't know how much time,
how much money, how much\Neffort goes into maintaining--
-Hello?\N-Nobody notices.
It's time to say\Ngoodbye, isn't it?
Oh well, if you\Nguys are wondering
how I'm gonna look in\Npigtails, don't worry!
Go to my website\Nand take a peek!
And don't forget my radio show!
I hope you guys tune in, kay?
Please keep sending\Nthose letters!
Yeah, please look forward\Nto the next episode.
\NSo what's up with the attitude?
\NWhat attitude?
You kept snapping\Nat me, what's that?
Did I piss you off when I\Ncorrected you or something?
No! I didn't think\Nthey'd recognize
Nouri peace speak from the 80s!
Huh?\NEh?
\NHuh.
\NLook, I'm really sorry.
Let's just forget\Nabout the whole thing.
You know--\NYes?
They're auditioning\Nfor Minoru Shiraishi.
You're kidding?!\NNope.
\NWhen'd this happen?!
You should try out.
What are\Nyou talking about?!
\NBreak a leg.
\NBut I'm the real guy!
\NHuh? The real what?
\NWhuh?
\NKona-chan, you're amazing,
you can sing anything!
As long as\Nit's an anime song.
I think\Nyou sing wonderfully,
and in different voices too.
It's the\Nnumber one rule,
that when you sing\Na song from anime,
you have to do it exactly\Nlike the original singer.
\NReally?
\NAll right, my turn now.
What are\Nyou gonna sing, sis?
Her title came\Nup a little while ago.
But I don't know the song.
Miyuki, you\Ndon't know this song?
\NNo.
Practice what\Nyou preach, right Kagami?
\NEh.
\NOh, I heard this one before.
Well yeah, we've\Nbeen watching the show together.
\NOh, I forgot.
I like the movie\Nbetter than the series.
\NYeah, whatever, old man!
\NHey, she's good.
Yeah, out of all\Nour sisters, she's the best.
\NOn the next episode
of Lucky Star:
Hello, it's Miyuki.
Did you know that Golden Week
is a term the motion picture\Nindustry came up with?
Apparently around this time,
there's an increase\Nin movie-goers.
Next time, The Famous Shooter.
\NLook forward to it.
\NOkay, let's do this!
\NSure, let's go!
\NGrr!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
Well, starting tomorrow,
you guys get to have\Na nice, long break.
Don't forget you're\Nstill students,
and behave like the\Ngood little boys
and girls I know you are.
\NOkay!
I don't know why,
but you students get antsy\Naround this time of year.
Then y'all get bored and go out
and cause some trouble.
And as your\Nlong-suffering teacher,
that makes me very worried.
Please behave, and don't\Ncause any problems.
Got that?
'Cause if you guys get\Nall delinquent out there,
you're gonna ruin my vacation!
Behave yourselves,\NI'm begging you!
\NThis isn't good.
Yay, we're officially\Non vacation now!
And the best thing about it is
the fact that I won't have
to see your face\Neach and every day.
Come on, sis.
You know, I just\Nrealized that even though
I'm on vacation, I'm still gonna
see our teacher every day.
\NWhy?
You taking an extra\Nclass or something?
No, we're both\Nin the same party
in this net game.
Yeah, of course you are.
\NNet game?
Our teacher's a wiz,\Nand I'm a tanker.
When the two of us\Nteam up, I'm the one
who's gotta pull the monsters.
It's a pretty\Nsweet deal in terms
of cash and XP.
It's nice, she's got my back,
but I'm always the\None running around.
All she has to do is click\NAoE skills the whole time.
Check this out!
The other day,\NI pulled a ton of mobs,
but Teach went and fell\Nasleep at the keyboard.
It took me all day to\Nget my XP points back.
Ugh, try speaking a\Nlanguage we understand.
Good morning.
I can't believe how\Nhot it is, can you?
I know, amazing\Nhair by the way.
How 'bout we turn
the air conditioning on?
Jeez, there you go.
Don't be so quick to\Nrely on stuff like that.
Use a fan or something\Nand suck it up.
Here.
Ahh!
You're right, a fan gets\Nit pretty cool, too.
Yeah, see?
But I'm still hot.
You get so tired fanning,
and you know how when\Nyou stop fanning,
you feel even\Nhotter than before?
Yeah, well, yeah.
Good try, though.
This is so much fun,
we're all wearing yukatas!
\NMm-hmm!
Well, I know\Nit's kinda like cheating,
but our obis are\Nthe pre-tied kind.
They're much easier to put on.
Yeah, putting on\Na kimono or yukata's
hard enough, you know?
You have a proper tied-up obi,
don't you, Miyuki?
I'll bet you even\Ntied it yourself!
Oh, no, actually,\NI had the person
at the shop tie it for me.
Tying something\Nlike an obi would
be much too difficult\Nfor me, to say the least.
I heard that.
Hey, aren't you wearing\Na proper one, too?
I didn't expect that.
Mm-hmm.
Did someone at\Nthe store tie it up for you?
Nope, I got my dad\Nto tie it for me.
Oh, really?
C'mon, let's go!
How come her dad\Nknows how to tie an obi?
Hey, Konata-chan!
Huh, who's that?
Are you in trouble with the law?
That's Yui nee-san,\Nshe's my cousin.
Nice to meet ya!
I hope you're behaving\Nyourself today.
Make sure you listen to\Nwhat these older girls say
and get home early, okay?
No, no, no, no, no.
Konata isn't an average girl,
we're all in the same grade!
No, all of us are\Nin the same grade!
Really?
I'm so sorry, I couldn't tell!
I mean, they're so much\Ntaller than, you know.
Yeah.
No worries!
\NI'd tell ya,
kids these days,\Nyou guys sure do
mature awful fast, don't you?
No, like I said, Konata isn't
a normal girl.
We're the normal ones, lady!
Oh, look, it's a\Nshooting gallery.
Hey, Yui nee-san, I bet\Nyou're good at this stuff.
Well, the truth is,
I'm so good, all the\Nguys back at the station
call me Sharpshooter Yui.
In three seconds, I\Ncan shoot five rounds,
and blast a peace\Nsign on the face
of a paper target.
Here, show us how\Nawesome you are.
That's a rifle!
I have to use a rifle?
I didn't know.
I only ever use pistols.
Go, go, shoot, shoot!
Hey!
What's with the\Ngoofy poses, Narumi?
You know you're\Nstill on the clock!
You're on patrol, so patrol!\N
\NOkay then...
Hey, mister, how does this work?
If we hit a target, can we\Npick one of those prizes?
Anything you hit, you get.
It's all good.
Anything?
Yup, anything you hit.
Hmm.
Whoa, lady,\NI'm not the prize!
Lower the gun and back away.
At a summer festival, you\Ncan't forget the shaved ice!
It is hot, let's get some!
\NOkay, here we are.
I'm lookin' at\Nall these flavors.
They've got strawberry,\Nlemon, melon.
Wait, what the\Nheck's a Blue Hawaii?
What kind of flavor is that?
Well, it's Blue\NHawaii-flavored, I guess.
Of course, I figured\Nyou'd say that.
What do you think, Miyuki-san?
Do you have any idea\Nwhat a Blue Hawaii is?
What's a Blue Hawaii?
Uh, lemme see...
Perhaps it's a song,
♪ Blue ♪
No, blue.
I don't really know.
Sorry I didn't know\Nthe answer to that.
I'll look it up when\NI get home, okay?
Mm, yeah, sure.
\NIt is possible that--
Yeah, no, the person\Nwho wants to know
should be looking\Nit up, not Miyuki.
Umm,
I think I might know about\Nthat Blue Hawaii thing.
Hm?
Yeah, I heard\Nsomewhere that the name
and the flavor come from\Nthis blue-colored cocktail.
I also heard that it's\Ncalled the Blue Hawaii
'cause it's named after\Nthe movie Blue Hawaii.
So that's where it comes from!
That was a good reference.
Hee-hee.
Man, when Tsukasa's the\None teaching me something,
I end up feeling\Nlike a total loser!
I just noticed I only have\Na little bit of money left!
Tsukasa, nothing\Nis cheap around here.
Think a little before you\Nspend your money, I swear.
\NCome on, Kagami,
it's a festival.
You spend a ton of money here
'cause you get caught\Nup in the vibe.
Yeah, I guess.
Same thing with Comiket,
you don't think\Nyou're spending a lot
on doujinshi, but that's\Nthe illusion of it!
Then you're like,\N"Whoa, I'm broke!"
\NI'll never understand
the world you live in.
You get up early\Nto stand in line,
and getting from the west\Nhall to the east hall
is like a hike and a half.
Yeah, I\Nstill don't understand!
Cotton candy's so\Nfluffy and sweet,
I really love it.
You're not\Na little kid anymore.
Slow down, or you'll be sick.
I don't know, I never\Nthought doing that
with another girl\Nwas that much fun.
Don't go there.
Would it be too much to ask
for a little romance\Nin our lives?
We're at a summer\Nfestival wearing yukatas!
If this was a dating\Nsim, chances are
one of us would trigger\Na flag somewhere.
\NA flag?
There'd also be\Nan event scene,
'cause we're outside\Nwearing yukatas!
Wow, okay horndog, we got it.
Is there anything\Nyou wanna play, Kagami-san?
Hmm, now that you mention it,
I'd kinda like to do\Nsome goldfish scooping.
I haven't even tried anything\Nand they're running away!
Maybe it's because deep\Ndown in their fishy hearts,
they know you're\Ntotally vicious.
The ugly truth has been\Nrevealed at last, mm-hmm.
Ooh, look!
There's one, you see it?
Oh yeah, I see 'em!
Okay.
All right!
I got one, I got one, yeah!
Yay, sis!
Don't worry, little guy.
I'm gonna take\Ngood care of you.
Hey, I knew I'd see you guys!
I heard there was\Na festival thing
going on around here,
so I thought I'd swing by
and check it out, you know?
I really love festivals!
\NSo, did you come here
with your boyfriend\Nor something?
Of course not,\NI don't have a boyfriend!
\NThere isn't even a tiny bit
of romance for us\Nanywhere, is there?
\NSurprise, surprise.
Well, well, we meet again.
Looks like you're having\Nfun with a new friend.
Howdy!
Huh?
Wow, this girl looks like\Nshe hit puberty super early!
Girl?
Nope, wrong,\Nshe's our teacher.
I'm so sorry, I totally\Njumped to conclusions
and thought you were\Ntheir classmate.
Nah, it's okay.
This is my\Ncousin, Yui nee-san.
She's a cop, but I guess\Nyou figured that out.
Yeah, and because today's\Nthe summer festival,
they've got me on duty, pounding
the pavement out here.
Can you believe they make\Nus work in heat like this?
\NWork?
Looks like you're having fun.
Are you working today, too?
You know, like, making\Nsure your students
don't cause any trouble?
Nah, I was bored, so\NI'm just wandering around.
Oh, I'm so jealous!
If I was off duty right now,
I'd be wandering around\Nand having fun, too!
Looks like you're\Nalready having
enough fun as it is!
So, are you on your own today?
Yeah, just me, myself, and me.
That makes two of us!
Huh?
\NLucky Star.
I'd\Nrecommend balsamic vinegar,
but if you don't have that,
you can use rice vinegar.
Balsamic vinegar?
Balsamic vinegar.
Balsamic vinegar.
You know how during\Nsummer vacation,
you get really,\Nreally bored because
there's nothing to do?
You sorta get used\Nto being super lazy.
So, if you're\Ntoo busy being lazy
and doing nothing,\Nyou won't be asking
to see my homework.
Ah!
I know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, it's really\Ncute how it's kinda
pudgy and all rollie-pollie\Nand everything.
I mean, it totally looks\Nlike a frog, doesn't it?
I know, it does!
Uh huh, oh!
So it's depleted\Nuranium, that's amazing!
Oh, hey, if I'm on\Nthe phone too long,
I'll get scolded.
Yeah, okay bye!
I was talking to\NKona-chan, and I asked her
why you get bored\Nduring summer vacation.
You know what she said?
Mm-mm.
She said she wasn't\Nbored 'cause she was busy
playing all the games that\Nstacked up during school.
I guess some people know how
to have a fulfilling\Nsummer vacation after all.
Maybe I should go\Ndo something, too!
Yeah, well, I\Nguess that's okay.
But do your homework!
As long as you do that.
Oh man, same old story.
I'm gonna pull one.
De-buff 'em, okay?
Oh, that's cool,\NTeach just logged on.
Hello.
You're online a lot, is\Nit because of vacation?
I have some time, you\Nwanna go hunt things?
I'm in the cave over\Nby Chopalan Village.
You got it, I'll be\Nwaiting near the gate.
Huh?
Ma'am, could you not talk about
real world stuff\Nevery single time
we meet inside the gaming world?
Now she's scolding me, just\Nlike Kagami does every day.
Hey there!
It sure is hot out.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Come on in.
Hello.
Hey, you guys got\Nthe fan out today!
Well, like you said, it's hot.
Hang out and enjoy the breeze.
Yup, I knew it.
I totally knew you\Nwere going to do that.
Good morning!
Oh, Kona-chan's here.
What up?
Oh, you and your\Ngood mornings.
Do you have any idea\Nwhat time it is?
Oh well.
Isn't it hot, though?\N
What, you too?
Come on, everybody does it.
Well, I don't do it.
But Kagami, weren't you\Ndoing it this morning, too?
Told ya.
\NBusted by dad.
It looks like Comp\NFest is really popular.
\NWhat is that?
Each time you buy a manga\Nor one of these magazines,
you get an entry ticket.
Then, if you fill 'em\Nout and send 'em in,
they'll send you a\Nlimited edition quo card.
Really?
Every time I take my\Nmanga up to the cashier,
it's like I'm\Npossessed or something.
You were saying\Nsomething about
this quo card stuff\Nthe other day.
I swear, the\NJapanese are helpless
when it comes to giveaways\Nand limited editions.
That's why when you\Nbuy something like that,
you always get\None for the vault,
one to look at, and\None to loan out!
Yeah, but you're talking\Nabout how you handle it!
It's not like everybody\Nthinks the same way as you do.
And sometimes I forget\Nwho I loaned it to,
and then I gotta\Nbuy another one.
So don't forget.
So, do you think\NI could take a look
at the you-know-what?
Oh, homework!
Jeez, fine, I'll\Nteach you all the stuff
you don't understand,
but you're gonna have to do\Nthe rest of it by yourself.
Balsamic vinegar.
Kagami, I don't know this one.
Oh, with a problem\Nlike that, you just...
Kagami, I don't\Nunderstand this stuff
from here on down.
\NOh, close one.
Kagami--
You're not even thinking\Nabout it, are you?
But I am thinking about it.
Are you really?
Yeah, and I don't\Nunderstand any of this stuff
from here on down.
Then you aren't\Nthinking about it!
She never taught\Nme how to do these.
It's me!
Came by for a visit.
Yui nee-san, right on time.
Could you show me how\Nto do this problem?
Huh?
What's that, your math homework?
Sure, I'll help you do it!
Yeah, well, seeing\Nas how I'm supposed
to be a role model,
you shouldn't rely on\Nothers for answers,
because it won't\Ndo you any good!
Huh?
Homework sucks when you don't\Nunderstand the questions.
Whether you get\Nit or not doesn't matter,
just scribble down\Nwhatever seems right.
They just want you to\Nturn it in on time, see?
Oh, I get it!
Awesome.
But then, this strategy of\Nyours sorta goes against
the stuff you said before.
If I do it this way, it's\Nnot gonna do me any good.
Yeah, well, that's\Nhow I always did it.
I'm so tired.
I think I'll take a break
and go online for some\Nhot gaming action.
Half an hour of hunting\Nshould perk me up again.
Half an hour's not\Nbad, not bad at all.
Oh, a rare drop, no way!
Labatine, I've never seen anyone
with one of those things.
An ultra-rare item!
I got Labatine!
Okay, come, come!
I need to try this\Nsucker out, but where?
Cool, everyone's really excited!
I should go get us some\Nhigh-quality potions,
then pass them out\Nto all the guys.
But I'll need to go\Nback into town first.
We're gonna get fizzy!
\NLucky Star.
\NLucky Channel!
Hi, Luckies!
I'm your navigator,\NAkira Kogami!
Can you believe it?
Lucky Channel's on\Nits fifth episode!
And I'm so excited, I\Ncan't hold it in anymore!
Let me introduce my assistant,
who's getting lots of\Nface time on the show
and getting a big\Nhead because of it!
Nah, I'm just kidding.
The one and only\NMinoru Shiraishi!
Clap, clap, clap, clap.
I promise my head's\Nnot gonna get any bigger.
Anyway, folks, it's\Nan honor to be here,
and I hope I do well.
I'm the assistant,\NMinoru Shiraishi.
Now, as you know, we\Nget a ton of letters
every week from\Nfans just like you.
Today's hand-picked\Nletter was sent
by a U.S.S Gatoh in Tokyo!
Is this guy some kind\Nof or something,
I mean, he sent in,\Nlike, 50 of those things!
He's probably just some\Npoor, pathetic loser!
Anyway, here's what\Nthe letter says:
"Big hellos to Akira-san\Nand Minoru-san.
On Lucky Star, I\Nalways see Konata-chan
go online to play net games,
so I was just\Nwondering, Akira-san,
do you go online\Nand play games, too?
By the way, online\NI'm what you'd call
a net-gay, but I\Ndon't swing that way
in real life."
Wow!
Someone's got issues!
A net-gay?
What does he mean, net-gay?
Is that short for network game?
I never play those things.
You're better off not\Nplaying 'em, Dorothy.
That was blunt.
Uh, why do you think that?
'Cause there's tons of people
who get so hooked\Nthey totally give up
their lives in the real world.
Betcha didn't know I\Nused to be that way.
Whenever I had time, I'd log on
and go on these super-long\Nhunting sessions,
or I'd just PKK some people.
Yeah, but that's\Nwhen I was younger.
When you were young-er?
I mean, those terms\Nyou were using,
I didn't understand any of them.
It's better if\Nyou don't know 'em.
Whatever, it's not\Nlike the audience
is gonna understand any\Nof this stuff either.
Yeah, anyway, you used\Nto play those things.
Maybe you could, y'know,\Nshare some memories
you might have had as a\Ngamer with our audience?
Oh, right!
Here I go!
Memories!
When I was just a beginner,
I didn't understand anything\Nand got into some trouble.
Then these guys who\Nwere experienced gamers
came and helped me out.
Then they pitched\Nin and gave me lots
of really expensive armor\Nand super-rare stuff!
I was the happiest\Ngirl in the world!
I'll bet you were.
I had so much fun, I\Ntotally want everyone
to go online and\Nstart playing now!
Oh no, it's time to go!
Bye, nii!
Yeah, well, see ya next time!
So, I guess you're\Npopular in the world
of online gaming.
Uh, Akira-sama,\Nsomething wrong?
\NOn page 38, scene 12...
\NUh-huh?
Who the hell\Nis Yutaka, dammit?
\NYou're getting mad about that?
\NMy name's Akira, damn you.
Akira!\NRight, I know--
\NWho's in charge?
\NWhere's the director?
Get the director!
Get the producers!
Akira-sama, you\Nhave to calm down.
--I am calm.\N--I beg you!
--I got an idea.\N--Yes?
Let's take the\Nname Minoru Shiraishi,
then we turn it\Ninto something else.
Something like--
\NYou're so cool, Kagami.
\NAh, thanks.
Tsukasa, Miyuki,\Nwho's gonna go next?
\NI am!
\NAgain?
Give someone else a chance!
\NYou can't hesitate,
we're on the clock here.
Time's money.
\NSorry, I'm still looking
for a song I know, I'm sorry.
\NOh, it's okay.
Let her sing, it's a good way
for us to kill some time.
\NOh, I know this song!
\NI didn't think Konata'd pick
a song from a popular show!
On the next\Nepisode of Lucky Star:
Konata here, when I started\Nplaying Monster Hunter Dos,
the rule was that\Nyou had to defeat
at least five geanos\Nto use a weapon, right?
So, what did I do?
Yep!
I went back to the village\Nand had the gathering hall
offer me the quest.
But even after I\Ndefeated the five geanos,
even when I picked all\Nthe snow mountain grass,
even after I got all\Nthat popona tongue,
I couldn't go back\Nto the village.
That's when I realized I\Ncouldn't access the storage box,
so there I was, getting\Nboned on reward points,
and it's all because\NI didn't read
the user's manual!
I couldn't save any money.
Kinda makes you wonder if that's
how the real world\Nworks, doesn't it?
Next time, fixtures of summer!
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay, let's do this.
\NSure, let's go.
\NGrr!
\NQuit screwing around and start!
Summertime! Beach time!
Before we leave, ma'am,\NI want to make sure
you and my cousin are okay\Nwith driving and supervising.
\NOh, yeah!
That's interesting.
Hmm?
You guys must have\Na lot of time on your hands.
\NGrr!
Sorry if we're taking you away\Nfrom your day off.
Oh, no, it's totally cool.
Narumi-san, is it true\Nyou're a police officer
in the traffic safety division?
That's right! I'm the expert\Nwhen it comes to traffic laws.
-He passed me.\N-Huh?
Damn him!
Hey, wait,\Nyou're supposed to be a cop!
\NShe goes nuts when
she's behind the wheel\NShe's out of control.
And we just sacrificed\NKagami and Tsukasa to her.
Oh, come on now.\NShe's a police officer, right?
Hmm? Hey, that's weird.
They were there a second ago.
No, Teach, you're going down\Nthe wrong street!
It says one-way, look!
I can't believe I got\Nit wrong both times. Curses!

Nanako-san,\Nyou're a good driver.
A really good driver.
Huh? You think?
It's funny, but I always\Nget motion sickness
when riding in cars.
Today, I brought along some\Nmedicine that would keep me
from getting sick.\NBut you see, Nanako-san,
because you're a skilled driver,\NI didn't get sick at all!
Huh?
What am I doing talking to you?\NWe gotta get outta here!
\NOkay.
Guess we should find a hotel.
Wow!
It's so sunny outside.
It's perfect for swimming.
I swear, yesterday I didn't\Nthink we'd ever get here alive.
\NI'm going to put my swimsuit on
and wear it down to the beach.
Sometimes you can be so\Nchildish, Konata--
\NNo way, you can't be serious.
Hey, aren't you a little old\Nto be wearing
your school swimsuit in public?
Not if you're catering\Nto special interests, Kagami.
\NWhoa, how old is that thing?
Hey, do you really\Nneed one of those tubes?
I mean, you're so athletic\Nand I know you can swim.
Just because I know\Nhow to swim doesn't mean
I have to jump in and start\Nswimming marathons.
There's a thing called leisure,\Nyou know.
Sweet leisure.
Since I'm trying to meet\Nthe needs
of folks with special interests,
I'm using this thing\N'cause it completes the outfit.
I don't think anyone\Nwith special interests
would go to the beach.
Hmm.
You always see people\Nsplittin' watermelons in manga
and anime, but it never\Nhappens in real life.
Naw, I've seen\Nthat happen before.
Maybe people think\Nit's a waste of food.
You got a point.
'Cause when you blow up\Nwatermelons with a shotgun,
you get pieces of watermelon\Nall over you.
You watch too much anime.
Miyuki-san, you're rich, have\Nyou ever split watermelons?
I can't say I've\Never done that.
Hmm, on second thought,\NI guess I can't really picture
rich people doin'\Nthat kind of stuff.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Oh.
Hmm. That figures.
Nothing happens in real life\Nthe way it does in manga.
I'm so sorry\NI disappointed you.
So it's like, you know,\Nwhatever. Man, it's so sad.
Here we are at the beach\Nand we have to babysit.
We're a couple\Nof lonely single ladies.
-You got it all wrong.\N-Oh, yeah,
you could compromise\Nand lug something
like that around,\Nbut that's no fun.
Give me a bunch of girls\Nand I'm a happy camper.
-You know?\N-But I'm not--
I hear more and more folks are\Ngetting married later in life.
Guess you and I've got\Nall the time in the world.
-Know what I'm sayin'?\N-You got it wrong.
The only reason that I'm here\Nis because my husband and me
have a commuter marriage.\NI'm married, married!
If the beach is a mecca\Nfor pickin' up girls,
how come no one's pickin' us up?
It's better this way,\N'cause no one's bothering us.
Besides, with you and your\Noutfit, the guys probably think
we're sisters on vacation\Nwith the parents.
-\N-
\NYokkoi Shouichi!
\NWhat's wrong?
Oh, you know, doesn't it\Nfeel kinda gross to sit down
when you're all sopping wet?
\NI know how you feel.
Maybe you should get\Ninto an air chair pose.
She doesn't need a workout.
Hmm...
-What's wrong?\N-My neck's tired.
I see.
Yes, I totally knew it!
What are you getting\Nso excited about?
We've just been served food\Nthat's the epitome
of the beach house experience.
Check it out, runny curry.\NThat's what I'm talkin' about.
You're right.
Isn't it weird how the things\Nyou'd never eat in everyday life
become amazingly delicious
when you eat them\Nin a place like this?
Woo-ha!
Chugging beers\Nat the beach is awesome!
Who cares if it's lukewarm?\NThis stuff's the best.
\NYeah, but they're pushing it
when they charge you\N300 yen for a lousy hot dog.
Yeah, right?\NThe thing's almost raw,
but who cares?\NYou still eat it anyway.
I kinda like how when you\Norder the fried chicken,
it's always really greasy and\Nit's got way too many spices.
The plain fried noodles\Nalso seem to be
much more delicious here.
Hey. Does the food here\Nreally deserve all the hype?
Uh-huh. But it's not as cool
as running down the beach\Nin a loincloth.
That supposed to be\Nanother anime reference?
\NI'm so hammered.
Looks like we're spending\Nanother night here.
Is that okay, Yui-neisan?
I've got\Nanother day of vacation.
It's cool, I'm fine.
The water's really cold.
Oh, come on, ma'am,\Nit can't be that cold.
You're just exaggerating.
Lucky Star.
-\N-Oh.
Why does your hair\Nalways feel so squeaky
after you've been swimming\Nin the ocean?
Well, maybe it's got something\Nto do with all the salt
in the water. Right, Miyuki?
That's true.
It's mostly caused by the salt\Nand also by the ultraviolet rays
from the sun.
But is that really\Nsuch a bad thing?
Your hair's always exposed\Nto UV rays anyway.
That's also true, but do you\Nreally want me to explain it?
Because I'm afraid it's\Nquite involved and lengthy.
Mm-hmm!
All right!
The reason your hair becomes\Ndamaged at the beach is due
to exposure to UV rays\Nas well as salt and seawater
and ocean breezes.
When exposed to these elements,\Nyour hair loses moisture.
Furthermore, if you sunbathe\Nunder strong UV rays,
the melanin in your hair\Nbegins to change,
causing your hair to lighten.
If salts or impurities, such as\Nchlorine from swimming pools
remain in your hair\Nfor any length of time,
it causes your hair\Nto turn brittle.
UV rays and impurities are\Nthe main cause
of follicular damage\Nduring the summer season.
However, the factors\NI've mentioned also cause
significant damage\Nto the hair's cuticles.
So, when exposed to strong\NUV rays, the cystine bonds
that preserve your hair's\Nstrength become--
Hey, guys, lookit.
♪ Timotei! Timotei! Timotei! ♪

Sometimes I wonder how\Nthe other folks see us,

Yeah, I guess.
\NThat's all you've got to say?

What's wrong, Kona-chan?
Looks like I just\Ntriggered a flag.
What are you talking about?
An event scene is gonna happen.
Remember, if you want to see\Nall your choices at the end,
save often.
I've going in, girls.
Picture's complete.
That's perfect. Bring it.
I had no idea.
You're such a geek.
No wonder today was\Nso totally boring.
What do you mean?
Did any guys hit on us today?
It's not like I-- You're the one\Nwho brought it up.
I wasn't obsessing about it\Nor anything, I was just saying.
That's why I brought up.
Oh, now I get it.
You wanted someone\Nto hit on you.
No, that's not it.
-\N-
Oh, no, I missed it!
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
I was just wondering what\Nyou did with unwanted hair.
Well, I'm kinda smooth all over,\Nso I don't really do anything.
Oh.
What do you do?
Ah! Who me?
I guess I'm kinda normal.
Hmm.
Actually today was kind of risky\Nfor me, if you know what I mean.
No, I don't.
It was almost time for my...
-\N-...you know what to happen.
Oh, I get it.
But it didn't, so that's good.
Were you okay\Nwith yours today?
Mm-hmm, it missed me.
Mine ended just last week,
so I guess you could say,\Nit was perfect timing.
It's such a hassle when\Nyou want to go to the beach.
Yeah, I know.
It sucks when you can't go\Nin the water because of it.
But you could always use\None of those thingies.
Yeah, right, but you\Nstill worry about it.
I've never used\None of those things.
-Hmm.\N-
Someone's having a blunt\Nconversation.
What if we are?\NIt's not like you never--
You're kidding!
What are you lookin' at?
Oh, nothing.
\NThe story I'm about to tell you
really happened.
A man who worked for a video\Nsoftware wholesaler left work
one night as he usually did.
It was especially dark\Nthat night
as he got on the bus\Nto go home.
This man lived\Non the edge of town
near where the bus route ended.
One by one the passengers were\Ndropped off, but the man,
he was alone, riding through\Nthe inky blackness
on this especially dark night.
The bus so was empty\Nand so quiet now,
the driver thought he was alone,\Nbut he wasn't.
And then...
...he sang "Danzen! Futari Wa...\NCure" in a really loud voice!
Anyhow,\Nthat's the way I heard it.
-\N-
Huh?
Oh.
Oh, wow,\Nwasn't that a scary story?
Yeah,\Nactually it was...
I'm Sukekiyo!
Where the hell did\Nyou get that thing?
Good night, sleep well.
Okay, then, good night.
Inugami clan!
I love scaring Tsukasa.
Go to sleep, already.
\NHey, let's bail!
Oh, okay.
\NI don't have anything
funny to say now.
I'm Tsukasa. I'm Tsukasa.
-Kagami!\N-Huh?
-What's wrong?\N-It was so scary.
I believe the girl has\Ntaken another step on the path
toward womanhood, Kagami.
Huh?
Man, this year's Comp Fest\Nis gonna be huge.
The Japanese are suckers\Nfor limited edition stuff.
If labeling stuff as\Nlimited edition is enough
to boost sales, they should\Nslap it on everything.
Well, if they did that, it\Nwouldn't be limited, would it?
\NThough we asked around,
and the truth is\Nthat if you drink...
Don't forget, girls, make sure\Nto clean up your rooms
before your vacation ends.
Wow! Cool! It's my old\Njunior high textbooks.
Hey, sis, look.\NCheck out this old photo album.
Look at this weird\Npicture of Dad.
\NYeah, when I saw that,
it made me wonder\Nabout his thing.
You guys look like\Nyou're having fun.
How's the cleaning going?
Let's see.
Hey, do you want\Nthese clothes?
Oh, yeah, sure,\NI'll take them.
Okay, I'll leave them here.
Thanks, sis.
Hey, you want this?
Sure, if you don't want it.
How about this? And this?
\NWait! Is she using me
as her trash bin\Nor something?
You always end up\Nflipping through
old photo albums instead.
Yeah, I know, I know.
When I find an old magazine,\NI can't help but read it.
That's just what I mean.
Hey, where's Tsukasa?
Oh, you know my sister.
She has a hard time\Nthrowing anything away.
She's still cleaning.
Yeah, she seems like the type\Nwho totally keeps everything.
Although, you seem to be the\Ntype who throws everything away.
You know, this negative image\Nyou have of me is really
starting to piss me off, girl.
Wow, you kept all of your\Njunior high textbooks?
What, you mean you\Ndidn't keep yours?
Oh, no, I left all of that stuff\Nbehind along with my memories.
No, take them home.
You're causing trouble\Nfor the school.
At last,\NI finished my cleaning.
Even though there's stuff\NI know I'll never use again,
I remembered the times I did,\Nso now I can't throw them out.
Well, that's just\Nthe way some people are.
They want to keep everything.
You're that type\Nof person, Tsukasa.
You seem to be the type who'd\Ntoss stuff that could be useful.
I mean, you still leave\Nall your textbooks behind.
Miyuki, you know you really\Nshould go and get
your teeth checked before\Nschool starts up again.
I know that I should.
It's just that I don't\Nthink that I could.
Well, if that's the case,\NI'd feel really bad making you
head all the way down there.
If you can't go to the dentist,
we'll just have\Nthe dentist come here.
No, please, wait a minute!
\NLucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
Time for the sixth episode\Nof "Lucky Channel."
Can you guys believe it?
I am Akira Kogami and I hope\Nyou guys are getting used
to this segment\N'cause I sure am.
That's lame.
Did you say something?
Oh, well, it looks like my\Nassistant, Minoru Shiraishi,
still isn't used to this.
He must be nervous 'cause\Nall the people are watching.
I'd really like it if\Nhe'd get used to his job.
Especially when he's\Ntalking to his superiors.
I mean, how many times does\Na girl have to remind him
before he gets it, you know?
It's irritating!
Anyway, on today's episode,\Nwe're going to introduce you
to a key character\Non "Lucky Star."
It's Konata!
Shut up, you pussy.
Why me? I didn't ask for this!
Miss Konata Izumi is 17.
She likes games,\Nanime, and manga.
Yes, and according to our\Nsources, she's always watching
the new shows and\Nreading the latest manga.
On weekends, she spends her\Ntime gaming online till dawn.
So, you're saying\Nshe's an "otaku."
Well, yeah, I guess she is.
Huh...
Hurry, do something.
You know those crazy otaku,\Nthey never leave the house.
They're always crying\Nwhile watching
the "Dog of Flanders" and stuff.
How dated is your idea\Nof otaku anyway?
You do your homework or what?
Can you handle your job, guy,\Nor what?
Well, umm...
Well, it's true that both\Nthe "Dog of Flanders"
and cute "moe" characters both\Nhave a healing effect, you know?
But girls like me are way\Nbetter than some mangey dog.
These days, the public\Nreally wants to see
cute, innocent girls, right?
When I look to the right,\Nthey look to the right.
If I look left, they look left.
They wait in line all night\Nbefore a concert
and they don't take a bath.
They stink so bad it makes\Nyour eyes water
and yet, they still\Nwant to see me.
That's what drives them.\NStanding like cattle
in the heat, burning under\Nthe damn sun waiting for me. Me!
Waiting until the bandanas\Naround their heads get so sweaty
and it's all for me!
But in the end, I guess they\Nare the customers, though.
Even if they insist\Non telling me their life story
at a handshake session.
And even if they do make\Na few off-topic comments,
you sympathize with them,\Nyou know?
'Cause in the end,
the only reason I'm here\Nis 'cause of folks like that.
I gotta do my best up here,\N'cause those people are my fans,
you know?
Is that what it's\Nreally like for you?
Oh, you'll find out real soon.
Being an idol is the hardest\Nthing you'll ever do.
Oh, yeah, once you've been\Nthrough the best and the worst,
you'll see what it's all about.
Some client or fan you hate\Ncomes up and you gotta smile.
Oh, that was fun!
Okay, did everybody get a good\Nidea about who Konata-san is?
Yeah? Good! Then I'll see you\Nagain in the next episode.
Bye-nee!
\NUh, actually today's show was
more about otakus\Nthan Konata-san.
\NUh, are you okay?
\NYou do it.
\NHuh? Oh sure!
At that moment,\Nthe reporter saw...
Now that's lame.
\NYeah! That was awesome.
Kage rules!
\NOkay, calm down.
So, Tsukasa,\Ndid you pick a song?
\NYep, I did.
I can't wait to hear\Nyou sing, Tsukasa-san.
\NI hope I can sing it good.
Hey, Miyuki,\Nwhat are you gonna sing?
Oh, I don't\Nknow that many songs.
It's a little embarrassing.
Ooh!\NThat's what she picked, huh?
\NGo for it, Tsukasa-san!
\NL-O-V-E, lovely, Tsukasa!
\NOh, jeez.
\NL-O-V-E, lovely, Sayuri!
\NWho's Sayuri?
\NWhoo-hoo!
\N♪ Oh baby! ♪
\NThe name isn't Sayuri Kuninama.
\NDoes anyone know who Sayuri is?
What was her\Nmembership number again?
\NYou're ruining the song.
-\N-
On the next episode\Nof "Lucky Star..."
Kagami here.
You know how\Nwhen you've got a hangnail
and it's just wiggling around?
You want to pull it out,\Nbut you think it's gonna hurt,
so you don't, but then you do\Nand it comes out and it's bigger
than you thought and it hurts!\NThen there's scabs.
You try to time it so it doesn't\Nhurt when you peel it off,
but then it starts getting\Nitchy and you think,
"Sure that sucker's ready\Nto rip, let's do this."
So you go slow, peeling\Nfrom the sides first and then
you just rip through the center\Nand you end up bleeding anyway.
And then you're like,\N"That's gonna leave a scar."
Next time: "Image."
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay, let's do this.
\NSure, let's go!
Quit screwing\Naround and start!
It feels like forever since\Nwe last wore these uniforms.
Oh, look, it's Kona-chan.
Kona-chan, good morning.
Well well,\NKagami-san, Tsukasa-san.
How do you do? Kiran!
Uhhh!
My, Tsukasa-san,\Nit seems that your ribbon
has been tied crooked.
Thanks a lot.
Gross.
What's wrong, Kona-chan?\NYou seem different.
Ah, yes, as of late I've found\Nmyself completely obsessed
with Marimite.
Marimite?
Grow up already!
Ha, ha, ha!
Ah ha ha ha!
So now what?
You're not gonna start\Ndressing like a character
from that show?
Let's see. Isn't that cosplay?
Don't worry. I'm not\Ngonna take it that far.
You sure about that?
Yeah, besides, I already\Ndo a ton of cosplay at work.
That's right. She works at\Na place like that, doesn't she?
Wonder what she'd be\Nlike as a classy lady.
Hmm.
That's so wrong I\Ncan't even picture it.
The baseball broadcasts are\Nrunning longer and longer,
why do the fans\Nof new anime have
to be the ones getting\Nhosed all the time?
If watching anime is\Nthat important to you,
why don't you get\Ncable or something,
don't they have channels\Nfor that kind of stuff?
Ha, you know if I could\Nget it I totally would,
but the cable guys all\Nsay the same thing,
"We don't provide\Nthat service here."
Hi, Yuki-Chan, good morning.
Hello, Tsukasa-san,\Ngood morning.
Why are you so gloomy?\NDid something happen?
I had to have a cavity\Ntaken care of the other day.
Oh, so you went to the\Ndentist? That's pretty brave.
Why is it that when\Nyou go to the dentist
to get some work done,
you find yourself\Nreturning there again and again?
You're so right!\NI totally know how you feel.
It's never just one or\Ntwo trips, it's way more!
Miyuki-san, how do you do?
Oh Konata-san, how do you do?
I trust you're\Nhaving a good day.
Yes, thank you for asking.
Wow, Miyuki-chan's amazing.\NIt doesn't sound
weird when she talks\Nproper like that.
She doesn't even notice that\NKonata's talking that way.
This is the first time\NI've ever seen anyone greet
someone else with\Na "how do you do."
Oh, is that so? At the all-girl\Nhigh school that my other
friends attend, it's common\Nfor them to greet each other
with a "how do you do."
Wow. Schools for well-to-do\Ngirls are something else indeed.
So very elegant.
Hey, so teach\Ntold me to collect
your homework\Nfrom summer vacation.
Very well then, Sebastian.
Seba-- who?
I would assume all butlers\Nare named Sebastian, no?
I guess that's one\Nway of looking at it.
Say something\Namusing, Sebastian.
\NNo way.
Well, your\Nvacation's over, people,
but now's not the time\Nto be spacing out.
Y'all should be thinking\Nabout the future while your
divin' head first\Ninto your studies.
The future, huh?\NWhat am I gonna do?
I mean, now that I'm halfway\Nfinished with high school.
Oh, come on, Kagami,\Ndon't tell me you're seriously
thinking about your future?
Huh?! What's that\Nsupposed to mean?!
Well, for one thing, you did\Nchoose the liberal arts route
so you could be\Nin the same class as us.
Tsukasa, you tattle-tale!
Sorry.
And of all the people you,\Nyou tell her?
Aw, you could\Ntell us, be honest.
You're a lonesome\Nlittle girl, aren't you?
There, there, it's okay.
Shut up you!
High school, high school.
Yoo-hoo! I'm here\Nto hang out with you!
Onee-san, it's the homework\NI did over vacation,
I did what you said and wrote\Nthe answers that seemed right,
even though I didn't\Nunderstand the questions,
and now I'm being forced\Nto do it all over again.
You've gotta help me!
I guess I could, but then,
if I help you, they'll just\Nmake you do it all over again.
I think you know what I mean.
Curses.
You don't get an extension\Non summer vacation,
but you get one on the homework.
I better borrow Kagami's notes.
Listening to the cicadas\Nalways puts me to sleep, oh!
Huh? What the-- huh?
Aha! The baseball game went\Nlate, so the schedule's off.
Huh, guess something good\Ncan come of it after all.
Wait! My recorder's timer's off.
\NHuh?
Where are\Nyour glasses, Yuki-chan?
Well, you see,\Nthey broke this morning,
I had placed them on my\Nchair and forgot about them,
it was an accident,\NI'm terribly sorry,
may I borrow today's\Nnotes from the two of you?
Of course!
You're still as clumsy\Nas ever, keep it up!
Konata-san, you're\Nhandwriting is so mysterious.
Tsukasa-san, keep trying!
I swear it's like those two\Nare totally useless, here.
Thank you so much.
It's a good thing we have the\Nsame teacher or you'd be stuck.
And could you please keep\Nthis a secret? It was such
a nice gesture and I'd hate\Nto pour cold water on it.
\NI'm starving!
Are you ready to have\Nlunch with us, Yuki-chan?
Tsukasa-san,\NKonata-san, here are your notes.
Thank you so much for them.
Not at all, no need to\Nthank us, we're happy to help.
I never thought I'd be\Nlending you my notes, Yuki-chan.
I was so surprised.
Doubt it'll\Nhappen again though.
Ah! Mmm! Stare.
Uh, what is it, do I\Nhave something on my face?
In games when characters\Nwith glasses come to school
without glasses,\Nthey suddenly become popular.
But I guess that doesn't\Nhappen in real life.
Ah! No I guess\Nnot, unfortunately.
Anyone else think choco cornets\Nlook like drills?
Huh, drills?
That's right! I just\Nremembered we were talking about
which end of a choco cornet's\Nthe head,
and how the thin end\Nkinda looks like a butt.
Hmm, although\Nif you look again,
the thicker end looks\Nmore like the butt.
A butt?
Well, that's a big butt,\Nand a layered belly.
When you gain weight on\Nthe lower half of your body,
trying to find a skirt that\Nfits you is really difficult.
Yeah, right! When it fits\Nyour waist it doesn't fit
your hips, when the skirt\Nfits your hips just right,
the waist is all loose.
But you can't help it,\Nso you buy the one with
the loose waist, and then\Nwhen you're out walking,
the skirt starts spinning around\Nuntil it's backwards.
I know!
A layered belly\Non a cornet body.
Flip it to the side\Nand it's a sleeping body.
If you sleep too much,\Nyou'll get a cornet body.
Let me know when I'm\Nsupposed to laugh, okay?
Hey, sis, didn't you\Ngo on some kind of diet
to get rid\Nof your summer pudginess?
Yeah, I did, but even\Nthough I lost some weight,
I didn't lose anything\Non my waist or hips.
No, Kagami, it did work.
I can totally see\Nthe fruits of your diet.
Really?
Yep, the difference\Nis crystal clear.
They say that when\Nyou go on a diet,
the places where you don't\Nwanna lose weight
are always the first ones\Nto go bye-bye.
Cut it out!\NDon't even go there!
So when you read literature\Nthe idea is to always
be thinking about\Nthe message that
the author is trying to convey.
\NI see, I see, I see.
I heard that\Nif your eyesight's bad,
you look like you're glaring\Nand it freaks people out.
But then again,\Nit depends on the person.
Hold it right there!\NYou looked at me when you said
it depends on the\Nperson, didn't you?
I heard that when you\Nmake your eyes all narrow,
it makes you look pretty.
You get this wistful faraway\Nlook, or something like that.
Wait, what are we doing?
Konata's late,\Nshe should be here by now.
Where the heck is she?
Oh, there!
I'm here, I'm here!\NSorry I'm late.
Oh you think?\NYou know, for someone
who's always complaining\Nabout ball games running late,
I'd think\Nyou'd be more punctual.
Yeah, well, you know, lately\Nall the games have been
going over so I guess\Nmaybe I caught the bug too.
What, like the flu?
Well, what's the story,\Nwhy are you late? Slept in?
No, no, it's not that.\NI'm not a child.
Then I can't wait to hear\Nthe grownup reason you're late.
Well, okay, when I got ready\Nto leave the house to come here,
I noticed that\Nit was still early,
and I had some time to kill.\NI figured "yeah." So I started
playing this game,\Nand then I just couldn't stop.
Even for a child\Nthat's a crappy excuse.
Now that we're in\Nour second trimester,
we've got the arts festival\Nand sports festival coming up,
and exams right after.
You'll do great at the\Nsports festival, Kona-chan,
'cause you're so athletic.
Sports festivals\Nmake me tired.
Yeah, well, it's rare\Nto find a homebody like you
who's in such good\Nphysical shape.
I wonder what our class is\Ngonna do for the arts festival?
I don't think there's\Nanything anyone wants to do.
We can't really\Ndecide on anything to do
unless somebody steps up and\Nsays they wanna do something.
But the person who does\Nalways gets stuck putting
everything together so\Nnobody says anything.
And then the only time we have\Nto do anything is after school.
And then we get home late\Nand miss all the anime.
\NWhere have I heard that before?
Lucky Star!
Since dad's put me in charge\Nof cooking the dinner tonight,
I gotta go grocery shopping.
Yeah? So what\Nare you gonna make?
Everyone's favorite,\Nchicken curry.
Everybody in my family\Njust loves chicken.
Chicken curry, huh?\NThat sounds good.
You know, I heard once that if\Nyou let curry sit out overnight,
it gets yummier.
I heard that too. I know what\NI'll do, I'll make a little
extra and then I can have it\Nfor lunch tomorrow.
We always have leftovers.
\NHiiragi residence.
\NUh, Tsukasa.
\NKona-chan?
It's so early. Anything wrong?
\NYeah, it's the curry.
\NCurry?
\NThe curry I made yesterday,
I left it out overnight,\Nand it spoiled.
\NWhat? No way.
\NWay.
But why? Curry doesn't\Nusually go bad overnight.
I\Nknow.
Did you put\Nsomething weird in it?
\NNo, but this morning there
was mold all over it.
So cornets for lunch again?
I don't mind.\NThis thing's tasty.
Well, as long as\Nyou're okay with it.
Wait, hang on a second.
You know, I just\Nrealized something
about the kind of lunches\Nyou guys bring to school.
Some days you bring\Nproper lunches,
and other days you\Nbring simple lunches.
Why's there such\Na huge difference?
Oh, well, that's because\NTsukasa and I always take
turns making the lunches.
Hmm.
Stuff like lunches always\Nend up being kinda simple
'cause I'm not that good\Nat doing housework.
There, I'm simple.\NHappy now?
Yes! Kagami, you're the\Ntype of person who makes pots
and pans explode\Nwhenever you cook.
Relax, nobody can do that.
Wow, Yuki-chan, your lunch\Nlooks super tasty today.
\NReally? Oh, I just packed
some of last night's leftovers.
\NOh!
\NDinner at Mikyuki-san's house.
\NIs really fancy.
And these\Nare just the leftovers.
Hey, um, everything\Nlooks so good,
what's the filling\Ninside the fried eggs?
\NOh, well, we had eel last night,
so I just put that\Ninto the eggs.
\NYou never see leftover eel.
Moldy curry's\Nthe only leftover at my house.
Well, your house\Nisn't really normal, is it?
--Good Morning.\N--Hi.
Hey, you.
Look, look, my parents\Nbought me a cell phone.
That's pretty cool of them.
Yeah, I did really good\Non my exams this time,
so they got it for me.
Well, now that you\Nfinally got one,
give me your number\Nand I'll give you mine.
Sure, I just gotta\Ngo find my number.
Let's see.
Hmm.
Uh, sorry,\Nthis'll take a second.
Oh, oh!
I didn't know you had\Na cell phone, Konata.
Except I keep it at home 'cause\NI always forget to bring it.
Besides, my dad's the only\None who ever calls me.
Then it's pointless for you\Nto even have a cell phone.
Oh, yeah?
--Kerororo.\N--Whoa!
Isn't he cute?\NMom and Dad bought him for me
with the cell phone.
That reminds me,\Nthere's this girl in my class
who's got a ton of straps\Nhanging from her phone.
She decided to weigh it\Nto see how heavy it was,
and the straps alone\Nwere like 800 grams.
Oh, wow, that's a lot.
That's heavy.
Once she took the straps off,
her shoulders didn't hurt\Nanymore.
Think about it,\Nevery time she made a call
or answered the phone\Nshe was working out.
It's weird, but cell phones\Nalways make me nervous,
you never really know know\Nwhen they're gonna ring.
Really.
Oh, I hope somebody calls me\Non my new cell phone.
You're losing it\Nover a cell phone.
These days they're\Nnot that big a deal.
By the way,\Ndid you ever find your number?
Oh! Oh, not yet.
And in England,\Nthe House of Lancaster and
the House of York began a series\Nof civil wars for the throne.
On the battlefield, the armies\Nof Lancaster wore red roses,
and the armies\Nof York wore white.
That's why it's called\Nthe War of the Roses.
The fighting started\Nin 1455 and went all the way
to 1485 and that's when--
Uh, what is that?\NIs that my cell phone?
Oh, I finally got a call.
Huh? Who's this?
Okay, confiscated.
You can pick it up at\Nmy office after school.
Yay! She gave it back to me.
It sucks that your first\Ncall was a spam text.
Hi, oh, hey, Dad,\Nyeah I'm still at school.
Just hanging out\Nwith Konata and Miyuki
and lost track of time.\NYeah, I'm fine.
I'll be heading home in\Na little bit. See ya.
That always happens even\Nif I'm a little late.
--\N--
Hello? Oh, hiya, Dad,\Nyeah, I'm still at school
with Kona-chan\Nand the others, yeah.
You think he'd figure it out\Nafter calling one of us.
Fathers always worry\Nabout their daughters,
it's what they do best.
Can you believe how\Nmuch spam you get these days?
You just need\Nto change your address
to something that's\Nnot too obvious.
I changed mine,\Nand it's all good.
Not too obvious, huh?\NGimme an example.
Well, I got my address\Nwritten out to say
"meganekko geki love" in romaji.
What I really wanted was\Nsomething with maid in it,
but addresses with maid-san\Nand miko-san are so popular
they've all been snapped up.
Wait, you don't\Nhave to broadcast it
to everyone on the bus.\NI got it, I got it already.
The stuff you're talking about\Nis worse than the spam problem.
Good morning!
Hey, you.
Oh, why are you crying?\NWhat's wrong?
My poor little cell\Nphone, it never hurt anyone.
She sort of forgot\Nto take it out of her pocket.
Aw, then it's gone on\Nto a much better place.
They'll never buy me\Nanother cell phone again.
Oh, he made it\Nthrough unscathed.
Persistent little guy.
Oh, hey, about that text\Nyou sent me last night.
You know the one that said\Nsomething about how Kagami
wanted me to return her\Nhomework notes today?
Was that the last\Nmessage you sent?
Yeah, that was the\Nlast, did you reply to it?
Huh? Let's see.
How come it's so hard for you
to return a simple\Ntext message?!
I never reply to a text\Nwhen it's from someone
I'll be talking to later on.
You're supposed\Nto reply to those things.
I see you every day. What's the\Npoint in going to that trouble?
You're gonna lose\Nfriends that way.
Ah, it's not like it's\Nso important it can't wait.
How can you say that?
Huh, after all\Nthe back and forth,
I still didn't\Nget my notes back.
\NTsukasa, can I come in?
--Oh, hey, sis.\N--Ha!
--\N--What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
This manga I borrowed\Nfrom Kona-chan made me weepy.
Good morning! Thanks\Nfor letting me borrow the manga.
It was really cool.
Yeah, wasn't that silly,\Nbet it made ya laugh.
Huh? But it was so touching\Nthat it made me cry.
It's hard to believe you guys
are talking about\Nthe same manga.
Here if you cry,\Nyou're on Tsukasa's side,
but if you laugh,\Nyou're on my side.
No way.
I don't wanna be classified\Nwith either one of you.
I think it'd be kinda neat\Nto see how you react to it.
Oh, is it really\Nsuch a bad thing to
wanna know what your\Nfriends are all about?.
Here's an idea,\Nattack number...
--\N--did you cry or did you laugh?
--I laughed.\N--I cried.
Okay, what's your\Nfavorite manga?
\N"Keroro Gunso."
I can't\Nreally tell if these
guys are the same\Nor not anymore.
Why don't you join the manga\Nclub or something, Kona-chan?
I mean, you like manga.
Yeah, I guess I wouldn't mind\Njoining up with those guys,
I'm pretty sure they've\Nat least got flexible hours.
Draw draw draw draw.
What the,\Nyou call this drawing?
Mm-hmm.
I got a question, this thing\Nhere, who's it a picture of?
\NThat's Tsukasa.
\NReally? That's me?
\NAnd that's Miyuki-san.
I guess you\Nsorta got the feel for her.
This is Kagami.
\NOh, I breathe fire, huh?
My, it's the spitting\Nimage of you isn't it?
What a scary little girl,\Nhow frightening.
Would you cut it out already?!
Oh, the new "Fullmetal"\Nbook just came out.
Yeah, the new issue of\N"Compti" came out today too.
I'm gonna swing by Gamers\Nnow, do you guys wanna go?
Oh, sorry, I think I'll just\Ngo by the local bookstore today
I got errands to run.
But you have to come with\Nme to Gamers today 'cause
it'll nurture\Nthe friendship between us.
Stop it. What's up with you\Ntoday? You use a word like
friendship and it doesn't\Nfit you at all.
Oh, yeah, that, I was\Njust trying to get you to
give me all your\Npurchase points
by appealing to your sense\Nof loyalty.
So that's all\Nmy friendship means to you?
What a crock.
\NLucky Star!
Man, it's quiet,\Nis she mad I used
the sunflowers\Nfor the pigtail gag? I wonder.
\NHuh, what, who me? Huh?
You want me?
Akira-sama? Me?\NOh, okay, got it.
Hey, um. I think we're\Non the air right now so uh...
if I don't do somethin' now\Nthey're gonna change--
Hiya, Luckies! Or you know,\Nhowever she says that line.
Okay, guys, Lucky Channel's\Non the air again this week
and I'm Minoru Shiraishi,\Nthe assistant.
Akira-sama's in a bad mood.
Ha!
How dare you introduce\Nyourself before introducing me,
Akira Kogami. Do you not\Nunderstand what rank is?
No, I was--
--\N--Huh!
I've noticed you've\Nbeen getting quite
popular around here lately,
you and those pigtails.
Me? Popular? No not at all.
You're so full\Nof yourself, it makes me sick!
I'm terribly sorry!
First off, everybody\Nwas expecting
the Akira fashion project
to showcase me,\Nyes, me and my pigtails.
What are those?
You're right,\Nyou're absolutely right!
Hmm, I'm gonna\Nwear twin drills.
You're kidding, twin drills?
Don't underestimate\Nthe speed of the getter.
Number two, huh?\NPigtails are over.
The next big thing is\Ngoing to be twin drills.
Didn't Konata say in episode two
that a drill is kinda\Nlike a guy's, you know?
Did she now?
All righty, everyone, we're\Ngonna straighten this out
on our radio show\Nand on our website!
So, until the next episode.
Bye, me!
--So...\N--Yes.
\NThe pigtails.
\NOh, the ones I had.
\NThe ones in the picture.
\NYes.
--Were those sunflowers?\N--They were.
I think I've\Nseen those somewhere before.
\NWhat do you mean?
--Years ago...\N--Whoa! Hang on a sec!
--One of my first--\N--Gero gero! Gero gero!
\NBoy, was I nervous.
It was very cute\Nand very well done.
Don't you get nervous\Non the first song you sing?
You think "am I gonna sing this\Nsong good enough," you know?
\NYour turn, Miyuki!
I'd like her\Nto sing "Omoide Ga Ippai."
\NWhy that one?
Would you please\Nhand me the mic?
\NHere. Good luck!
Umm, I don't\Ndo this very often,
so I'd like\Nto apologize ahead of time
if my singing hurts your ears.
\NDon't worry, you'll do great!
\NWow, good one!
I totally get the\Nconnection here. Nice, Miyuki.
\NOh, her voice is awesome!
This is a new kind of moe\Nand it's workin'.
\NYuki-chan, you're so cool!
On the next episode\Nof "Lucky Star"...
Tsukasa here!\NWait, time's up?
Next time "Energetic\NDespite Not Being Myself."
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay, let's do this.
\NSure, let's go!
Quit screwing\Naround and start!
Today's the warmest it's\Nbeen all autumn, and all over
the country school athletic\Nfestivals are what's happening.
Yeah, I just came\Nto cheer my daughter on,
but who knew it'd\Nbe this exciting?
I mean, the trip\Nwas well worth it!
Let me tell you, some of\Nthese pictures are amazing!
Oh, Dad.
I wonder whose daughter\Nyou're talking about.
I don't know. Maybe I should\Ncut my hair for the festival.
Just chop it all\Noff really short.
Ah! Why do you want\Nto cut your hair?
It's taken you forever\Nto grow it out!
Uh, I wasn't serious,\NI was just thinking.
Such a profound\Nresponse must mean...
It's about a guy, isn't it?
Don't relate\Neverything to that!
And don't talk so much, Tsukasa!
But if Kagami did\Ngo and cut her hair...
Isn't the\Nsuper slim Pocky the same
as regular Pocky?
Don't do it!
Pigtails are the classic\Ntsundere hairstyle!
\NSorry, my face is so boring!
Oh, yeah, the\Nathletic festivals' coming up.
What a drag.
I never thought\NI'd hear a teenager say that.
You're good at sports,\NKona-chan, so you'll do great,
but someone like me?
I'll just get in the way.
--Aww!\N--You're gonna be fine.
Hey, sis, which event\Nare you gonna sign up for?
I totally know what\NKagami's gonna pick.
The bread-eating race!
If I didn't know better,\NI'd say you're trying
to pick a fight with me.
All righty then, what event\Nare you going to sign up for?
Uhh.
Was I right? I was, wasn't I?
Pissing me off!
I guess you could\Nsay I've been doing
some training for the festival.
Autumn is the season\Nfor sports, you know.
Really?
The question is, are you really\Ndoing it for the festival,
or are you doing it\Nfor the event thing
that happens after it?
What event thing?
You want me to say it?
Really pissing me off!
So, Miyuki's gonna be running\Nin the relay race, huh?
That's understandable.
You're tellin' me.\NBut get this,
at first, she was gonna do\Nthe obstacle course!
Okay, does anybody else\Nfeel like volunteering?
Though I've never done\Nthat before,I'll do my best!
But you can't, Miyuki-san!
Huh?
With those curvy curves,\Nyou shouldn't be doing
the obstacle course.
You'll have to squeeze through\Nthings and go over stuff.
After that, she got\Nswitched to the relay.
That sounds like something\Na middle aged guy would say.
Do you remember\Nback in junior high?
Did your school ever\Nhave any scavenger hunts?
Yeah, we did those.
One time a guy\Nwho was doing it
came up to me with his list.
Me?
The weird thing is, he was\Ntoo embarrassed to tell me
what he wanted to scavenge.
I wonder what it was.
There are so many unspeakable\Nthings it could be.
Well, I could ask Miyuki-san.
She might have an idea.
Leave her out of it,\Nthere's no easy answer
for a question like that.
She asked her anyway!
Something about you\Nthat's hard to mention
that might be the item\Nin a scavenger hunt?
Mm-hmm.
It's only speculation,\Nbut perhaps
it's the mole on your face.
One could consider that\Na sensitive subject.
Figures, she's a master\Nat dodging difficult questions.
But I'm sure she's wrong
I do enjoy\Nthe athletic festivals,
but after that we\Nstill have exams.
I think it's kinda sad 'cause\Nafter the festivals' over
we run out of things to do.
The midterm proficiency\Nand finals exams
are all we have left!
And you always wear yourself\Nout in the second trimester
'cause of the arts\Nand athletic festivals.
Yeah.
The midterm is going to\Nbe especially difficult!
I heard that Autumn's\Na good time for reading,
so maybe I'll read some books.
The climate this\Ntime of year is also
excellent for studying.
And right before\NChristmas is when they
bust out all the new games!
Although we have\Nfinal exams before that.
\NOh, yeah, and then there's--
Hold it! How about\Nthe two of you
stop avoiding the inevitable?
That's right! It's almost\Ntime for the athletic festival.
Do you know that pistol\Nthat starts the events?
I always thought\Nthat was a real gun!
I never figured it out
--till junior high.\N--You've gotta be kidding.
No, I think seeing\Nthat is what made me
want to become a cop\Nin the first place.
You chose your career\Nbecause of a misunderstanding?
Oh, by the way, Konata,
when's the school athletics\Nfestival happening?
Here, it's this Sunday.
Augh! This Sunday?
How come you didn't\Nsay anything?
Why didn't you tell\Nme this before?
But, Dad, we just\Ngot the flyer today.
I'd better get ready.
What's up with your dad?
All right, people,\Ntoday's the real deal.
You're gonna get out\Nthere and show 'em all
the fruits of your labor!
Yeah, ma'am? I haven't labored\Nthat much but don't worry,
this stuff's gonna\Nbe a piece of cake.
Don't get cocky!
The cavalier race is where I\Nwant you to give 'em all hell!
Attack the enemy\Nfrom all sides
and pound 'em till they holler!
Wouldn't it be better if\Nwe found their weak spot
and pounded that\Nuntil they holler?
But all we need\Nto do is take their hats,
I don't know about pounding.
Relax, don't sweat\Nthe small stuff.
That's one of the mistakes\Nyou make when you're a kid.
'Cause you're just a kid.
We're rooting for you, sis!
Do your best out there!
Hey, do either of you know\Nhow they get the red bean buns
to stay on the strings?
Most likely the\Nbuns are attached by
some sort of clip or something.
Oh. I guess it'll make it\Nharder to pull them off then.
Just remember you're a girl!
And as a girl you\Nmust win elegantly!
There's nothing elegant\Nabout a bread eating race!
-Get set!\N-
Aah!
She did it!
Yup, that's our Kagami.
That man's camera\Nis really amazing.
My dad. He's so easy to get.
Hey, aren't you running\Nthe 100 meter dash?
It's coming up.
Yeah. I guess.
Kona-chan, can you teach\Nme how to run fast like you?
Just imagine yourself winning.
It's all about visualization.
\NOn your mark!
Get set!
That's some\Nold school visualization
you got going on.
Goal!
Kinda like that.
You're kidding.
Three meters, 25 centimeters.
If you fall\Nback they only measure up
to where your hands hit.
-\N-Oh, yeah!
That's Kagami.
The sand's not even\Nsafe from her jabs.
\NOne two three, one two three.
I heard that to run\Nthe hurdles you have to
time the number of your steps.
I don't get it.
One, two, and three and jump!
Oh, now I get it!
One, two, three,\None, two, three.
Get set!
Three, two, three,\None, three, huh?
Wait, I started off\Nwith my right foot so that's
two, three, one!
I'm not getting it!
I'm on my left foot now, so--
Wait! What is it?
Three, two, one, augh!
Stunning. She's plowing\Nthrough every single
one of those things.
She's got a knack for it.
I guess I suck, huh?
No, listen, I thought\Nmy daughter was in that race.
I didn't know, honest!
Same old, same old.
Time for the last relay race.
Yuki-chan,\Ndo your best out there!
You've got it all wrong,\Nmy daughter goes to this school!
Hang on, I haven't\Ndone anything!
Yeah, way to go,\Nyou can do it, run!
All right,\Nwe're in second place!
We're doing pretty good then.
Over here, Sachi!
Here! Got it!
We're in third place now.
Now this is what\NI call a race!
They're putting\Nup a good fight!
It's getting interesting.
I wonder if Yuki-chan's\Ngoing to be all right.
Got it.
Whoa!
Go, Miyuki!
All right, Yuki-chan,\Nyou're so awesome!
That's our Miyuki-san.
She even remembers to give\Nthe audience fan service.
\NLucky Star.
Hmm. Okay.
Is that Tsukasa?
Oh, man.
Happy Henry likes beer,\Nbut could not obtain food.
Hey, uh, could you do\Nsomething about that noise?
Sorry about that!\NI'm playing the alto recorder
in music class,\Nbut every time I play a note,
it feels like I'm\Ngonna pull a muscle!
Why did you choose\Nthe alto part?
Well I sort of thought\Nthe lower parts
would be easier to play.
Oh. Well, how about you\Nget your fingers used to
the recorder by\Nplaying a simpler song?
Oh!
You're missing\Nmost of the notes.
Just try to follow\Nwhat I do, okay?
Ready, and...
Whoa, hang on, Tsukasa,\Ntry it by yourself.
That doesn't seem right somehow.
When you're playing,\Ntry relaxing a bit more.
Maybe you'll play better if\Nyou're not as tense, you know?
Okay, just relax.
Yep.
I'll give it a shot. Here we go.
She's sucking in more air\Nthan she's blowing out.
I'd eat in the cafeteria more,\Nbut every time
I come here,\Nit's always super packed.
If I don't get\Nsome food, I'm gonna faint!
Standing in line\Nalways makes me tired.
Man, this blows.
Aren't you used\Nto this kinda stuff
from all the cons you go to?
Yeah, but if there's nothing\Nexciting at the other end,
waiting in line sucks!
Well, at least you stay true\Nto the things you like.
That reminds me, the other day
I went to an amusement park.
I thought I was in line\Nfor one of the attractions,
but I was actually\Nin line for the restroom.
You're always\Nsupposed to check what you're
lining up\Nfor before you line up!
I was standing\Nin line for hours.
Oh, you know, when I get\Nstuck standing in a line,
the person in front of me\Nends up buying the last
of the thing I wanted to buy.
Actually,\Nthat happens to me a lot!
You're just unlucky, Tsukasa.
Do you all know what you're\Ngetting for lunch today?
How tragic. Oh well,\NI guess curry's good enough.
I think I'm\Ngonna go with ramen.
Ooh, me too!
I was craving some miso\Nramen today with lots
of corn and seaweed.
That's what I'm gonna get.
You also gonna get\Nthe eclair and the flan pudding?
Only if I have\Nroom for dessert.
You always have\Nroom for dessert.
\NWhat are you getting?
I think I'd like\Nto have a sandwich today
with some strawberries.
That totally sounds\Nlike something you'd have.
-Yeah.\N-Hang on.
Just throwin' this\Nout there, but isn't
a strawberry sandwich dessert,\Nor can you even call
something like that lunch?
You do have a point there.
You get picky about\Nthe weirdest things.
Oh, what about the choco cornets\Nyou're always eating?
Wouldn't they be\Nconsidered a dessert?
How dare you\Nquestion my choco cornets?
Well, now that that's settled,
I've got some bad news\Nfor Miyuki-san.
The line for the sandwiches\Nis over there.
That's typical of her.
That girl is moe incarnate.
Oh, look, Kona-chan,\Nyou're up next.
I'd like some curry\Nplease, with extra sauce.
You got it!
I admire your cunning!
Hey, I'll take\Nwhatever I can get.
Okay, next?
The soy ramen please,\Nwith sort of firm noodles.
Okay, it'll just take me\Na minute.
Sorry about the wait.\NHere you go.
I'll go ahead and grab\Nus some seats, okay, guys?
-Okay, thanks!\N-Okay, thanks a lot!
\NOkay, folks, who's next?
I'm next, may I please\Nhave the miso ramen?
Oh, I'm sorry,\Nthe person ahead of you
just got the last\Nof the noodles.
We're all out of\Nramen for today.
If you don't mind\Nhaving soy flavored ramen,
you can have mine.
I can always get\Nthe kitsune udon.
Thanks sis, you're the best.
I just thought of something.
Hmm?
You get to be the older\Nsister because
you were the one\Nto pop out first, right?
That's right.
I'm so glad I get\Nto be the younger sister!
Okay, why's that?
'Cause its kinda sad\Nif the older sister is
asking the younger one\Nfor help with homework
or if she's asking to copy it.
When it comes to\Ncopying homework, I don't think
any of that matters anyway.
Look, we're twins,\Nso I don't think there's
any difference\Nas far as age goes.
Don't worry about it.
Just hurry up\Nand finish your homework.
Okay!
I wonder how it would be\Nif I were the older sister
and I was all reliable\Nand stuff like her.
Oh, please, sis,\Ncould you show me your homework?
Again? Come on, Kagami,\Ndo I even have a choice?
-You gonna be okay over there?\N-You're so amazing!
You're spazzin' out.
Ta-da!
New Type has published\Nmy very own postcard!
It's gonna be in the May issue!
"Konata Izumi from Saitama."
Wow, that is pretty cool.\NCan't believe they printed it.
Huh?
I mean awesome, girl, amazing!
It's a once in a lifetime thing!
I know, isn't it?
Now I got another reason\Nto pick up a copy!
A bunch of copies!
Don't worry,\NI'll still be your friend.
This one's 1,260 yen,
and this one's 567.
If I get another book,\NI'll get another point.
I'll just pick one of these,\Nand then I'm good.
No, it's a trap.\NThat's what they want you to do.
But I'm way too smart to\Nlet 'em do me like that.
Making me buy something\NI don't want just so
I get an extra point?
I'm so on to their little game.
Ha ha ha. What do they\Nthink I am, stupid?
There's no way I'm gonna\Nfall for that old trick.
Whoa!
I totally forgot\Nvolume five was out!
Yes, please, this'll do.
That'll be 2,587 yen, please!
Eh, whatever.
-They're stuck,\N-Oh, I'm so sorry!
Looks like they\Nwanna stay together, huh?
I always stuff\Nlike that only ever
happened in manga and games.
Looks like they happen\Nin real life too.
Yeah, you think?
You know what?
Those two totally\Ntriggered flags back there!
Konata, fantasy isn't\Nreality, it's illusion.
Try not to mix them up, okay?
\NLucky Star.
\NLucky Channel!
Hiya, luckies!
Delivering tons of love\Nwith a dream-colored heart!
I'm your navigator Akira Kogami.\NWelcome to Lucky Channel!
Hi there, I'm Minoru Shiraishi,\Nthe assistant!
Wow, it's already\Nthe eighth episode!
Isn't it crazy how\Ntime just flies by?
I heard that!
We should start thinking about\Ngetting some new material
or folks'll start saying\Nwe're stuck in a rut!
What was that?
What am I gonna do,\Nwhat am I gonna do?
No, I was thinking about\Ntrying some new stuff is all.
-You said it.\N-You know, yeah.
Oh, by the way, when I was\Nwalking around the other day,
someone called me over!
Was it a survey for a day spa?
Oh, come on now, Shiraishi-san,
do you know what you're saying?
Of course you don't\Nknow, see, it was a fan.
But you don't know about fans\Nbecause you don't have any!
Right?
Ah! No, I don't have any fans!
No, of course you don't!
You're just an assistant, right?
Keep up the hard work,\Nassistant!
But I do have a couple\Nof fans, look! You see?
Augh! What the--
What the hell, Edo,
where's my fan letters?
Why you...
Just one freakin' letter?
"Your membership is about\Nto expire, please respond by"--
This is junk mail\Nfrom the video store!
This is a shout out\Nto all of you guys
sitting in front of the TV!
Please send me some fan mail\Nor I'm gonna cry!
I want want want\Nyour letters, okay?
Shouldn't we be starting\Nthe show now, Akira-sama?
Don't be so damn conceited.
It'd be easy\Nto replace you, feel me?
Sorry, ma'am.
Tada! We have\Nan announcement!
We're gonna be taking\Ncharacters from the show
and making super cool\Nfigures out of them!
Akira-sama, the board!\NIt's upside down!
Oh, ha! You're doing it\Non purpose. You're so funny!
Let me tell you guys how it's\Ngonna work this time around!
Peel, peel, peel.
Don't touch me.
Heh, this is totally weird.
So, here's how it's gonna\Nwork this time around!
Don't touch me.
This damn time around!
Peel, p-peel, peel! Ugh.
Hey! What the hell, you guys?
Hey, what the-- You're blocking\Nmy close-up, Joe!
Get the hell out of my shot!
Get your ass out of the way!
This is all your\Nfault, isn't it?
No, it's not!
Oh, hi! So about this\Nfigure project thingy,
we're gonna need you\Nguys to vote on it to see
which character's gonna be\Nturned into a figure, okay?
We're waiting for your opinions\Nso don't disappoint us,
you got it?
Make sure you\Nguys vote for your favorite!
Whoa! It looks like we're\Nall out of show for today!
I hope we see each\Nother again next time!
Bye-bye, me.
It's obvious someone\Nfrom the main segment
is gonna get this one too.
What am I, some kind of freak,\Na friggin' clown?
Nothing has\Nbeen decided yet.
Actually, they are making\Na figure out of me.
The hell you talkin' about?\NWho said you wer--
\NMiyuki-chan, that was amazing!
\NI'm sorry it wasn't better.
That's a side of\Nyou I never thought I'd see!
Oh, please,\Nyou're embarrassing me.
Oh! Yuki-chan,\Nlet's sing something together.
\NI'd love to!
\NYeah, go for it guys!
Sing a duet!
\NWhat do you wanna sing?
Let me see...
While you\Ndecide, I'm gonna rock the mic!
You're\Ngonna sing again?
Yeah, Kagami,\Nand you should sing more too!
-\N-What's this?
Saiyuki! Masaaki's\NSon Goku was the best!
Didn't\NShingo-chan play that character?
Yeah, like\Nthe third time they did it.
This is the theme song from\Nthe original 52-episode series
that ran from 1978 to 1980.
Yes, did you feel that?
\NHow old are you?
This is a long intro.
This is the\Npart where Octogawa-sensei
goes into his awesome narration!
\NI don't know who that is!
\NOh, here it comes!
Ataaaaaa!
\NMore shouting?
What the-- that's\Nnot even English, I'm out.
You got us\Nall worked up for nothing.
On the next\Nepisode of "Lucky Star"...
Miyuki here.
When one is attempting\Nto illustrate the size
of something that\Nis incredibly large,
they'll use the term\Nsuper D class to describe it.
The "D" stands\Nfor the "HMS Dreadnought,"
a battleship of the English Navy\Nthat was activated
into service in 1906.
Now then,\Nthe term super D class,
or super Dreadnought class,\Noriginally referred to anything
that was larger than\Nthe HMS Dreadnought.
Well, that was the original\Nmeaning behind the term.
These days, however, the term\Nis used mostly in the context
that I described to you earlier.
Next time, "That Feeling."
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay, let's do this.
\NSure, let's go!
Quit screwing\Naround and start!
Now that autumn's here, it's\Nthe perfect time for reading.
So, I've been reading\Nlots of books.
Whoa, that's unusual.
I know it's good for me,\N'cause I'm gettin'
all this knowledge, but it's\Nstarting to get expensive.
You don't have to buy them,
just go to the library\Nand check 'em out.
I'll bet they've got a lot\Nof stuff you'd like.
No, a library\Nwouldn't really carry
that big a selection of manga.
Reading books, huh?
Reading books.
I just\Ncan't concentrate.
Well, everyone needs to take\Na breather now and then.
A little gaming\Nshould help me relax.
Oh, Miss Kuroi's online.
"How's it going? Stop messing\Naround and start studying
'cause you know I'll yell at\Nyou if your scores suck."
\NCurses! They got me surrounded.
Please, Teach, have mercy!
Playin' my game's no fun when\Nreality comes a knockin'.
Sigh.
Quick question, ma'am,
when you were in school\Nand had to study for a test,
what'd you do\Nwhen you got bored?
"When I couldn't concentrate,
I went and goofed off\Nor I slept. Nothing special."
\NThat's what I do.
"But I'm your teacher,\Nso I've got to be hard on you."
\NI get where she's coming from,
but it still blows!
If I want to good at school,
I have to set some goals\Nand work my way up.
So, could you teach me all\Nthe stuff I don't understand?
Sure, we can study together.
So for this one,
the value of "X" is gonna\Nbe equal to--
What?
Nothing, I looked at the clock
and realized my\Nshow just started.
Tonight's episode is\Nwhen this magazine
writes an article about\Nthe main character
and then everybody finds\Nout that she's pregnant.
I see.\NAre you gonna watch it, then?
Mmm.\NIt's okay I'm recording it.
Boink.
I know!
I get sleepy when there's a lot
of stuff I don't understand.
Guess you've been sleepy\Nthe whole time then.
Maybe I\Nshouldn't overdo it
right off the bat like this.
I think I'm gonna call it a day.
Okay, but it looks\Nlike your ambition
needs to do some catching\Nup with your goals.
I still\Ncan't concentrate. All right!
Oh, you say you'd like\Nsome tips for studying?
Yep, I was sort of wondering\Nif you had any advice for me.
Let me see.\NYou tend to burn yourself out
if you concentrate\Ntoo hard on something.
I find that when studying,
if I stick to my usual habits,\NI'll be fine.
I'm feeling confident\Nabout that test today.
It's like I've been\Nenlightened or something.
But your usual habits consist\Nof you not doing anything,
so what's the big deal?
Oh, you mean even if\Nit's really, really cute?
Yep, and you gotta\Nwatch out for their claws
'cause they're poisonous.
My, I didn't realize they\Ncould be so utterly frightening.
--Howdy, guys.\N--Huh?
Hey, Kagami, how'd\Nyou do on the test?
Yeah, I didn't do\Nso hot this time,
but my grade was still\Nin the top percent.
Even you have rough\Npatches, don't you?
You know, this time she\Nhelped me study for my test.
And I got a really good\Nscore too, better than usual.
So, how did you do on it?
Even though I was pretty\Nconfident, I didn't do so good.
It's kind of a mystery.
No mystery there.
Inevitable's a more\Naccurate description.
Anyway, I was thinking\Nabout how we're sort of
like birds of a feather\Nflocking together.
-Hmm?\N-Think about it.
For one thing,\Nboth you and Miyuki-san
are class representatives,\Naren't you?
-Yeah.\N-And then, you and me
both like to play\Nvideo games, right?
Yeah, but we don't\Nplay the same genres.
You like dating sims and RPGs,
and I like to play\Nshooting games.
I used to think Tsukasa\Nand me were the same,
but after this test\NI can see the difference.
-She's not as dumb.\N-
Well, I'm not going to worry
too much about blowing\Nthe test this time.
You should definitely worry.
Just 'cause no one did well,
doesn't mean it's okay to slack.
You'll get left behind.
Hmm.
Hmm?
Actually, this time around
me and dad didn't bet\Non anything anyway.
So, I've got nothing\Nto be upset about.
I seriously doubt you're
ever gonna amount to anything.
If you're gonna to look to\NMiyuki for studying tips,
try taking more notes\Nand not just when exams hit.
I think Miyuki-san\Nis very sensible.
She's definitely\Na Type "A" person.
You know I hear\Nthat from a lot of people,
but in reality\Nmy blood type is "O."
Really, "O"?\NYou don't look it.
Well, actually...
...according to this book
on blood types and\Npersonality traits,
I have many of\Nthe characteristics
of a person with type "O" blood.
I'll find an example.
Here, it states that type "O"\Npeople are childish and naive.
That description fits me\Nperfectly, don't you think?
"Type 'O' people also tend to be\Npushy, stingy, and greedy."
Ah, I didn't know you had\Na dark side, Miyuki-san.
Aren't you a Type "A" person?
Yeah, although a lot\Nof people mistake me
--for a Type "B" person.\N--Huh?
"The Type 'A' person is sensible\Nand considerate to others,
and they also create\Npeaceful relationships."
Are you sure about this?
I'm a caring and sensitive\Nperson, don't you know?
Only about the things\Nyou're interested in.
I'm gentle and kind\Nand love everyone.
Only when you need\Nto copy homework.
Hmm.
Okay then, what's\Nyour blood type?
Who me?\NI'm a Type "B."
"Blood Type 'B,'\Nsomeone who's rude, contrary,
moody, thoughtless,\Ndisjointed, and slacking."
Got a problem with it?
--Then, Tsukasa's a Type "AB."\N--Huh?
--Why do you say that?\N--Yeah, why?
Just thinkin' out loud.
See, if you go by\Nyour personalities,
Tsukasa looks like a Type "A"
and Kagami looks\Nlike a Type "B."
Nice theory,\Nalthough we're both Type "B,"
and we're sort of twins,\Nso there's that.
Yeah, that's right.\NMy bad.
And while we're on it, you're\Na bigger slacker than I am.
There are several ways\Nof predicting personality types,
such as using animals\Nor even sushi.
\NSushi?
Here is what Miyuki-san is.
Ooh, Miyuki's ikura, huh?
Even her sushi's classy.
Goody, I just love ikura!
So, how about me and Tsukasa?
\NMmm.
\NCucumber roll.
A cucumber roll?
Well, I guess it is\Nconsidered to be sushi.
This thing is petty accurate.
What does that\Nthing say about you?
I wonder.
Ginger...
You're ginger!
Don't be dissin' the ginger!
She's right, ginger is\Nan essential component
to any sushi meal.
Besides, her outlook seems\Nto be a favorable one.
Yeah, Miyuki's right.
Cucumber rolls are more\Nlike sushi than ginger.
Oh.
Hey, Konata, so about\Nthat blood type stuff
we were talking about today.
Well, fraternal twins can\Nhave different blood types.
I didn't want you\Nto think that you were wrong
when you weren't, but I\Njust wanted to let you know
you were right about it, so...
Well, thanks for\Nbeing so honest.
That's pretty cool of you.
I guess there's Type A\Nin you after all.
Oh, check it out.
The other day, I saw 'em do one
of those psychic readings on TV.
Yeah, you know\Nwith that kinda stuff,
the guesses hit\Nthe mark sometimes,
but sometimes\Nthey're way off too.
It's all a part the show.
Statistically speaking if\Nyou make enough guesses,
you're bound to get\Na few of 'em right.
Kagami, do you realize\Nthat if you keep saying stuff
like that, your life is going\Nto be the most boring ever?
Can't you act more\Nlike a teenager?
Wow, you did pretty\Ngood this time, Tsukasa.
Ooh, Kagami,\Nthis time you didn't
--do as good as you usually do.\N--
Even so,\NKagami still got a better score.
Hmm.
Well, girls,\NI know you both worked hard.
The two of you studied\Nand did your best
and I have to say\NI'm really proud.
Wow!\NYou did pretty good, Tsukasa.
\NBut Kagami did better.
No surprise there.
\NCome on, Matsuri,
can't you be\Na little more considerate?
Good morning,\Nma'am, how are you?
Good morning,\Ngirls, how are you?
The two of you are\Nsuch fine young ladies.
I really do envy you,\Nyou know that?
Not at all.
You're both Ryouou High, right?
I hear your grades\Nare so stellar.
If only I could get my child\Nto be half as smart as you.
It feels like\NI'm getting compliments
because I'm her sister.
Does that even count?
I don't know.
-\N-"Lucky Star."
\NSince we're done with exams,
how about we go out\Nand have some fun?
Yeah, good call.
You guys want to go\Nsee a movie or something?
Is there anything\Ngood playing right now?
There is,\Nand I hear it's awesome.
Oh, really?
Yeah, we're talking\Npremium entertainment.
It's a hybrid splatter film\Nslash psycho-suspense thriller.
Whoa, sounds good.\NLet's go for it.
We should go home and change
then meet up later.
\NSounds like a plan.
Let's get it on.
\NI'm not having fun.
I'm really not having fun.
We still have a couple\Nof minutes.
As usual, she's late again.
We're gonna miss the movie.
Oh, darn it.
For once, I'd like\Nto see Konata show up
before we do, you know?
Jeez Louise, the thing's\Ngonna start in a minute.
\NWhen'd you get here?
I didn't know it was\Nyou until I saw that.
Glad you could make it.
Now, let's get inside\Nbefore it starts.
Ooh, wait a sec.\NI need a favor.
Can you guys let me\Npose as your sister?
Why, what's the deal?
Well, I'm gonna get\Na children's ticket,
but I don't want\Nto get hassled going in.
Lousy brat!\NShe's always going off
about her height,\Nbut she totally exploits it
whenever she can.
That was\Nscary, Tuckabee.
Oh, man, you're so cute.
I could use some\Nfood right now.
I heard that.\NAren't you hungry
after all\Nthat screaming, Tsukasa?
Mm-hmm.
What do you want to eat?
Hey, how about we\Nhit up a cake buffet?
That sounds good.
A buffet...
...the sanctuary for all\Nthat a woman desires.
They sure have a lot of\Ndifferent cakes and drinks here.
Yeah, you're right.
I wonder if we can\Ntry one of everything.
Piece of cake\Nfor you, Kagamin.
First things first,\Nthere's a one-hour
time limit for each table.
You can find our\Nselection of drinks
over in the drink corner,
and you'll find\Nour various cakes
in the showcases over there.
So feel free\Nto take what you want.
-Okay.\N-Bow.
Oh, by the way,\Nif you can't finish
and have an excessive\Namount of leftovers,
you'll have to\Npay a separate fee
for what you leave behind.
I just wanted to give\Nyou ladies a heads up.
Okay.
Very good.\NPlease enjoy yourselves.
An excessive\Namount of leftovers.
Yeah, that's just\Nfor people who take way more
than they're gonna eat.
Let's go, I'm starving.
That's a lot of cake.
You gonna be able to finish it?
Speak for yourself, Kagamin.
When it comes to cake,
this a perfectly normal amount\Nfor me to have, thank you.
Let's eat some cake!
Ah!
Mmm!
\NAnd that one, and that one!
Mmmm!
Okay, this is\Nstartin' to hurt, now.
We kept filling up our plates,\Nand now we can't finish.
-Uh, I think I'm ready to pop.\N-Hmm.
But the lady said we'd be\Ncharged for the leftovers.
Yeah, we have to finish 'em.
I can't!
It's too painful.
Ah, our time's almost up.
Whoa, Kagamin, you're\Npounding two pieces at once.
Of course, I don't\Nwant to waste it!
--Don't do it!\N--Huh?
If you start\Ndrinking water now,
you're never gonna finish\Nwhat's left on your plate.
You gotta focus on shoving\Ndown as much cake as you can.
Pack it in and when you're done,
then you can wash it\Ndown with some water.
--Uhh.\N--Don't just sit there!
Pick up your fork\Nand suck down some more cake.
But I can't eat anymore.
You've got room\Nfor some pudding
or Bavarian cream, go on!
No, it's all you, have fun.
I'm gonna hurl if\NI take another bite, come on.
No way,\NI've retired from eating.
The pudding's gooey.\NYou can slurp it.
\NCome on, hurry up!
I'm not having fun.\NI'm really not having fun.
Now that our exams are over,
I've been doing some\Nserious game playing.
No wonder I'm so tired.
If you were only that\Nhardcore about studying,
your test scores\Nwould be better.
These days, the dating sims\NI've been playing
have a ton of save points.
Thing is, I can't find\Na good place to stop.
I like to finish those things\Nin one sitting.
Something's bugging me here.
If high schoolers aren't\Nallowed to buy games like that,
how the heck do you buy them?
I don't buy that stuff.\NDad buys it.
\NWhoa! Your family's gotta be
the weirdest family ever.
I can't believe you\Nmake your dad go out
and by that stuff for you.
That's why I'm all sleepy today.
I bet you're not that into\Ngaming, are you, Miyuki-san?
Oh, well, we don't\Nhave any game consoles,
but there is a computer.
I do play a little on that.
Yeah, that's news to me.
What kinda games do\Nyou like to play?
Things like "Minesweeper"\Nand "Solitaire."
I think those\Ngames are exciting.
Oh, Miyuki-san,\Nsure they're called games,
but they're not really games.
I know what you mean.
I like when you're playing\Nsimple games like those,
you get totally sucked in.
Yuki-chan, what's your\Nhighest score so far?
On "Solitaire," I usually\Nscore over 10,000.
It's all about luck\Nwith that game.
And then in "Minesweeper,"\NI cleared expert mode
in under 100 seconds.
\NAh, she's the type
who plays that stuff\Nall the time.
There sure was\Na lot of stuff happening
in sports this year.
Yes, for starters,\Nthat figure skater won
the gold medal\Nat the Winter Olympics.
And then, there was that high\Nschool baseball tournament.
Wasn't it amazing how they\Nhad to go into extra innings?
Mm-hmm, and how about\NPrince Handkerchief?
If you're talking baseball,
there's also that player\Nwho left for America.
Hey, is this year's\NJapan series already over?
Yeah, for a while.
Ahh! No way!\NWere there any sales?
Relax, the series was
between the you-know-who's\Nand that other team.
Neither of 'em owns\Ndepartment stores
or supermarkets\Nor anything like that.
There was\Na commemorative sale, though.
Hmm, I bet it was\Na sale on hammers,
something like that.\NMm-hmm.
I wonder if it was ham.
I just gotta make\Nsure that next year,
I don't miss the sales.
Well, knowing you,
I bet you're just gonna\Nload up on candy and stuff.
No way.\NI need to pick up stuff
like sugar, salt, soy sauce,
and all your basic\Nhousehold-y things.
Huh?
Oh, that's right, Kagami,
you wouldn't know about\Nany of that, would you?
I suck at chores! I got it!\NHa! Ha! Ha!
Eye drops, huh?\NYou need any help with that?
Thank you,\NI'd really appreciate it.
Okay, lie back and look up.
Oh, okay.
Hi... now just relax.
Yes.
Here it comes.
Come on, relax, okay?
\NAll right.
Sorry, I'm not doing\Nthis on purpose, really.
It's just that...
your face is scary.
Hmm?\NI've always had a problem
with giveaways and stuff,\N'cause it takes forever
to get the thing\Nyou sent away for.
True, however,\NI found a way to milk
twice the enjoyment out of every\Ngiveaway I participate in.
How?
It's always fun in the\Nbeginning, like a festival,
but then nothing happens\Nand you start to forget
about it and then it shows\Nup and you're happy again.
One entry and twice the fun.
I guess if you\Nreally like something,
you can find the fun in it.
But I still hate the\Nwaiting-around-for-it part.
\N"Lucky Star."
\NLucky Show!
Hi, luckies.
Hi, everybody, it's time
for another super happy\Nepisode of "Lucky Channel."
I'm your navigator,\NAkira Kogami.
Can you believe we're\Nalready on our ninth episode?
Time sure flies.
And sitting over here,\Nwe have a certain someone
who our producer,\NIto, is gonna say,
"Yo, Shiraishi, can you\Ncome here a second too?"
Why? What'd I do?
Oh, I'm Minoru Shiraishi\Ngiving 100%
of all I got as\NAkira-sama's assistant.
It's a pleasure\Nto see you again.
Well, today we're\Ngonna introduce another
character from the show,
Tsukasa Hiiragi.\NWhere is it?
It's under the thing with the--\Ngot it.
\NYou sound like a nerdy turtle.
-Finally--\N-Hiiragi-- I'm sorry.
Finally, things are\Npicking up around here.
Yes, we're strapping\Non our loincloths
and gettin' down to\Nbusiness, right, Akira-sama?
Loincloths, huh?\NYeah, since I'm an idol
and everything, stuff\Nlike that is a little,
you know. Just keep\Nit mind is all, yeah?
Yeah, I'll do that.
Okay...
how about we give\Nourselves wedgies
with those loincloths?
So, I'm just gonna\Ngo out on a limb here,
and give you a piece of advice.
You're out on a limb?
If all you got as a comedian\Nis toilet humor, you're done.
I didn't know\NI was a comedian.
And using other people's\Nmaterial is a no-no.
You do that a lot, cool it.
Okay.\NOkay, what are we talking about?
Oh, we were introducing\NTsukasa Hiiragi.
Oh, yeah, that's the one who\Nlooks like the chick from...
-\N-..."To Heart," Akari Kamigishi.
Doesn't she?
I can't believe\Nyou'd say that.
What'd you mean,\NI think she kinda looks
like an idol from way\Nback when, don't you?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
She does a little bit,\Nokay, I see it.
She definitely has what it\Ntakes to become an idol.
If I didn't know better--
Are you high or something?\NTsukasa Hiiragi's an idol?
You didn't have to\Nthrow an ashtray at me.
How long you been here, huh?
'Cause it blows my mind that\Nyou still have no concept
as to what a real idol is.
Learn your friggin' job.
-I'm sorry.\N-That girl is just
a soothing character type.
I mean, come on,\Nwith those droopy eyes
and that sad look, hello.
Okay, maybe she doesn't\Nlook happy.
Whatever, that hoochie's not\Nwhat's important right now.
I'm gonna teach\Nyou once and for all,
right here and now, what\Nan idol's all about.
We'll start with\Nthe posing basics.
Huh?
You know I'm doing this\Nto help you out.
So it would be freaking awesome
if you could pay more attention\Nwhile I'm flapping here.
-Yes, ma'am!\N-Here's how to deal
when you're ambushed\Nby a bunch of cameras.
Okay, go ahead,\Npush the button.
\NDroopy eyes and a sad look.
You see what\NI'm talking about?
And then, there's these\Nprops-- very essential.
It's a good thing for an idol\Nto keep a few of these handy.
-Where?\N-There's times you'll
be walking down the street\Nlooking fabulous.
You never know when\Nsomeone's gonna whip out
a camera and start shooting,\Nso you gotta stay frosty.
And make sure your choppers\Nare sparkly white.
--\N--Theater.
Your eyes should be\Nbig and round,
and don't even\Nthink about blinking.
--Confined to this area only.\N--Psycho.
When posing, your expressions\Nmust be natural and organic.
For example, if someone lines\Nup a medium close-up of you,
like this,\N"Akira so surprised!"
It's like that.
Right, very natural.
There's also a version\Nof that pose
for when you and some guy\Nare caught leaving a ho--
--\N--Oh no!
It's time to say goodbye\Nalready?
Now, don't you guys\Nforget to keep
sending in those cards\Nand letters.
We really, really want to know\Nwhat you think of the show,
and don't forget to let me\Nknow how much you love me too.
You can also shoot us an e-mail\Nor call into the radio show.
Yes, we'll be seeing you\Nall in the next episode.
Bye!
We had a photo shoot, didn't we?
That's right, we did.
I wore\Nthis little pink cardigan.
--Ooh! You were so cute.\N--Thank you.
--What's wrong?\N--Mmm, maybe not.
Well, everyone\Nsaid it was cute.
But you were\Nso into it, weren't you?
\NYeah, I guess I was.
\NBet you were having fun.
Well, I mean,\Nlooking up into the camera,
the hands folded\Nunder the chin pose.
Yeah, it was fun, yeah, yeah.
\NAhh, you're totally hooked.
Totally, even the\Ncross-dressing. Totally hooked.
\NDid you check the photos?
\NNo, I haven't.
--Well, the manager did.\N--Yeah?
-She checked the photos.\N--Okay.
She said something\Nabout a couple of shots being...
problematic.
Well, I wouldn't\Nworry too much about it.
I'm sure they got a ton of shots\Nof me where I'm really h--
\NSorry, that was a rookie move.
Let me make it up to you guys.
She says as\Nshe enters another song.
Give someone else a chance.
\NOkay, here.
You guys decide on something?
\NI'm still Looking.
\NI'm looking too, but I'm afraid
I don't know that many songs.
No sweat, I'll\Njust sing until you're ready.
You think you\Ncould sing something else
besides an anime song?
\NYou're in luck. It's not.
\NHuh? I heard this before.
What is it?
\NIt's Kyon Kyon.
Me and my dad used to sing it\Nall the time when I was a kid.
\NSo, instead of an anime song,
you picked an oldie.
What?\NYou're insulting Kyon Kyon
by calling this an oldie.
Look, Tsukasa,\Njust pick an easy song.
Like a children's song.
Oh, yeah. I'm looking\Nin that section. I'm so sorry.
No, it's okay.\NDon't worry about it.
We still got lots of time left.
On the next episode\Nof "Lucky Star"...
Konata here,\Nyou know how in World 3-1
in "Super Bleep Bleep Brothers"\Nwhen you get to the stairs
near the end of the level?
Well, there's that\Nturtle over there, right?
All you have to do\Nis stomp on it
and keep hitting\Nyour "A" button.
If you do that you\Ncan keep hoppin'
and jumpin' and\Nkickin' that sucker
and get pretty much\Ninfinite lives.
Cool, right?\NBut if you keep jumpin'
on that turtle\Nand go over 129 lives, you die.
That's it, game over.\NNo more lives.
What's up with that?
Hello, anyone else\Nsee a problem here?
Infinite lives means\Nyou live forever!
Anyway, I think it sucks,
but then again,\Nmaybe that's the point.
Maybe the guys in that building\Nby Tofukuji Station,
are trying to teach us a lesson\Nabout moderation, you think?
Next time, "Desires."
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay! Let's do this!
\NSure! Let's go!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
Look! They bought\Nme a new cell phone!
Make sure you don't put\Nit in the laundry this time.
You're right.
This time I'll keep it\Nwhere I won't forget it.
Tsukasa! Could you\Nhelp me out for a sec?
Okay. I'm coming!
--Ba...\N--
l...
...sa...
Irritated,\Nirritated, irritated...
--...mic.\N--...irritated, irritated.
--Vine...\N--Super irritated.
--...gar!\N--Really, really irritated!
Ah! That's\Nreally irritating!
Just type it in already\Nor let me do it!
\NNo, thanks. I'm okay.
I can do it myself.
I'm here to hang out!
Hey! Come on in, Onee-san.
Whatcha playin' there?
It's a dating sim\Nthat just came out.
Huh.
I think I'm gonna pick a manga
and read that for a while.
Okay.
Uh-oh. This game's\Ngot an age restriction.
Either she doesn't\Nknow or she does,
but she's letting it slide.
Okay. Come on, Officer,\Nwhich one is it?
Get this. We're having\Ntraffic safety week, right?
So we're taking in people\Nlike there's no tomorrow.
--Huh.\N--They're making us run
a check on every little thing,
and we gotta explain\Nall the traffic laws.
It's a big-time\Npain in the butt if you ask me.
And the people even get mad\Nat me for doing it!
\NKnowing you and how you act,
how's anyone supposed\Nto take you seriously
about laws and safety?
Can you believe it?\NI sure can't!
I hear the cold\Nthat's been going around now
is lasting a long time.
I need to get better, fast.
According to the number\NI've taken,
it looks as though\NI'll be here for a while.
I'll just read a book\Nuntil I'm called.
\NMr. Ando! Mr. Shigeo Ando!
\NMs. Takara! Ms. Miyuki Takara!
Ms. Takara! Is there\Na Ms. Takara here?
Okay. Is Ms. Mariko\NNishiyama here?
Huh?
What? Did they call me?
What time is it? Oh no!
I need to pay more attention\Nto my surroundings.
Coming up\Nis Kamata, our last stop.
\NHuh? Oh, no! It happened again!
Where am I?
But in the end I still\Nhad to show Tsukasa
how to send text messages\Nwith her phone.
Even after messaging\Nwith it so much
she told me she never\Nfigured it out.
--Really?\N--Oh, yeah!
And now that she knows\Nhow it's done,
she's been texting me non-stop
with anything and\Neverything she can think of.
It's gotta suck\Nto be on the receiving end
of all of those texts, though.
--No, not really.\N--
I mean, I'm not\Ngonna lose any sleep
worrying about it. You know?
Here's the thing.
At first she gets really\Nexcited about stuff,
but then she'll get\Nbored and move on.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
Some people can be\Nso childish sometimes.
Uh! I got another.
If she doesn't get bored soon,
you're gonna be hating life.
Wait. She can't have that\Nmuch stuff to text you about.
I know. And we're together\Nall the time anyway.
Oh! And she just\Ndiscovered emoticons.
You see?
"You wanna buy the soy\Nmilk cream buns again
on our way home today?"
Hm? What's all that\Nsupposed to mean?
I don't know if you can tell,
but she's really having fun\Nwith emoticons.
Might as well\Nbe hieroglyphics.
Mmm?
Huh. Looks like she\Ngot used to doing it.
--\N--Hm?
--\N--
--\N--Huh?
--\N--
--Okay.\N--Oh, jeez!
I get you're having\Nfun with it and stuff,
but you think you could text\Nsomeone else for a change?
Hey.\NYou guys got a minute?
Sure.
Well, I can't seem\Nto figure out
how to send these\Ntext message things
--from my phone.\N--For real?
Oh, Dad. That's super easy.
Can't believe you don't know.
Okay. I'll totally\Nteach you how.
Isn't it funny how\Npeople learn something new
then run out and brag about\Nhow much of an expert they are?
Uh, yeah.
There just aren't words\Nto describe that hard stench.
\NI know. It stinks so bad.
--Yeah.\N--Huh?
Wow. You sure got a lot of\Npeople in your address book.
--Don't ya?\N-Hey! Don't look without asking!
You got stuff you don't want\Nanyone to see or somethin'?
Not really.\NYou just don't do that.
It's a guy, right?\NIt's totally a guy!
No! It isn't a guy!
She's not picking up\Nher cell phone.
Guess I'll try\Ncalling the house.
\NHello, Kagami!
Hey, Konata?
You know. It'd be awesome\Nif you could answer
your cell once in a while.
Yeah. Sorry 'bout that.\NThe ringer's turned off,
so I didn't know\Nyou were calling me.
\NIt's pointless to have a cell
if you never know\Nanyone's calling.
Where the heck\Nis that thing anyway?
\NSee what I'm saying?
There's no point\Nin you even having one.
Yeah.\NSo, anyway, I wanted
to ask you about\Nthis coming weekend.
Wait. Hang on.\NDad's calling me.
Come on.\NWhat's the deal? Hurry up!
I'll be there\Nin a minute! Jeez.
You've been\Non the phone forever.
--Come on!\N--All right! Sorry!
Dad just chewed me up\Nfor being on the phone too long.
Oh, sorry.
I sorta always pictured\Nyour place to be kinda chill
when it came to stuff like that.
I guess\Nit's pretty strict, huh?
Nah. We're just\Nin the middle of playing
a cool fighting game, is all.
Ugh! Why didn't you say\Nanything about that before?
Whether they're old or new,
point cards have\Nmagical powers in here.
And then, before\NI know what's happening
I'm buying all this stuff\NI never planned on.
But you never plan\Non anything anyway.
I get what you're\Ncoming from, though.
She's here!
In this city you've got...
...Ani-- and G--mers
She comes into our store,
buys something,\Nthen goes to the other shop
to buy the same thing again!
She's the one known\Nas Legendary Girl "A"!
Heh.
Legendary Girl "A"\Nshift assemble!
\NYeah!
Welcome to the store!
We've got the "Haruhi"\NVolume 5 DVD in stock!
Limited Edition!\NStandard Edition!
We've got 'em both! Oh, yeah!
So, you want more stuff?
We've got stuff coming\Nin all the time!
\NYes, that's right.
Show her everything we've got.
The whole store.
She's gonna clean the place out.\NI can feel it.
Whoops. I was looking for\Nthe Limited Edition bookmark
from Aquarian Age.\NI gotta go Gamers.
This sucks!
\N"Lucky Star."
Awesome!
We'll have\Na sleepover this weekend
--and play games all night.\N--Cool.
Whenever we do\Nthis kinda stuff,
it's always gotta\Nbe at our house.
--How come we never go to yours?\N--Huh?
I'd just like to\Nsee where you live.
Hmm...
It's not that you can't\Ncome over to my house.
The reason I don't invite you
is 'cause my dad's always home\Non account of his job.
Oh. That makes sense.
Mm-hmm. Besides.
I don't wanna be\Nheld responsible
if anything happens, you know?
--No, I don't.\N--
I'm kinda looking\Nforward to seeing
what's Konata's house is like.
Hey!
Hi, guys. Come on in.
Thanks\Nfor letting us stay the night.
We won't be any trouble.
Oh! It's my pleasure.
I've heard so much\Nabout you guys.
Like that you live in a shrine
and that you're a couple\Nof shrine maidens.
\NWhat's she been telling him!
Ew! And this is\Nthe first thing he asks?
Here it is!
\NWow! Look at Kona-chan's room!
I gotta hand it to ya.\NYou're room's amazing.
Oh! She's so cute!
Where does this go?
Don't tell me.\NYou don't want me to open this
'cause it's where you\Nkeep all the crazy junk
you're too embarrassed\Nto put on display.
Go ahead and open\Nit if you want. I don't care.
If you're lookin' for\Nall my weird stuff
I usually keep it down\Nin my dad's study.
I share it with him.
Uh. You guys share it?
Didn't you say\Nyour dad was writer
or something like that?
--Yep.\N--I bet you probably get hooked
on the light novels\Nand dating sims your Dad writes.
--Don't you?\N--Oh, yeah.
Well, actually, my dad doesn't\Nwrite that kinda stuff.
--Oh, really?\N--Yep.
Huh. I didn't expect that.
Well, I mean. Since he's a fan\Nof stuff like that,
wouldn't he wanna write\Nthose kinds of stories?
No. My dad's\Nkinda like a lurker.
He told me he didn't\Nwanna write that stuff,
because he felt that,\Nsince his real life
was kinda like one\Nof those nurturing sims,
he didn't wanna write\Nabout it and live it too.
Ever since\NI got here, it's been weird.
Yep. That's the Izumis.
So, get this.
The other day, my dad was\Nbeing all clingy and stuff.
--Yeah?\N--So I'm all,
"You're actin' like an ass,"\Njust to see what he'd do.
Ugh! How can you talk\Nto your dad like that?
Yeah, well, after I said it,\NDad suggested I say,
"I hate you, Dad,"\Nor somethin'.
Yeah. I'm not sure\Nabout that either.
\NThat's the point.
I don't think you\Nappreciate the complexity
of my dad's way of\Nthinking, Kagami.
Whatever.\NYou totally lost me.
How 'bout we take\Na little break?
--It's here!\N--
Have you noticed lately,
how there's been a lot\Nof 2chan speak on TV?
What's up with that?
Oh. There has?
I wouldn't know\Nabout that stuff.
--\N--That's right!
I just realized you're\Nthis hard-core otaku,
but I've never heard\Nyou talk like that.
I don't normally.
But if I'm online\NI talk like this.
Whoa.\NIs that really Japanese?
I think I've\Nfailed if anybody can read it.
You want me to\Nhelp with anything?
Sure. Do you wanna\Nserve the salad for me?
Mm-hmm!
\NHuh?
\NThank you for the food!
Yummy!
Yeah, you're right.
This stuff tastes amazing!
Whippin' up stuff like\Nthis isn't a big deal
if you do your chores.
If you helped out\Nin the kitchen more, Kagami,
you'd cook like this too.
I don't need your advice.
Konata look! This is perfect!
Huh?
I always dreamed something\Nlike this would happen
and it has!
\NHuh?
--Oh, yeah.\N--
So, this is what's known
as the three high school girls
having dinner with\Na guy scenario.
And if you ask me,\Neven for dating sims,
it's freakishly overused.
That's, well...
Doesn't it feel like\Nevenings are getting colder?
Maybe I shoulda\Nbrought a jacket with me.
Look! A shooting star!
Huh?
Darn.
Tried, but I couldn't\Nmake my wish three times.
When they come out\Nof nowhere like that,
it's kinda hard.
But someday I'll do it!
I'll wish fast enough,
and then it'll grant me a wish!
You'll always be\Na dreamer, Tsukasa.
Too bad stuff like\Nthat's impossible
when you stop\Nto think about it.
Huh?
Whoever came up\Nwith it knew no one
could say their wish fast\Nenough for it to work.
This one has absolutely\Nno dreams whatsoever.
Are either of you guys thirsty?
Whoa!\NThank you.
You switched hairdos.
Yeah. What do you think?
We did it for fun\Nafter we took our bath.
Hmm. Isn't it\Nfunny how the vibe you get
from something on one person
is different when\Nit's on someone else?
Oh! A photo album!\NCan I look at it?
Sure, go ahead.
Wow! You're so cute, Kona-chan!
You haven't changed at all.
How old are you\Nsupposed be in this?
It's a cool shot.
I guess you and your dad\Nare pretty close, huh?
Hmm? Oh!\NNo. That's my mom!
\NShe's a kid! I mean, so young!
Don't we look alike?
\NYeah, like jailbait.
Every time I look at Dad
--I just can't help thinkin'.\N--What?
What part of my dad did\Nmy mom find so attractive
that she'd wanna marry him?
\NIt's crazy how much you
and your mom look alike, though.
Do you like the same\Ntype of guy as your mom?
What is your type, anyway?
What's my type?
I don't know. I don't\Nthink I have one.
--Oh. Come on! You can tell me.\N--Wait!
Mom said that her and Dad\Nwere childhood friends first.
I don't think my mom\Nwas very picky
about the guy she liked.
Maybe that's a little harsh.
I bet she picked him\N'cause she felt sorry for him.
Even with your parents,\Nyou're brutal.
You know, lookin'\Nat this picture of Mom's
--got me thinkin'.\N--Mm-hmm?
These days you've got\Ncharacters in manga and games,
like junior high kids,\Nwho seem really mature,
but the adults all act immature.
What's up with that?
\NYeah, so?
You waiting for me to whip out\Na snide remark or something?
It's too bad Yuki-chan\Ncouldn't come over tonight.
Yeah. She had\Nstuff to do, though.
I know! I'll text Yuki-chan.
That way\Nshe won't feel left out!
Maybe you shouldn't bug her.
Miyuki's probably\Nbusy doing something.
--\N--That was quick.
"Glad to hear you're\Nall having fun.
"Right now, I'm working\Nhard and doing my best
"to finish my homework\Nfor the weekend.
If you do it again,\NI'll make sure to..."
I totally forgot\Nwe had homework to do!
Don't just sit there, Kagami.\NDo something!
\NI didn't have any homework.
Can I go to sleep now?
No! Wait!
-Oh! Remember the shooting star?\N--Yeah?
Maybe if I made shorter wishes\NI can get them to come true.
I don't know about that.
What you doin' over there?
I'm trying to figure out\Nif there's a way
to say my wishes faster.
Stop running away\Nfrom reality.
Hurry up and finish it.
\NHey, Yuki-chan.
I didn't really understand\Nthis part today.
Can you show me how it's done?
\NSure, I'd be glad to.
Kona-chan comes from Konata.
Yuki-chan comes from Miyuki.
Hmm...
Hey, Tsukasa,\Nwhat kind of nickname
would you give Kagami?\NKaga-chan? Gami-chan?
Uh. Hmm.
Kyou-chan might be good.
Kyou is another\Nway to say Kagami.
Ah! That's a good call.
It's perfect 'cause it reflects
her tough-as-nails personality.
It could also work\Nwith this Kyou-chan.
But that's not what I meant when\NI said it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
I think it's best\Nwe don't mention this
to sis, you know?
How about it you gave\Nyourself a nickname.
What would it be?
Tsuka-chan? Kasa-chan?
Hmm. How 'bout Hii-chan?
It's hard to make a nickname\Nout of my first name.
That's perfect! 'Cause I can\Npicture you as the type
who'd run around shrieking,\N"Hihi!" all the time.
That's not exactly\Nwhat I meant either.
Right!\NFrom this day forward, Tsukasa,
--I'm calling you Hii-chan.\N--Huh?
What? What's wrong?
-What do you mean, "huh"?\N-
It's just that it's\Nkinda weird, you know?
Picking your own\Nnickname, and all.
--Then, how about that?\N--That?
Uh. I guess it doesn't matter.
Don't you want\Nrevenge, Sebastian?
--Shiraishi.\N--Hey, Kyou-chan! Kyou-chan!
What the heck are you saying?\NAre you calling me?
It's totally confusing,\Nso stop it.
Okay. Then what do you\Nwant me to call you?
Isn't Kagami good enough?
Well, don't you wanna\Nhave a nickname too?
You know, like\NKona-chan and Yuki-chan?
Hmm.
How 'bout Kagami-sama?
Uh.
Hey! Kagami-sama!
Ugh. Oh, no!\NShe's using it.
Yeah, what?
I was just callin' ya.
Sorry for the wait, Kagami-sama.
What's wrong, Kagami-sama?
\NI'm sorry. It's my fault.
Just please call me by my name.
\N"Lucky Star."
\N"Lucky Channel"!
Hi, Luckies!
Wow! Isn't this great?
Can you guys believe\Nthat Lucky Channel's
surging forward\Nwith its tenth episode!
I'm Akira Kogami,\Nyour navigator.
Hello! I'm her assistant,\NMinoru Shiraishi.
How 'bout we get\Ndown to business
by introducing\Nthe fourth character.
It's Kagami Hiiragi!
In the show,\Nshe's the one who plays
the rational character\Nand keeps things on track.
So, basically she's\Na tsundere type. Yeah.
Right, I got it. Tsundere.
Talk about a shallow character.
On the contrary.
Huh?
Let's not jump to conclusions
by categorizing Kagami-san\Nas a mere tsundere.
\NWhat is she then?
Before we get into that,\Nwe must ask ourselves,
do we truly grasp\Nthe concept of tsundere?
See, in this day\Nand age, it's a sad fact
that as the term tsundere
becomes a part\Nof the main-stream,
its true meaning gets\Nlost in the process.
First we must trace its origins.
The term tsundere dates\Nback to the year 2002,
where it was first\Nused on the Internet.
It meant "a hostile person\Nwho becomes affectionate."
In other words, it was\Nsupposed to describe
how a character's personality\Nchanged over time!
Yeah, whatever.
These days, however,\Ntsundere is used
to describe\Na character's dual nature.
For example, a girl\Nwho's cold on the outside
but loving on the\Ninside would fit
the current definition\Nof the term.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
I declare that this\Nis all a huge mistake!
We must give the people back
the true definition of tsundere!
Sound the warning bells!
Rise up and be counted,\Nyou illiterate masses!
Arise!
You were going pretty\Ngood there, Sebastian.
Who's that?
So if Kagami isn't\Na tsundere, what is she?
Who's Sebastian?
I don't get why\Nyou're making it harder
than it needs to be, you know?
But since you\Nbrought it up, chief,
you got another word we can use
besides tsundere that gets\Nthe same point across?
What? Oh! Ah. I'm\Nsure there's somethin'
out there that would work.
Maybe Cool-dere?\NNo, that's not it.
Deretsun?
You really are an idiot,\Ndid you know that?
Isn't tsundere good enough?
No, it isn't. That's\Nwhat I've been saying!
Oh! How 'bout\Nwe have our viewers
think of a new term that\Ncould replace tsundere?
Now, that's what\NI call a good idea.
Coward.\N
Listen up! This goes out to\Neveryone watching right now.
I want you to come up\Nwith a new term
that would describe\Na character like Kagami.
And together we'll rewrite
the common facts of\Nmodern-day speech.
We'll call it\NThe Great Tsundere Debate!
For more info, please\Ncheck out our radio show
or log on to our site.
We're counting on your ideas!
Uh. So, are we done now?
'Bout freakin' time.
Lots and lots and lots and lots.
Bye-ni.
--Bye-ni!\N--
Fast forward!
\NWow! I talked up a storm today.
That was the best show ever!
Uh. Akira-sama?
What's wrong?
\NHappy now?
\NOh, yeah! I mean...
I got a lot of lines today.
I think I did a good job!
\NSo, I'm gonna have dinner
with one of the producers\Nand the president
of the production company.
--Huh? Oh!\N--Yeah.
We're gonna be talking\Nabout your future with the show.
\NHold on a second. Wait!
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know if\Ntelling you is gonna help.
I mean, if I have to tell you,\Nyou already don't get it.
--Whoa!\N--You still got that
part time gig in\N, don't you?
\NYeah, like during the day, I do.
But it's not like I'm\Ngetting rich working there.
\NAnd the Korean barbecue?
Well, yeah,\NI work there too, but--
Wait! No!\NThat doesn't matter!
Just stop it! That's\Nall private stuff!
\NWell, here I go.
What do you think\Nabout this song, Tsukasa?
Maybe. What do\Nyou think, Yuki-chan?
\NYes, I know it.
Then, how 'bout\Nyou guys sing it next?
\NThanks for finding it.
\NYes, thank you.
\NAt last.
\NDid you guys decide on a song?
\NYeah!
\NHey! Wasn't this song popular
back when we were\Nin kindergarten?
\NNo idea.
Oh, I'm sorry.\NI don't know either.
\NI totally remember it.
Our sisters used\Nto sing it a lot.
\NIt's said that songs sung
by our parents or\Nolder siblings,
even though they're from\Na generation before us,
are the ones we\Nremember the most.
\NOh! She couldn't hit it.
I couldn't help it!\NIt's too high.
On the next episode\Nof "Lucky Star"!
Kagami here!\NSay you're out with a friend
and you're getting\Nsomething to eat.
And everything's going great
until they bring out the soup.
There's always a little bit\Nthat splashes up, right?
Well, doesn't it suck when\Na drop gets on your clothes?
And if it's curry sauce\Nit sucks even worse!
Doesn't it seem like\Nit always happens
when you're wearing\Nyour favorite outfit?
And then it's like,\Nyou're totally bummed
for the rest of\Nthe day, you know?
It's like when you buy\Na bento box
with soup at the store.
You make sure to walk home\Nall steady and careful,
keeping that bag level so\Nnothing spills out, right?
Yeah. But then you get\Nhome and you open the bag
and the soup spilled out\Nand everything's soaked,
and you're like,\N"I'm so not hungry anymore."
And you know how nice it is when\Nthey're bagging your stuff
and they bother to separate\Nthe cold things from the hot?
And then they screw it all up by\Nputting the magazines you bought
in the same damn bag as\Nall your cold drinks.
And then the paper soaks up\Nall the condensation!
And now, you've got these\Nwarped and soggy magazines.
And you're thinking,
"Why the hell did\Nthey separate anything
in the first place?"\NYou know?
Next episode,
"Various Ways\Nto Spend Christmas Eve."
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay! Let's do this!
\NSure! Let's go!
\NGrr!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
So the other day the three\Nof us saw a shooting star,
then Kagami said that the\Nwhole wishing on it thing
impossible 'cause you can't wish
fast enough for it to work.
How nice!\NShooting stars.
I rarely get to see them\Nbecause the location
of my house isn't\Nconducive to star gazing.
Oh yeah, that's right.
It's 'cause you live\Nin the city, isn't it?
I would be\Nso fascinated watching,
that I wouldn't be able\Nto make a wish.
You feel so happy\Nwhen you look up
and see all those beautiful\Nbrightly shining stars.
When you think about it,\Nperhaps that explains the legend
that shooting stars\Ngrant wishes.
Your purity shines\Nso brightly it's blinding me,
blinding me, I say!
Winter vacation's almost here.
But our finals\Ncome right before that.
Hey, Kagami, are you guys going\Nanywhere over the vacation?
Uh-uh.\NMmm, come to think of it,
we haven't\Ndone any traveling lately.
The other day,\NI took a trip to Asakusa.
Yeah?\NWhen did you go out there?
Well, don't you guys get sleepy
riding the train in winter?
\NShe missed her stop?
Um, wait, isn't that in\Nthe opposite direction?
I slept so long, the train\Ngot to the final stop,
doubled back and went\Npast my station again.
When I woke up I realized\NI was in Asakusa.
Oh, come on, there's\Ngot to be a limit
to how many times you\Ncan skip your station.
Missing your stop 'cause you\Noverslept isn't a bad thing.
I mean, I got to take\Na little vacation to Asakusa.
You shouldn't be taking\Nlittle vacations during exams.
For a minute there\NI thought I saw a girl
standing on\Nthe platform wearing
a sailor uniform\Nand carrying a machine gun.
I wonder what the heck\Nher problem was.
You're not gonna tell us\Nyou saw
someone\Nget whacked, are you?
Besides, they say that kids\Nwho sleep a lot grow more!
Yeah, right, shorty.
There's someone else\Nwho's worse!
After pulling\Nan all-nighter on a manuscript,
my dad took the morning\Ntrain to go deliver it.
He fell asleep\Nand missed his stop.
He slept all the way\Nto the last stop,
then the train turned around,\Nand before he knew it,
he slept his way back\Nand forth a bunch of times!
He'd start to wake up whenever\Nhe'd get close to his stop,
but the poor guy always fell\Nright back to sleep again.
All he wanted to do was\Ncome home and go to bed,
but he couldn't stay awake long\Nenough to get off the train.
Wow.
And whenever dad got\Njostled by the train,
he'd wake up\Nall startled, but then
he'd get all confused\N'cause he couldn't
figure out which direction\Nhe was heading in.
Yeah, right.
Even if I fall asleep\Non the train,
I always wake up\Nbefore I get to my stop.
That's amazing!
How do you know\Nwhen to wake up?
Maybe she's got\Nan internal alarm clock.
Although the one in her\Nstomach seems to be broken.
What was that?
It's the one that\Ngauges your candy intake.
Shut up!
You know how\Nwhen you get on the train
and the seats are all warm?
Don't you get sleepy?
I know, that's so true.
It's just like when\Nyou're sitting in class
and you're\Nby the window and it's
a sunny afternoon in winter.
It's warm, just like that!
It's like birds of a feather\Ncovering for each other.
No, it's\Nnothing like that, really!
I tried waking her up on\Nthe ride home the other day.
Hey, come on,\Nwake up, we're here.
Yeah, give me five minutes.
Just five more.
She said out loud in her sleep
and then everyone around us\Nstarted laughing.
That's so weird,\NI have a friend
who totally said the same\Nthing in class one day.
Oh brother, you guys are\Nbirds of a feather all right.
Ah, no we're not!
Why do we ask\Nfor five more minutes?
Maybe 'cause you'd get\Nupset if you tried waking
someone up and they said,\N"Hey, give me another hour."
I guess, but asking\Nfor five more minutes
is something that comes\Nup in other things too,
besides sleeping, like\Nhang on for five minutes.
Yeah, I guess.
Maybe we use it a lot\Nbecause it's not too long
or too short,\Nbut if you wait five minutes
for a train,\Nit feels like forever.
Yeah, you're right.
Well, maybe.
The thing is though,\Nwhenever someone says
just five more minutes,\Nit never ends up
being five more minutes,\Ndoes it now?
You know how they\Ntell you that you can't
use your cell phone\Nor put makeup on
while riding on the train?
Well, I think\Nit's way worse when you're
sitting there\Nand a total stranger's
all leaning up against you.
Yeah, sometimes\Nthey're so heavy
that even though\Nit took you a while
to get a seat\Nyou'd rather stand.
Or when\Nit's some old person with
a sticky face leaning on you.
Sometimes,\NI'm all, "Lean that way,"
but it doesn't work.
No matter how many times\Nthey adjust their posture,
they always end up\Nleaning against me again.
I know, I know,\Nisn't that weird?
This one time I was asleep,
there was a middle aged guy\Nsitting here
and there was an empty seat\Nsitting here.
I was trying\Nto lean toward the empty seat,
but I always\Nended up leaning on
the middle aged guy instead.
Maybe everyone's\Ngot a particular side
they like leaning on\Nor something.
Whenever I'm in a spot\Nwhere someone's leaning on me,
I'll tuck myself in really\Ntight just like this,
but then they start jabbing\Naway at me with their elbows.
You really think they're\Nasleep when they do that?
What?\NYou mean they're not?
See ya.
\NBye-ni!
Goodbye.
Oh wait, before you guys go,
you know how some folks\Nat school take the up train,
and then you got other students\Nwho take the down to get home?
Yeah.
Don't you think\Nthat all the people taking
the up train look\Nway more sophisticated
than the ones taking the down?
That sounds\Njust like Yuki-chan.
No, it's not like that.
All right, young ladies,\NI better
bust a move\Nback to shanty town.
Hm?
Wha...
Huh?
This isn't my stop,\Nit's the next one.
Hey guys, what's up?
Yo.
Ah, for some reason,
I couldn't study\Nat all last night.
Ooh, well, I on the other hand,\Nstudied my brains out
last night so I'm feeling\Npretty darn stoked right now.
Good for you.\NHow long did you study for?
-Only four hours.\N-A whole four hours!
\NWhat the...?
\NKagami, you do
everything perfect,\Nyou know that?
Not that I'm bragging\Nor anything,
but just between you and me,
I do a heck\Nof a lot of studying.
When it comes right down to it,
you're pretty competitive,\Naren't you, Kagami?
Well, I guess\Nit might be my pride
at being the older sister.
I always felt that pressure\Nand that's why I work hard,
to stay\Na step ahead of Tsukasa.
I know I always\Ntell her that being
older or younger\Ndoesn't really matter,
but I used\Nto think about it a lot.
But does it even matter\Nwith Tsukasa?
I mean,\Nwhere's the challenge?
Um, well, yeah,\NI guess there isn't any.
Damn you, Kona-chan!
Christmas is almost here.
I wonder what kind of present\NI'm gonna get this year.
You still get presents?
That's so awesome!
How old were you\Nwhen you found out
there really wasn't\Nany Santa Claus?
Huh, you mean there's\Nno such thing as Santa Claus?
For real?
Did you know Santa never\Ncame by Kona-chan's house?
Her dad tells her Santa gives\Nhim gifts to give to her.
That way she thinks\NSanta's really out there.
Her old man\Nreally wants to look good
in front of his daughter,\Ndoesn't he?
How's it going, Hiiragi?
Oh, hey.
Hiiragi-san, I have\Nyesterday's printout.
Oh, yeah, sure.
It's like that, Hiiragi-chan.
Wait, Hiiragi,\Nyou dropped your pencil.
Oh, thanks a lot.
Hiya, Kagami!
Oh, hey.
Kagami-san,\Nhere's yesterday's printout.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Sebastian's stinky, isn't he?
Hey, Kagami, you dropped\Nyour handkerchief.
For real?
Geez, I guess\NI hang out in Tsukasa's
class more than I thought.
You know my cavity's\Nbeen hurting a lot lately.
Oh, how can you stand it?
You know how\NI totally hate the dentist.
Oh yeah, you went to get\Na cavity fixed the other day.
Is it all better?
You know how dentists are.
Once you're\Nin their clutches,
they take a long time\Nto fix one tooth,
and then after\Nthey finish working on it,
they find another tooth that
desperately\Nneeds their attention.
So after making\Na number of excuses,
I got up and ran away\Nas fast as I could.
What's a girl to do?
She's all cute when she says\Nit but that's totally nuts!
Hey, Konata.
How about we all get together\Nand throw a Christmas party?
Oh, sorry, but I've already\Ngot plans for Christmas.
Really?\NDo these plans involve a guy?
Well, you could say that.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Are you and your dad\Ngoing out someplace?
Good try, but I did tell him
that I'd be coming home\Nlate that night.
No way, you're going out\Non a date with some guy?
When did you get a--
Sorry to burst\Nyour bubble, girls,
but I got\Na part-time job, remember?
Phew.
But I wasn't\Nreally lying, 'cause
most of the customers\Nare guys, right?
I thought you snuck\Nahead of us there.
Yeah, so did I.
Every year at Christmas\Nthe cafe puts on this event
where all of us\Nget dressed up like
Santa Claus for the customers.
You really do like that\Nkind of stuff, don't ya?
Hm, so do you.
Every New Year's Eve\Ndon't the two of you
go to your family's shrine\Nand cosplay as shrine maidens?
\NDo not call it cosplay.
Getting back to Santa,\Nit's awesome
that he gives out presents,
but that guy's\Ntotally breaking and entering.
I mean when I was a kid,\Nthat really freaked me out.
I wouldn't go around insulting
the legacy of a saint if\NI were you, you horrid child.
Whoa, hang on.
Huh?
Santa gives kids\Nwhat they wish for
and she's going\Nto dress up like Santa.
So what kind of men have wishes
that a Santa squirt\Nlike her can grant?
Oh, rolling out the\Ncasual insults, are we?
Come to think of it,\Nare you guys
even allowed\Nto celebrate Christmas?
Yeah, we've got\NChristmas presents
just like\Nall the other kids.
Back at our house,\Nwe were brought up
to respect\Nall kinds of deities.
Our family goes and visits\Ntemples all the time,
and we've even sung\Na hymn or two in a church.
Wow, you guys\Nare so well-rounded.
Yeah, but then our big sister\Nwho's a shrine maiden too,
she told me that\Nwhen she got married
it'd be in a wedding dress.
I wonder how Mom and Dad\Nare gonna feel about that.
Whoa, hang on.
Sounds like it's\Ngonna get complicated.
\NLucky Star.
Yoo-hoo!
Boy, it's getting cold\Nout there.
Hey there, Nee-san.
Come on in.
What you watching, huh?
Just one of\Nthose detective drama shows.
Oh, is it anything good?
No, not really.
There's nothing else on.
That's it,\NI got it. That guy did it!
One moment\Nplease, Detective.
Don't you think there's
something\Nstrange about this case?
\N'Course not, this solves it!
Who are you anyway?
This ain't your business.
Oh brother,\Nthat's a perfect example
of why the cops are such morons.
But aren't you\None of those cops?
Perfect timing, Mr. Telephone.
We're almost\Nat the part of the show
where the bad guy\Nconfesses everything.
How do you know that?
Look.
So, I guess you're\Nthe one who did it.
\NYeah, whatever, I give up.
Can somebody\Nplease tell me why the hell
every cop show has to end\Nat the top of a cliff?
Maybe it's 'cause\Npeople can't get themselves
to go through with anything
unless they've been pushed\Nto the edge of a cliff.
Yoo-hoo, hey, how's it going?
I'm hanging in there, Nee-san.
So, what\Nare you watching tonight?
It's the movie version of\Na popular detective show.
Dad rented it for us.
The case isn't here\Nin the boardroom,
it's out there\Nat the crime scene.
No, no, no, no,\Nthat's totally wrong.
Like police work ever\Ngets that passionate.
You sound pretty passionate.
If I remember this thing right,
the thief isn't the guy\Nwho stole the receipt,
it's some other guy who was\Nhired by the police chief.
Wanna know how you screwed up,\NChief? That's how.
You're talking\Nabout the show, right?
You know, people are\Nalways eating pork bowls
on cop shows, but I heard that\Ndoesn't happen in real life.
Of course not.
Everyone knows most of\Nthat stuff's made up.
You mean the Metro Police chief
doesn't really have that\Nmany granddaughters?
Ugh, the chief's\Ngot granddaughters?
That's the first\NI've heard of it.
If anything,\NI'd want Mai to be real.
That's all I'd wish for.
And what an empty wish it is.
Hmm, hmm, hmm...
I can't believe all the cases\Nof adults attacking children.
It's so horrible.
Wanna know\Nwhat I think about that?
Martial arts!
If you make every kid\Nlearn martial arts,
stuff like that won't\Nhappen as much, right?
Look at Oyama-sensei.
After years\Nof intense training--
hi-ya--\Nhe was able to beat down a cow
with one bare-handed slap!
And every day he works out\Nby giving
20 bears a pounding!
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's all good,\Nbut I don't think
it's very smart in the long run.
I mean,\Nwhen those kids grow up,
they're going to turn into\Nsome butt-kicking adults.
Oh, yeah.
But on the other hand,\Nthey say that
when someone\Npractices martial arts,
they grow up to be a more mature
and level-headed person.
Oh, they do huh?\NReally?
'Cause there's someone\Nright in front of me
who practices martial arts\Nand she's anything but mature.
That's not very nice.
Okay, you guys,\NI got a news flash.
Yui Nee-san has a little sister
who's gonna be starting\Nhigh school next year.
She's always been kind of frail,
but she's a really nice girl,
and she's super cute!
Cool.
But there's something\Nthat bothers me about her.
If you buy into that proverb,
a healthy spirit\Nleads to a healthy body,
I can't help\Nbut think there must be
something\Ndark and sinister hiding
behind her pretty little eyes.
I doubt that everything happens
the way the proverbs say.
You're living proof of that.
Can you believe\Nthis year's almost up?
Every time\NDecember comes around,
I feel like the year flew by.
This year,\Nare you guys gonna help
your folks by doing the\Nshrine maiden thing again?
Of course.
You should come\Nand pick your fortune.
Oh yeah, those.\NIf you pick
an unlucky scroll,\Nyou feel lousy about it
and then you get all depressed.
But if you pick a great\Nblessing scroll, doesn't it
feel like you totally wasted\Nyour good luck for the year?
That's why they say\Nthat middle blessings
are the best to get.
Alrighty, class, 'tis\Nthe season for presents,
and as your teacher,\NI got you some report cards!
How'd you do, Kona-chan?
Thank you, ma'am, but\NI don't want this present.
It's my policy as Santa\Nto hand out those presents
to show you how hard you\Nworked in class, so enjoy it!
Hope you like the homework\Nyou get over vacation, too.
I wonder\Nwhat kind of Christmas cakes
they're gonna have out\Nthis year?
When you go into\Na bakery around this time,
there's so many cakes.
Just looking at all of them\Nis so much fun, isn't it?
I wonder what happens\Nto all the leftover cakes
after Christmas ends.
Perhaps the bakery\Nlets the employees
take them home\Nto their families.
If nobody wants\Nto take 'em home,
then they'll throw out\Nthe extra cake.
That reminds me of how\Nthey compare Christmas
and the prime age\Nfor marriage.
Like it's over after 25?
Up until the 25th,\NChristmas cakes are the best,
but the day after Christmas,
you're looking at the\Nsame cake differently.
Suddenly all those\Ndecorated cakes don't seem
so yummy and you just don't\Nfeel like eating 'em anymore.
Me and Kona-chan were talking\Nabout Santa the other day.
So when did you stop\Nbelieving in Santa, Yuki-chan?
I bet you were like me\Nand believed in him
for a long time, didn't you?
It's true, I did believe\Nin Santa when I was younger.
In fact, I wanted to write\NSanta a thank you letter for
all the wonderful gifts, so\NI decided to do some research.
I tried asking\Nmy parents about him,
but that didn't lead anywhere.
So I did\Nsome more investigating.
And I came across\Nphrases like stories
that Santa Claus was based on\Nin the origin of Santa.
Needless to say, my dreams\Nwere shattered early on.
How'd you do, Miyuki-san?\NLet me see!
Whoa.
That's our Yuki-chan.
Wish I could\Nget grades like that.
Getting blown away like this is
really starting to piss me off.
Oh, come on, Yuki-chan's\Nalways at the top of our class.
We'll never get grades like her.
I'm not talking about grades,
I'm talking about breast size.
I mean,\Ndid you get a load of hers?
I'm getting hungry.
I guess I'll have\Na cup of ramen.
Not yet?
Oh, it feels like an eternity.
This is the longest\Nthree minutes ever.
I'll pass the time\Nby reading my manga.
And then your noodles end up all
soggy and everything, you know?
I know, it's\Nlike instant yakisoba
soaking up all the water!
Give me a break.
I knew she was gonna\Nbe late, but this is ridiculous.
I can't let this become a habit.
Here's where I need to be a dad
and stop this\Nbefore it gets out of hand.
\NI'm home!
Konata, get your butt in here!
Do you even care what time it--
Merry Christmas!
Here's a Christmas present\Nfrom me to you, Daddy.
I hope you like it.
I bet you're cold\Nfrom being out so late.
You want some tea, honey bunny?
Yeah, you know it!
I'm so happy,\NI think I could die now.
\NHi! What up?
Yui Nee-san's in the house!
\NYou totally reek.
You didn't drive, did you?
No, I parked the car\Nand hit the bar, man!
Can you believe this?\NIt's like Christmas Eve,
but my husband isn't even home.
It was gonna be\Nour special night.
Couldn't you go visit your folks
once in a while\Ninstead of coming here?
\NYui? Oh hey, it's me.
I was gonna\Nsurprise you tonight,
but yeah, the door's locked.\NAre you with your parents?
I'm coming home!
I'll be there in\Na flash, baby, turbo style!
I won't stop for any\Ntraffic lights either!
Don't go breaking any laws\Nin your condition there, tiger.
I can take her home.
I'm not ready for bed yet,\Nso I think I'll log on.
Hey, teacher's online.
Hey, ma'am,\Nlet's have ourselves a riot.
All night long, that okay?
Just a minute, please.
You are not a leftover.
You are\Nnot a leftover.
'Cause I bought you.
Yeah, I came down here\Nlast Sunday too.
I bought some manga.
The train fare down\Nmust really add up.
I know you do it for the points
and all, but that's hardcore.
You really love this.
And do you even use any of the
prizes you get from that stuff?\NSeriously.
Mm-mm, I don't use any of 'em.
Well, I guess\Nit would be kind of hard
to use that stuff after all\Nthe effort it took to get it.
You know it.\NIt'd be a waste to use it.
Using it makes it less valuable!\NDon't you know that?
Okay, if that's\Nhow you feel about it.
No!
Yes.
Didn't you get shocked\Nby the static?
Uh-uh.
Well, why didn't you?
She spends so much time\Nin front of the computer
she probably absorbed all\Nkinds of weird electric waves.
Static is the worst\Nthing about winter time.
You can get shocked\Njust by touching someone,
even if you barely touch 'em.
Maybe these\Nguys don't like each
other after all, for real.
Ah!
What the heck are you doing?
I just wanted\Nto try it again.
\NLucky Star.
\NLucky Channel!
Hiya, luckies!
I'm your navigator,\NAkira Kogami!
It's already\Nthe eleventh episode,
guys, can you believe it?
And since it's the 11th episode,
I can finally tell you the\Nfantastic gabalicious news that
-you've all been waiting for!\N-Yeah, um...
We've gotten lots of\Ncomments from passionate fans--
-She's ignoring me as usual.\N-Really want to see Akira-san
in the main segment of the show,
and there were\Nso many of you out there
wanting me\Nthat it couldn't be ignored!
Hi guys, I'm Minoru Shiraishi,\Nthe assistant to Aki--
Shut the hell up.
I'm going to make an\Nappearance in the show!
I want to thank\NMiss Konata Izumi from Saitama
who sent her postcard\Ninto Newtype,
oh, and everyone else,\Nthank you, thank you.
Wow, you got cast too,\NAkira-sama?
Huh?
Yeah, what's with the attitude?
Like, oh,\Nyou're finally getting a spot
in the show\Nin like episode 12,
but I was in the show\Nthis whole time, huh?
What's up with that?
No, that's not it!
I swear, I'm totally honored\Nthat I'll be acting
in the show with\Nyou, Akira-sama, believe me!
Hmph, acting\Nin the show, he says.
All you did today was\Npick up a handkerchief.
Oh, how you dream about\Nmaking it in the industry,
but you're totally\Nexpendable and you
could disappear like that!
Keep that in mind\Nand maybe you'll
stick around a bit longer!
Okay.\NI'll keep that in mind.
After an announcement like that,
I bet you can't wait\Nto see the next episode.
You want to see it now,\Nhuh, do ya, do ya?
Everyone's trembling, no, naked
and trembling,\Nwaiting to see it!
I know, let's air it right now!
We can't tease\Nthe fans like this!
Come on, you guys, let's\Ngive 'em what they want!
All we need's\Na 30-minute block to do it.
We can steal a 30 from\Nthe next show, right, guys?
Oh well, I guess that's it then.
I want to hear from you guys,\Nso call into
our radio show or log\Non to our website, okay?
Bye-ni!
\NBye-ni!
\NOh, what am I gonna do?
It won't be cool if\NI upstage the main characters.
I heard that,\NI've seen it happen before.
The main character's\Nfriend or the bad guy.
Basically, whoever isn't\Nthe main character,
they end up being more popular.
Uh, Akira-sama, what's wrong?
So, you're\Ntalking about yourself?
You're talking about you?
You got a big fat head now\N'cause you're the popular one?
\NNo, it's not like that!
They gonna make\Nan action figure out of you?
\NNo, no they're not!
What are you talking about?
I never said--\NHang on a second, please.
Stop it and hear me out!
Yay, looks\Nlike Miyuki-san and
Tsukasa's duet's coming up next.
Yuki-chan,\Nlet's go sing up front.
\NUh, sure.
Huh, I can't\Nbelieve you actually
picked a song that Tsukasa\Nand Miyuki both know.
Oh, I know\Na whole lot of songs.
All types, too.
\NThat's an anime song.
\NWhen you need to pick a song
in a hurry, anime song's\Nare the way to go.
On the next\Nepisode of "Lucky Star."
\NTsukasa here.
Okay, so a couple\Nof nights ago,
I got really,\Nreally hungry, but since
it was so late at night,\NI mean, like, really late,
I didn't know if I should eat\Nsomething or not, you know?
Anyway, I figured\Na little bite wouldn't hurt,
so I went to go get something.
Well, I went to the kitchen\Nand I opened the fridge,
and I was thinking\Nabout these pastries
I had that I saved and--
Oh, that's it?
Next time:
Let's Go to the Festival!
\NLook forward to it!
\NOkay, let's do this!
-Sure, let's go.\N-Grr!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
♪ Miyuki-san! ♪
Are you gonna be doing\Nanything fun on New Year's Eve?
Oh, why do you ask?
There's a super cool festival\Ngoing on.
Want to come with me?\NWhat do you say?
A festival for the new year?
That does sound\Nlike a lot of fun.
\NOh yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Oh, I wonder if it's anything\Nlike the Snow Festival.
Unfortunately, I'm going\Nto visit with my family.
-Ah, perfect timing.\N-
I couldn't help but overhear,
but didn't I get the same invite\Nfrom you last summer?
Did you, Kagami-san?
Here's a translation\Nof Konata's jibber-jabber.
She wants you\Nto run around and buy stuff
at that Comiket thing.
When I went this past\Nsummer, it blew my mind.
I wasn't lying, though.
I mean, a festival's\Na festival, right?
Besides, going alone is no fun.
It's a lot of work.
\NHello? Izumi residence.
Hey, what's up?
I was just doing\Nmy New Years cards,
and I wasn't sure if you\Nwere still in mourning.
I didn't get a decline note\Nfrom you yet.
Hm? We're not in mourning.
What made you think that?
\NWhat are you talking about?
You took a couple days\Noff from school this year
'cause you were\Nin mourning, weren't you?
Oh, that.
Yeah, I remember.
We're doing much better now.
I cannot believe you'd\Nuse such a cheap trick!
\NShiny, happy.
I'm kind of right in the middle
of our big\Nhouse cleaning now, so--
\NYeah, yeah, I got it.
I'd hate to keep you away
from all that dusting\Nyou got going on.
-But--\N-Later!
-Yeah.\N-
This sucks.
Ah! Why is it that whenever\Nyou got stuff to do
that you don't want to do\Nyou go into cleaning mode?
And why is it\Nthat when you do start cleaning,
you realize that you'd rather\Nbe doing something else?
Hey, Konata, less breaks,\Nmore cleaning, okay?
Why is it called Comiket, huh?
I know\Nit's a big festival and all,
but don't you think it starts\Ntoo early in the morning?
I can't wait to see it!
You have no idea what\Nyou're getting into, do you?
I pity you.
Ah, she'll get used to it\Nin no time.
Tsukasa, I gotta warn you\Nthat this thing's
gonna wear you out,\Nlike in all kinds of ways.
You okay with that?
Mm. Mm-hmm!\NDon't worry, I'm good.
Something tells me you\Ndon't really understand.
Unbelievable.
The train's\Nbeing overrun by otaku.
Be patient! The light\Nwill turn green momentarily.
Hey, sis,\NI'm getting really scared.
I hate to say I told you so.
Okay, here's the part\Nwhere I give
the two of you\Nyour assignments for today.
Assignments?
Assignments, here are\Nyour shopping lists.
When we get in there,\Nwe're gonna split up.
Then we're gonna hit\Nall the tables
in the order shown on this map.
You guys take sections one\Nto three in the east hall,
I'll take four to six.
But, you have to be careful.
I've indicated your route\Nin red ink on the map.
If you don't stick to the route,
you're going to get\Ncaught between the lines
for the tables\Nthat are along the walls,
like right here and here.
If the two of you get stuck\Nin the crowds in this area,
you're going to lose\Nat least 30 minutes.
I dunno,\Nthis looks sketchy to me.
Can't we just hang out?
Oh, come on, you'll be fine.
Look, the tables marked in green
are the ones you can\Nleave until the afternoon.
These guys won't sell\Nout of stuff that quick
'cause they usually have\Na lot of stock on hand, okay?
Concentrate on getting\Nto all the tables
marked in red\Nbefore the morning's over.
"S" is for new, "K" is for\Npreviously published.
If you're not sure, just buy\None of everything they have.
Doesn't matter\Nif it's new or not.
-Here's your ammo, men.\N-Huh?
It's cash,\N'cause you don't want
to be fiddling with your\Nwallets during checkout.
The cafe au lait is to\Nkeep your sugar level up.
Take a drink every 30 minutes.
-This is our rally point.\N-Huh?
Meet me here\Nat exactly 1300 hours.
-\N-
I'll wait for you\Nfor 15 minutes.
If you don't show,\Nthen I'll know
to go look for you in first aid.
That's it. Any questions?
I got a question.
How come your passion\Nand intellect
only pop out when you're\Nbeing a total fangirl?
-\N-Please, don't run!
Climax from the get go!
The new issue is limited\Nto four per person.
That's four copies per person!
Behave yourselves!
Um, excuse me.
Hi, I was wondering\Nif this was A92?
Indeed it is.
Hi, you're getting one each\Nof the new issues?
1,000 yen please.
You were saying?
Oh right, sorry.
I was looking\Nfor your new issues.
Perfect, the new issues\Nare this one
and that one,\Nand they're both 500 yen.
Ah, thanks for the help today.
You like the cookies I made?
You loved them, didn't you?
Oh, that's awesome.
Can I have three copies of each?
Absolutely!
"Slippery Brigade Leader"\Nand "The Naughty Captain."
-Enjoy! 3,000 yen please.\N-Ah!
I'll take all of these, please.
Sure, that'll be\N4,500 yen, please.
Here you go.
Thanks for you business,\Nhope you like 'em.
Tango down, proceeding\Nto the next target.
I wonder\Nif I'm in the east hall now.
If I am, that means north\Nis that way so then-- oh boy.
Ah! No, no, wait a minute!\NPlease! Oh no!
Um, excuse me, but I\Nneed to go that way! Ah!
All right,\NI guess I've covered
pretty much all the big ones.
Let's see,\Nwhere should I go to next?
Huh?
Oh.
\NA little peek won't hurt.
Wah!
Gauron's really sticking it\Nto Sousuke.
No way!
You like it?
You can take it home\Nfor 500 yen.
Um, ah... it's too stimulating.
Huh?
No way, it's her!
The legendary girl "A."
\NRelax!
She'll think something's up\Nif you start freaking out.
Right. You're right, I know.
But I heard that whenever\Nshe comes here
and buys stuff,\Nwhoever she buys from,
their books\Nsuddenly get popular!
How could I not\Nbe excited about her?
Dude, I know!
I want her to buy one\Nas bad as you do!
We worked our butts off\Non this issue.
Yeah, we did, didn't we?
We took time off\Nof work and everything
just to make this issue\Nrock like a mother.
This is our year.
-Can you feel it?\N-Can I check it out?
Yeah, sure!
Hm.
What do you think? How is it?
It's pretty cool, isn't it?
We put a lot of work into\Nthe scene with the live show.
Hm, needs work.
-\N-Thanks anyway, guys.
Don't cry,\Nthere's always next summer.
'Scuse me, can you help me?
Sure, what can I do for you?
I'm kinda lost and\NI'm looking for Pu-61.
Which way is it?
Oh, I think you'll find the\NPu section in the east hall.
How do I get to the east hall?
This is the west hall.
You need to get in that line\Nover there, and head upstairs.
That'll take you right\Nover to the east hall.
How long do you think it'll\Ntake for me to get there?
Hm, right now?
I think it'll take\Nabout an hour.
Okay, that's all.
I'm sorry, Kona-chan.
I got lost\Nand then I had to escape
from this place\Ncalled the west hall.
I wasn't paying attention\Nand I got
washed away by the crowd.
What kind of place is this?
I had to stand in line\Nfor the bathroom
and it took an hour.
I figured the little\Nshopping list I gave you
was gonna be too much\Nfor a first timer.
It's all good.\NLet's take it easy
and look around\Nfor the rest of the day.
\NShe hasn't had enough?
I have to say though,\Nsince they moved
the festival to Ariake,\Nit's gotten better.
You should've seen it before.
Back in the day when it\Nwas held in Harumi Hall
there were only two\Nconvenience stores in the area.
Oh, back in the day, huh?
Mm-hmm, I think\Nthe last time they held it
in Harumi Hall\Nwas like 12 years ago?
-Huh?\N-Whoa! Hold on a sec.
-How old were you?\N-Hm?
I was about five.
It was great, my dad always\Nused to take me there.
We'd spend a couple nights
in this place\Ncalled the Hotel Urashima.
The first time he took me\Nwas a Summer Comiket.
The second floor of the new\Nhall was totally awesome!
The sweat from all the\Npeople in there evaporated
-and rose to the ceiling.\N-
Then it turned into this\Nhuge cloud of steam!
-\N-Yeah, too much information.
Ever since they started\Nhaving this thing in Ariake,
it's gotten better and better.
But because it's gotten so\Nbig, all the younger people
who come here act like this\Nis some kind of supermarket.
That breaks my heart 'cause they\Ntotally miss the point of it!
This event was supposed\Nto be something
the fans all did together.
Sorry to interrupt\Nyour nostalgia,
but I don't get\Nany of it, at all.
Huh?
I didn't see this last summer.
Do they always have\Nsomething like this?
Mm-hmm, although by now
most of the good stuff's\Nall sold out.
Hm.
-Look, you guys, it's Nagato!\N-Huh?
It's the real Nagamon,\Nand she's selling stuff!
Who?\NWhat are you talking about?
What do you mean you sold out\Nof Haruhi stuff?
You're pissing me off, kid!
Give me my Nagato phone card!
Geez. What an ass.
As I was saying before,\Nthere's a lot more
of that type coming here\Nthese days.
I'm sorry to have to\Nbe the one to tell you
but the limited edition\Nitems we had for sale
have completely sold out!
What?\NYou gotta be kidding me!
\NI am not kidding.
That's what happens\Nwhen you get here late.
-Who's that?\N-Sorry, kid, but you have
to line up in the morning\Nif you want to get--
You idiot!
Asia.
\NHey, what the hell?
You will do your best\Nto make the customers happy,
even if they show up late.
You're showing\Na complete lack of spirit!
But-- but we sold out\Nof the limited-edition things.
We've only got leftovers\Nand old stock!
Did you just say leftovers?
There's no such thing\Nas leftovers!
Don't let the flashy trends\Nand cheap moe urges fool you!
Comiket is here\Nto show you the true value
of your so-called leftovers!
And now,\Nafter all the limited edition
thingies have been sold,
the real battle between\Ncorporate booths
is about to begin!
I-- I didn't know.
Well, don't you have a\Nsuggestion for this customer?
The best you have, sir,\Nand be quick about it!
Something.\NIsn't there a weapon?
Well, how about\Nsomething like this?
No, this is more like it!
You see?\NNagato sold out.
Everyone sold out,\Nbut do you see this?
Even Koizumi sold out.
Silence,\Nhow do you think I feel?
This is three years old.
The Captain card\Nsold out the first day.
Well, kid,\Nyou want to buy a Kyun card?
No, Sousuke's the one for you!
I was looking\Nfor the Coco Saikube card.
You idiots!
It's the company president...
Mr. Takahashi!
Right, I am the company\Npresident, Mr. Takahashi.
And I overheard what you\Ntwo were telling this kid.
That booth's always got\Nsomething crazy going on.
\NR-really?
\N...unsuspecting customers,
well, I can't allow that.
But, sir, both of them\Nare main characters.
\NLucky Star!
\NI'm so tired.
\NI know, I'm tired too.
I wish we didn't have to come\Nhere right after Comiket.
How can they have\Nan event like that
right on New Year's Eve?
Kagami, Tsukasa,\NHappy New Year!
-Hey.\N-Hi, Kona-chan.
Happy New Year to you, too.
I can't believe\Nyou're still standing
after a crazy day like today.
Besides, it's so cold I\Nfigured you'd stay home.
Yeah, well,\Nyou got a point there.
But it's a new year and you\Nhave to start it off right!
The idea's to visit the\Nshrine and get yourself
charged up\Nfor the coming year.
Wow, that's admirable.
-I know, my dad said it.\N-Hello.
Suddenly,\NI'm feeling weird about it.
And your outfit's looking hot!
Oh yeah.
Stuff like this,\Nstuff like that.
Okay, I'm all done praying.
Oh, well great, good for you.
Have you guys finished\Nwith all your prayers
and stuff for the night?
Hey, sis, what were you
so feverishly praying for\Na little while ago?
What? You don't have to\Nbroadcast it to everyone.
And I wasn't\Nthat feverish about it.
I-- I was just thinking\Nhow nice it would be
if I could be in the same class
as you and Miyuki,\Nthat's all it was.
Hm?
Don't forget\NKona-chan's there too.
That's so adorable!
I never knew\Nyou had a cute side, Kagami.
Shut up, you!\NI didn't say anything
'cause I knew\Nyou'd tease me about it!
And the way you resist\Nyour cuteness is also cute!
-What about it?\N-You've always been
in a different class\Nthan the rest of us.
Maybe it's because Ms. Kuroi\Ndoesn't like me or something.
I know!\NI'm gonna go say a prayer
so that the two of us can be\Nin the same class together.
Really, Tsukasa?
I wouldn't do that\Nif I were you.
Kagami needs to be\Nin a different class.
-Huh, but why?\N-Elementary!
We need you there\Nso we can borrow your stuff
and copy your homework\Nwithout getting caught!
Besides, if you're\Nin the same class as me,
my ranking's gonna drop.
Maybe you should be\Nin a different class, weirdo.
-Yeah right.\N-Anyway, we saw Sebas--
Schoolgirls are\Nthe best! The best!
Will you and your dad be\Nbuying fortunes this year?
Yeah, you know it.\NThat's why we're here.
Oh!
Your new year is looking\Ngood right from the get-go.
I'll say.\NEverywhere I look it's good.
This is gonna be\Na great year, I know it.
-Oh, it'll be all right.\N-
Even though the fortune\Nyou picked is horrible,
it can only get better,\Nyou know?
Good things will happen.
Sure, yeah,\Nwhatever you say.
I guess it's\Nhow you look at it.
Thanks a lot!
If you're worried about it,
you could tie it to a branch\Nto lift the curse.
Hm, yeah, I'll do that.
Whoa! You gotta be kidding!
Whoa! More of 'em!
Ah, I found a spot!
I guess this is what\Nthey call being cursed.
Yeah.
Look, whether good things\Nhappen or not,
it all depends\Non you in the end.
A fortune is nothing\Nmore than a game of luck.
Yeah, I guess,\Nbut you're a shrine maiden.
I didn't know you could\Nsay something like that.
I know, I can collect\Nall the fortunes,
from great curses\Nto great blessings.
Those things\Nare not trading cards.
Maybe I could even find\Na secret fortune, too.
Oh, come on,\Nsecret fortunes?
What the heck\Nis a secret fortune?
Maybe an ultra great curse!
It's a curse. Who'd want to\Ncollect something like that?
I beg to differ.
You want to collect 'em all,\N'cause if you do,
you get a limited edition prize.
There is nothing like that.
I've been wanting to ask you\Nsomething ever since
I saw that huge Kagami-mochi.
That really big one?
I was wondering if that's where\Nthe name Kagami came from?
Well, yeah, I guess\Nyou can say it does.
Kagami-mochi is round,
the same shape\Nas an old-fashioned mirror.
And for a long time now,\Npeople have believed
that mirrors were\Nwhere the gods lived.
See, that's why\Nmy parents named me Kagami,
because they\Nhoped that my life
would be blessed\Nby the gods.
By the way, its shape symbolizes\Na well-rounded family, too.
Her name's got\Nall these mystical origins,
so can someone\Nplease tell me how
she grew up to be\Nsuch a hardcore realist?
Hmm.
-Ah!\N-You want one?
-Mmm.\N-They're nice!
There sure\Nare a lot of worshipers.
Yeah, well,\Nit is New Year's Eve.
This is nothing compared\Nto other shrines.
I bet most of 'em are here\Nfor the same reason as Dad.
They just want to check\Nout all the shrine maidens.
\NOh, come on!
There aren't\Nthat many pervs here.
I guess.
I guess it's that time again.
It's the first day\Nof the new year
and time\Nto start things off right.
Have a Happy New Year, Dad.
I hope you have\Nthe best year ever.
Happy New Year, hon.
\NYeah, Happy New Year!
How's it going, everybody?
I'm Du! How about this\Nbeautiful location, huh?
Isn't it great?
It's fantastic!
Ooh, look at\Nthat pretty flower!
-There's so many flowers.\N-
I made some tea, Dad.\NDo you want some?
Sure, I'll have a cup.
-Here you go.\N-Oh, thanks a lot, kiddo.
Dad, do you want to\Nplay this game with me?
Dad, do you want\Na bowl of rice cake soup?
Hey, Dad, how about--
Yeah, well, I guess\NDad thought it was cute,
the way I was bugging him.\NCan you believe that?
I got my New Year's\Nallowance, though.
He sure wore me out.
Ah, yeah, I bet.
You guys are totally weird\Nfor each other, aren't you?
And now that\Nmy New Year's allowance
has been secured,\NI think I'm gonna
head over to Gamers\Nright now and spend it.
\NRight.
Oh, it's a pain\Nstores like that
aren't open out here\Nin the sticks.
I mean, I'm a little strapped\Nfor cash these days.
And the train ride isn't cheap.
I wish there was a store\Nlike that around here.
Don't most stores have websites\Nyou can order stuff from?
Ever think of doing that?
I mean these days you can pretty\Nmuch order anything online.
You just don't get it, do you?
Yeah, shopping online's okay
'cause you can get\Npoints and stuff,
but looking around's the best\Npart of going into the store.
There's always a chance you'll\Nfind something unexpected that--
What is wrong with you?
All you want to do\Nis spend your money!
Daikon radish\Ngets all nice and done.
I wonder why people call\Nthese things "Pochi Bukuro."
I know. "Pochitto" means\N"a tiny amount,"
and "koreppocchi"\Nmeans "a bit."
It's a bag you put\Nyour loose change in.
Oh.
Western Japan\Ncalls it "pochitto,"
and "koreppocchi" is how\Nyou say it in eastern Japan.
Best wishes for a safe\Nand happy New Year.
Miyuki speaking.
Hi, Miyuki-san, happy\NNew Year to you, too.
So anyway,\NI want to know about these
Pochi Bukuro things, like\Nwhy they're called that.
Ah, come on.
Why can't you trust your\Nold man just a little bit?
Or at least you could do
your fact-checking\Nwhen I'm not around.
Alrighty then.
Time for me to log on and give\Nall my gaming buddies
a Happy New Year greeting.
Oh, teach logged on.
Oh.
This is so sad.
It's like the poor woman doesn't\Nhave anything better to do.
I mean,\Nshe's always online, always!
No wonder\Nshe doesn't have a boyfriend.
\NLucky Star!
\NLucky Channel!
Hiya, luckies!
I'm Akira-sama's assistant,\NMinoru Shiraishi.
Can you guys say,\N"time flies"?
'Cause we're\Non episode 12, baby!
-\N-Uh...
\NThis ocean is hell.
Okay, so, uh,
Akira-sama was\Nsupposed to show up
in today's episode\Nof "Lucky Star,"
but as you can see,\Nshe fell ill
at the last minute and\Ncouldn't quite make it.
-\N-Huh?
That's right,\Nit's a nasty cold.
But we had a standy of you\Nthere with a sign on it,
so if folks were\Nwatching the show,
they'd see something that sort\Nof looked like you.
-\N-Huh?
Wait, Akira-sama.
-\N-
Okay, I guess everyone can tell
Akira-sama's\Nwiped out for today.
So how about we wrap this up?
See you guys later! Bye-ni!
Huh, why do you keep\Nsaying that?
I am not getting a big head!
-\N-What?
"I'm gonna make you listen\Nto the full version
of 'Take It!\NThe Sailor Suit'"?
-\N-"Look forward"-- what?
"If you don't watch\Nthe next episode,
I'm going to lecture you\Nin the name of Mars."
\NFumoffu.
\NWay to tear it up, you guys!
\NThat was so much fun!
\NIt was!
\NNo one entered a song.
What's with you?\NYou're next in the lineup.
Why didn't you pick a song yet?
\NOh, I couldn't decide.
What song should I pick?
\NI'll help you look for one.
\NOh, I found a menu.
Ooh, I didn't know\Nthey served food here.
Mm-hmm.\NI sang this one already.
Now my flow's off.
Oh, I should've\Nsaved it for later.
\NWhat do you mean, "flow"?
You know, getting\Nyour groove on, your flow?
How you work yourself up\Nto sing a song?
\NI don't get it.
\NOoh, how about this one?
♪ Hey, Godman ♪
♪ Can you hear me? ♪
Look, they\Nalso have tambourines.
Yeah, so you can\Nreally have some fun.
Here, Miyuki-chan,\Nlet's use these.
\NHow fun!
\NYes, I'll do this one.
I don't care!\NJust pick something already!
\NHere's a song I know
will get everybody moving!
\NOh! You know this one!
\NI know it too!
\NWell, I know of it.
\N♪ Makenai... ♪
Oh, I blew it.
-\N-
On the next\Nepisode of "Lucky Star"...
\NMiyuki here. If you'd like
to describe something as\Nbeing at the top of its class
or standing head and shoulders\Nabove everything else,
you'd use the term "dan-totsu."
Apparently ,this is the\Nabbreviation of "danzen top."
According to record,\Nthe very first time this term
was used in print was when\Nyou-know-who won the election
to become governor of Tokyo.
And, yes,\Nhe did win by a landslide.
Next time, "Delicious Day."
\NLook forward to it.
\NOkay, let's do this!
\NSure, let's go.
\NGrrr!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
'Kay, time to take\Nyour seats, guys.
Happy New Year, everyone.
\NHere's hopin' you guys all have
a safe and productive\NNew Year.
But then again, some of you\Nwill be my responsibility
for only three more months.
I wonder who that could be.
Uh, ma'am, you don't mean me.
I can stay, right?
I believe in that it\Nfeels like a New Year thing.
There's definitely something\Nin the air.
Yeah, but then\Nschool starts up
and you get\Ninto a weird mood.
It kinda sucks.
There's a weird sorta\Nsomething working its power
over the holiday.\NYou got that right.
'Cause even though I spend my\Nfirst three days of the year
working my butt off\Nfor my family,
I gained weight!
That's the magic\Nof the New Year.
You know, it's\Nharder to burn calories
when it's cold out.
It's not like\NI was sitting around.
I mean, I was busy doing\Nall my Shrine Maiden stuff.
Bet you were busy eating, too.
Shrine Maiden New Year's food!
Shrine Maiden zoni soup!
Shrine Maiden snacks,\Nsnacks, snacks!
Shrine Maiden and snacks!
-Argh!\N-Yeah!
But then, there's the games\Nyou're supposed to play
over New Year's.
You know, stuff like\Nbattledore, Hyakunin Isshu,
and kite flying.
But I never saw anybody play\Nthat stuff over the holiday.
Well nowadays with all\Nthe power lines and traffic,
flying kites can be\Npretty dangerous.
I was pretty busy for the first\Nthree days of the New Year,
but after that, I just\Nread books and watched TV.
Actually, that's what\NI did over the break.
I played battledore, Hyakunin\NIsshu and Fortune's Smile.
Wow, I didn't think\Nyou'd be into that.
My family tends to be\NWestern in their ways,
but our country relatives\Nare much more traditional.
I wore my kimono to\Nthe shrine on New Year's Eve,
and I had a lot of fun\Nplaying games with my cousins.
"Even when the gods\Nheld sway in the..."
\NShe's way more Japanese than me.
\NShe's more traditional that us!
\NWhat is Fortune's Smile?
Hey, are all of the\N100 poems in Hyakunin Isshu
waka poems?
Yes, the first verse is read
and then you have to find the\Ncard with the second verse.
\NI bet you're awesome at it.
Oh, no, I'm not as good\Nas some players.
The really good ones can\Ngrab the correct card
in a blink of an eye.
Yeah, well, with me,
I sorta prefer playing\Nthe kinds of games
that don't make you feel\Nlike you're really studying.
You know, your attitude is the\Nreason why the future of Japan
is in the toilet.
I know!
We could have battles with\Nthe Hyakunin Isshu cards!
You could summon the power\Nof the monk Semimaru!
Semimaru's Shining Bright Attack
versus Ono-no-komachi's\NLovely Attack!
Now that sounds like fun.
Going there again, huh?
If you play the game\Nlike that, Kagami,
one that made you move around,
you'd be able to\Nlose some weight.
Shut up, you!
It's those damn rice cakes.
It's true, rice cakes\Nare high in calories.
If you have a piece\Nthe size of a matchbox,
it's basically the same calories\Nas a small bowl of rice.
That means each bite you take
is like a super\Nhuge bowl of rice!
Hold it!
Don't you eat rice cakes?
Yeah, you know,\NI grew up without a mom,
so I never really had stuff\Nlike zoni soup to eat.
I don't really eat rice\Ncakes all that much anyway.
Wow, you don't know\Nwhat you're missing!
There a lots of ways\Nto eat rice cakes.
Zoni soup, shiruko soup,\Nsoy-flavored mochi.
And it sounds like\Nthose rice cakes are gonna
screw up your diet\Nagain next year, Kagami.
Ugh!
I hope you don't mind\Nme asking, Izumi-san,
but instead of rice cakes,
what does your family\Neat for New Year's?
We eat stuff like\Npizza and pasta.
Oh.
Our family's New Year always\Nbegins with fresh pasta!
At the end of every year,\Nmy dad goes
and cleans out\Nthe pasta machine.
I bet you guys didn't know
that if you don't use it for\Na while, it gets all rusty.
And if you use it without\Ncleaning it first,
your pasta comes out\Nall black and stuff.
So me and Dad clean it up and\Nthen we make some fresh pasta
and bake up some\Nhandmade pizza dough.
\NOoh, that does sound authentic.
\NUnlike Kagami's house,
where the pizza's delivered and\Nthe pasta's the dried stuff.
\NUgh!
Yeah, actually, we don't eat\Npizza or pasta for New Year's.
No way!
\NIt doesn't work
with a traditional meal.
\NIt does work.
It goes great\Nwith roasted chicken!
\NIs that traditional?
\NYeah, it's traditional.
\NI think that's more Westernized.
\NNo way, really?
So, Miyuki-san, what food\Ndid you and your family eat
for New Year's?
You wanna know what we ate?
You're a rich girl,
and your family's more\Ninto Western customs.
I can't see you eatin'\Nrice cakes and traditional
New Year's food.
I bet you ate a full\Ncourse of French cuisine
on New Year's Day.
Oh, well that's\Nnot exactly true.
I did eat traditional\NJapanese food on New Year's.
In fact, when I took\Na bite of rice cake,
I couldn't bite through\Nand it stretched way out!
\NShe's a walking Shrine de Moe!
\NRice cakes are stretchy.
I can't believe how fast the\NNew Year's vacation goes by.
\NI know, Winter vacation
ends too fast.
Sure, it looks long on paper,
but after doing\Nthe big house cleaning,
writing all those New Year's\Ncards, and doing homework,
it doesn't leave you with\Na whole lot of relaxing time.
Whoa! I didn't get\Na New Year's card from you
and you copied\Nmy homework yesterday!
Uguu...
Did you have your first\Ndream of the year, Kona-chan?
Huh, oh, right.
You're supposed to have\Ngood luck if you dream
of certain things.
\NMmm-hmm, yup.
Yeah, usually they say it's\None, Mt. Fuji; two, hawk;
and three, eggplant.
I heard that they've\Nextended the items on that list
to four, a fan; five, tobacco;\Nand six, a blind musician.
\NWow, the list
goes up to six now!
Yeah, you know,
does anybody really\Ndream about that stuff?
I mean tobacco, eggplant,\Na blind musician?
Tell me about it.
Do you have to see all\Nthose things in the same dream
or something?
I suppose if you saw\Nthem all in one dream
you'd have tremendous\Ngood fortune.
However, you only\Nneed to see one.
Oh, I thought you\Nneeded to see something
like two hawks or three\Neggplants in a dream.
Hate to be the one to say this,
but I don't remember\Nmost of my dreams.
I think people who obsess\Nover stuff like that
are having way too much fun with\Nthe whole New Year's thing.
\NThat's true.
In my first dream of the year,
when I opened my shoe locker,\Nmy shoes were missing!
Imagine, but someone\Nelse's shoes were there,
and since I needed to go\Nhome, I tried to put them on.
Unfortunately, the shoes\Nwere the wrong size.
Hmm.
Later, I looked up\Nthe meaning of my dream
in the dictionary of\Ndreams and fortune telling.
A dream\Nis a subliminal message,
and according to the dictionary,\NI'm seeking social skills.
And it will be a long time\Nbefore I can attain them.
Apparently, whenever\Nyou see shoes in dreams,
it's supposed to mean\Nsocial status.
Shoes are social?
Uh-huh.
So you're ambitious,\NMiyuki-san.
I kinda get it,\Nbut sorta don't.
Heh-heh.
Did you guys hear what happened
at this year's\NComing of Age Ceremony?
A bunch of people\Nrushed the stage
and started causing trouble.
Don't they have any shame?
I mean, they're supposed\Nto be representing Japan.
Why bother going if you're\Njust gonna get kicked off?
That's what I'm saying.
The Coming of Age Ceremony's\Nso boring.
I don't wanna go, do you?
\NShe's on her way to becoming
a good-for-nothing adult.
So what are you guys gonna wear
to the Coming of Age Ceremony?
Hmm, since it's a\Nonce-in-a-lifetime thing,
I'd wear a long sleeve kimono.
Now that you brought\Nit up, what about you?
Yeah, well, knowin' my dad,
he's gonna want me to\Nwear a long sleeve kimono.
He totally would, wouldn't he?
Although, if you wore one,\Nyou'd look like a kid
celebrating your\Nseven-five-three!
Guh.
Happy New Year, and\Nhope it's a good one!
Happy New Year\Nto you too, Onee-san.
You haven't come by in a while.
Well, with my hubby coming home,
and all the New Year's\Nstuff that needed doing,
and my little sis caught\Na fever too, so...
Yeah, she's frail, isn't she?
I mean, that's not an excuse!
I wasn't trying to\Nweasel my way out
of giving you all you New\NYear's cash or anything, really!
\NI didn't even ask,
and she blows her cover.
Rookie move, officer.
\NIn other sports news today,
there was\Na Hyakunin Isshu tournament,
and it was\Nan awesome turnout.
\NOh, that reminds me!
When you were a little kid,
do you remember\Nwhat kind of stuff
you did on New Year's Day?
Hmm? On New Year's?
Let's see, I'm pretty sure\NI did something, I think.
Yeah, like, um...
\NDot, dot, dot, dot.
Sorry, brain fart!
I totally forgot.
\NMan, she lives in
her own little world.
I don't think I'll ever have a\Nnormal conversation with her.
I blasted all the memories\Nbehind me!
\NLucky Star!
You know,\NTsukasa's been holed up
under the kotatsu lately.
It's been cold though.
\NI know.
\NThe kotatsu's awesome,
but when you're under it,
getting up to go to\Nthe bathroom's a drag.
\NYeah, right?
But you don't have to say it\Nout loud like that.
\NMy dad's got
a killer line he whips out
whenever I've been sittin'\Nunder it for too long.
\NReally, what does he say?
Hey, Konata,\Nif you're gonna live
under that kotatsu all day\Nlong, I'm puttin' it away.
Ugh!
\NSo he doesn't mind
not having it out?
\NNo, he loves it!
He just wants to\Nteach me a lesson is all.
If we've been sittin'\Nunder it for a while
we both fall asleep.
\NOh, I know!
But I heard that if you\Nfall asleep like that,
you'll catch a cold.
\NYep.
If I catch us sleeping,\NI always try to turn it off.
Yeah, those kotatsus are like\Na mixture of heaven and hell.
\NUh, how?
\NBecause right before it goes on,
and after you've turned it off,
it feels even colder than ever.
Mm-hmm, you're right,\Nit does, doesn't it?
Isn't it hard to get out\Nof bed when it's this cold?
\NYeah, oh,
and when you take a bath
and that time it takes\Nyou to get undressed
and jump in the tub's awful!
Makes you think twice\Nabout runnin' bare naked.
\NYeah, 'cause it's slippery.
Oh, and when it's late and you\Nneed to go to the bathroom,
don't you hate that?
\NYeah, brr!
Come on, guys.\NWe gotta get off.
When you get off the bus
till you get into class\Nis hell, too.
Yeah.
It's almost Valentine's Day.
It gets more exciting around\Nthis time of year, doesn't it?
It's funny how\Neveryone walks around
acting like Valentine's\Nis no big deal,
but secretly, they're\Nall anxious about it.
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to have someone\Nspecial on that day?
Someone to share\Nyour feelings with?
I think that would be\Nthe best thing ever.
Ah, Tsukasa, you're\Na hopeless romantic,
and I won't say\Nit's a conspiracy
invented by the candy industry.
Now that you mention it,
this time of year's special\Nfor someone like me, too.
Why?
'Cause the leftover chocolates\Nalways go on sale afterwards
so I can buy a lot for\Ncheap to make my own.
You really have no\Ndreams at all, do you now?
They say,\N"Money can't buy you love,"
but when you think about it,\NValentine's Day chocolates
are a way to show your love\Nand you buy it with money.
That's a cold observation,
considering the only romance\Nyou've had has been in games.
Yeah, well in games,\Nthe whole idea's
to get your\Nrelationship level up.
That's way more important\Nthan the actual day.
\NOkay.
Yeah, well Valentine's Day's\Njust another day to me.
It's only an excuse for\Nthe boys to get all weird.
Guess no one triggered the\NKagami flag again this year.
Oh yeah?\NYou got anything goin' on?
All kinds of people love me.
In your game, yeah, we got it.
You know, I worry about\Nyou with all your talk
of relationship levels\Nand flags and stuff.
Don't you feel like\Nyou're sort of missing out
if all you do is limit yourself\Nto the world in your games?
Ugh.
I really hate it when\Npeople talk about stuff
they don't know anything about.
Huh.
You saying I'm wrong?
In game time,\Nevents happen pretty fast,
so when you're playing and you\Ncome across Valentine's Day,
it's usually over\Nbefore you know it.
\NSo what?
This year's Valentine's\NDay is different.
I wanna give some\Nchocolate to someone.
You're kidding, really?
Mm-hmm.
It's someone who's playing\Nthe same online game as me.
One of your gaming buddies?
Mm-hmm.
You're gonna hand it\Nto him in person?
Uh-uh, we're not gonna\Nbe seeing each other
in person-person.
\NHuh?
It's all gonna happen in game.
I mean, we're both human\Nbehind our characters,
so what's the difference?
But does that even count?
In the end, it's just\Na character in a game.
Hey, don't insult\Nmy wife like that!
\NHuh, wife?
Mmm.
In the game,\NI play a male character
and I'm married to her.
Uh.
Whoa, in the game the guy's\Ngiving the girl chocolate.
But you're really a girl,\Nso that means
you'll be giving\Nanother girl chocolate?
'Cause the other person's\Na girl, right?
On the contrary, my\Nwife's a guy in real life.
\NHuh?
\NOh, whatever.
As long as everyone's cool\Nand having fun, it's all good.
\NThat's right!
I think I wanna go overseas.
Wow, that came\Noutta nowhere, didn't it?
Well, yesterday,\NMiyuki-san told me...
Women giving chocolates\Nto men on February the 14th
is a tradition that's\Nexclusive only to Japan.
In Western countries,
people give candies and cards\Nto friends and loved ones
regardless of their gender.
Really?
That's exactly what she said,
so that means that even\Na girl like me could give
a whole bunch of candy!
\NThat's one way of looking at it,
provided you're\Nas popular as you think
and not just overconfident.
Oh, it's okay,\N'cause in other countries,
small girls--
Wow, stop!
Let's keep it G-rated, okay?
\NUh, you're rad!
Happy Valentine's Day,\NKona-chan.
This is for you!
Wow, awesome wrapping,\Nfor a uniform,
and the inside's all\Nheart-shaped and everything!
I put a lot of work into it.
Uh, Tsukasa gets pretty\Nelaborate with stuff like that.
She was up all night\Nmaking those,
and they're only\Nfriendship chocolates.
\NEven if these are
friendship chocolates,\Ndon't give them out to boys.
They'll get the wrong idea.
Huh, what?
Huh?
For you, enjoy.
Kagami, you're giving\Nme chocolate?
I only made 'em 'cause\Nshe was making some, too.
Don't be such as spaz.
Oh.
The fact that you worked\Nso hard on making this,
even though you suck at cooking,
totally turns me on, Kagami.
Did you know that?
Oh, shut up and put it away!
Huh?
Kagami?
Here, I made this for you.
Don't get the wrong idea.
It's friendship chocolate.
Friendship, got it?
I'm sorry if they look\Nall weird and everything.
\NDon't be a fool.
I don't care\Nif they look funny.
The important thing's that\Nyou made it for me, Kagami.
Whoa, don't be stupid.
It's nothing like that.
Really, it isn't.
Is that what's goin' on?
No, so shut up and put it away.
\NIt's my first time.
\NFirst time's the best.
Hey, Miyuki-san, did you\Ngive chocolate to anyone?
I gave some to my father\Nand also to a male relative.
And I gave chocolates\Nto pretty much everybody
who's friendly to me.
And I gave some to you,\NTsukasa, and Miyuki.
Come on, did everyone have
the boringest\NValentine's Day, or what?
You live in an online game,\Nso zip it.
You said your cousin\Nwas applying to Ryoo.
What happened with that?
She got accepted.
And since she lives far away,\Nshe's gonna stay at my place
starting next month.
She's always been\Nlike a little sister,
and we've been talkin' a lot\Nabout her moving in.
That's awesome!
But compared to you,\Nisn't it gonna be hard
to tell which of you\Nis the little sister?
You don't get it.
When I say she's little,\Nshe's little, like way little.
\NShe's that small?
That fact she got\Naccepted without any hitches
must mean she's super smart.
Well, someone's\Nsounding confident today.
The school accepted you,\Ndidn't it?
Yeah, but I barely made it.
It still counts though.
I just remembered--\Nwe have to take
our college entrance exams\Nnext year.
Oh brother, we're gonna\Nbe studying forever.
That's gonna be nasty.
Oh no.
Should I take the exams?
I don't have any plans\Nfor the future.
You really need to start\Nthinking about your future.
Hmm, "academic"\Nand "labor" are words
that just don't exist\Nin my vocabulary.
\NI wonder what someone like her
could do for a living.
She could design games, 'cause\Nthat's her hobby, anyway.
She could make her own manga\Nand sell it at Comiket.
She's naturally curious,\Nso she could be a reporter.
No, maybe she becomes a writer
who writes\Nfor a specific genre.
She's good with computers,\Nmaybe a web designer?
Or a screen writer, who\Nwrites about random things
that don't have a plot?
Or she goes to college.
Or, maybe it's all\Nthe same damn thing!
What?
Hmm.
Hmpf!
What's up?
She's here.
Boss, it's really her,\Nthe Legendary Girl!
Ay!
What?
We let her get away\Nfrom us last time.
-Boss!\N-Boss!
Boss!
But not today!
We'll do everything in\Nour power to make sure
that the the Legendary Girl A\Ngets to the cash register!
\NHmm.
Giro, she's having\Na hard time deciding.
Hahaha!
Then it's up to us
to make her purchasing\Ndecisions for her!
All right,\Npeople, you ready?
\NYeah!
Say what?\NYeah!
Say what?\NYeah!
\NSay what?
\NYeah, you know it!
\NHmm.
I have a visual, boss.
I'm gonna try to figure out\Nwhat the Legendary Girl A
is looking for.
I'm counting on you.
What's the newest manga?
It's Sergeant Frog,\Nvolume 14, sir!
\NPerfect!
Make sure you display them
in the Legendary Girl A's\Nline of sight!
Deploy the flyers!
Tama!
\NLocked and loaded, sir!
\NGood.
Keep an eye on her movements.
Make sure our best sellers are\Nflanking the Legendary Girl A
as she approaches the register!
\NRoger!
\NSir!
\NEh.
Ugh!
The Legendary Girl A is\Nnot looking for a manga,
repeat,\Nnot looking for manga!
What?
Boss, she's headed\Nfor the DVD section.
Fantastic!
I want blockades up on\Nboth sides of the aisle.
We're gonna funnel\Nthe Legendary Girl A
straight into the new releases.
\NRoger!
\NSir!
Oops, sorry, am I in your way?
Tama, tama?
Oh, I'm so very sorry!
That a girl.
Ugh!
Boss!
Finally, we got her!
She's gonna buy something!
I did it! I won! I beat her!
We're gonna party like rock\Nstars tonight, you hear me?
-Woohoo!\N-Woohoo, Sir!
\NHuh.
She faked us out!
Agh!
\NOh!
Ugh, this calls for\Nmy secret weapon.
Bring me that\Nultra rare, out-of-print,
bargain bin DVD, girl.
Boss, she's\Nheaded straight for you.
Yes, that's it.
This is so beautiful,\NI never want this scene to end.
The entire U.S. of A\Ninside me is all cheering
and applauding!
\NYay for us!
Yay, sir!
1,785 yen, please.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Darn it, I'm short three yen.
Oh well.
Could you guys\Nput it back for me?
Thanks.
Foiled again!
\NLucky Star.
\NLucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
All righty, let's get this\Nthing movin' already!
I can't believe Lucky\NChannel's on its 13th episode.
Isn't that amazing?
I'm your navigator,\NAkira Kogami,
but you guys knew that\Nalready, didn't you?
I bet you did, a-ha!
Nice to see you again!
I'm Minoru Shiraishi,\NAkira-sama's faithful assistant.
Isn't this great?
We're on our 13th episode,\Nand that means
we're in our second season.
In fact, getting\Nthis far is a lot like
reaching the halfway station\Non Mt. Fuji,
isn't that right, Akira-sama?
Huh?
You can get to the halfway\Nstation by car, you idiot.
Well, of course you can,\NI was just saying.
Oh, that's right.
This one time, I climbed\Nto the top of Mt. Takao--
What are you, blind?
Aren't you gonna say anything?
-Right. I though of...\N-D-d-d-d-d-d-d-drills!
Oh my, Akira-sama, those\Ntwin drills you're sporting
are really cool!
What's so cool\Nabout 'em, slack jaw?
Well, they're all wound up\Nlike a couple of seashells?
Huh?
-Oh, my god.\N-D-d-drill.
Oh, that's right!
Today we're\Nannouncing the results
of our very own Lucky Star\NAction Figure Project!
Akira-sama, if you'd be so\Nkind as to announce the winner.
Konata Izumi gets her\Nvery own action figure--
Akira-sama,\Nread it properly!
Congratulations, woohoo!
Ugh!
Was there any doubt she'd win?
This thing was rigged\Nfrom the beginning,
so basically the radio show
and the LC aren't important,\Nis that it?
Oh, sure, it's all about\Nthe main segment.
You got it all wrong.\NWe're important, aren't we?
Mmm-hmm.
You see, the producer\Nsays we're important!
There it is!
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever, I'm used to getting
bent over all the time anyways.
I don't really care anymore.
Bent over is not a very\Nnice way of putting it.
Yeah, bet you're\Nall torn up about it.
And next, you're gonna\Ntell me that they made
an action figure out of you,\Nisn't that right?
No, of course not, God forbid!
Any crap, Konata Izumi gets\Nher very own action figure,
and as a booby prize,\NMinoru Shiraishi gets one, too.
You've gotta be\Nfreaking kidding!
Ugh! Not good.
Oh, it looks like\Nour time's up for today.
Keep sending us\Nyour comments, questions,
and any good things you might\Nhave to say about the show.
You can use our\Nhomepage if you want
or you can send your letters\Nthe old-fashioned way.
Right, Akira-sama?
I'm going.
Whoa, wait a second!
Bye-ni!
Akira-sama, wait up!
\NOkay people, listen up.
\ND-drill!
\NOn the next episode
of Sergeant Frog...
\NNo!
Say, "On the next episode\Nof Lucky Star!"
\NGiro, Giro.
Sir, I just thought\Nof something awesome.
Did you know that anime\Nis a global industry?
We could use it to\Nbrainwash the Pekoponians
and complete our invasion\Nof Pekopon in no time!
\NOh, Sarge, you're so smart!
\NHa, pathetic.
Why don't you\Nact like a soldier
and crush them\Nwith brute force?
\NShut up, you red daruma!
\NUgh?
\NThese days,
the one with the information
wins the war, but seeing\Nas how you're so old,
you probably don't get it.
\NWatch your mouth, damn you!
\NYeah, whatever.
Next time, under one roof!
\NLook forward to it!
\NGi-Giro!
\NOkay, let's do this.
\NSure, let's go.
\NGrrr!
\NQuit screwin' around and start!
Yutaka! Come on,\Nwe gotta get going.
Upsy daisy.
Okay, sis.
Get ready for the first\Nday of your new life.
Let's rock, man!
\NAhh!
Ahh!
Attention, everyone!
I'm here to announce\Nthat Yutaka got accepted!
Woohoo! Bring her in already.
Come on, Yutaka.
Well, I just wanted\Nto say thank you
for letting me stay with you.
And I promise\NI won't be any trouble.
Just go ahead and make\Nyourself at home here, okay?
Oh, thanks.
By the way, congrats\Non getting accepted.
Oh, thank you!
Man, I'm so glad\Nyou got accepted.
You'll get to hang out\Nwith that handkerchief...
\NI'm a winner.
I'm living the dream.
Are you all right?
Oh!
Do you want me to take\Nyou to the nurse's office?
\NShe actually talked to me.
And then she let me\Nborrow her handkerchief.
It makes me all happy
'cause I'm gonna have\Na best friend now.
That's really cool and all,
but what if she\Ndoesn't get accepted?
Uhh...
No! People like her\Nalways get accepted! Always!
I know how you feel.\NIt's just that--
And she's probably\Nreally smart, too!
I didn't say she wasn't.
Thanks for clearing that up,\Nthough.
Hang on.
Yu-chan,\Nwhat would you have done
if you didn't get accepted?
Oh, I know, I know.\NDon't remind me.
Don't sweat it, Yu-chan.\NI'm sure you're gonna be okay.
You're right!
I'll see her again on\Nthe day they announce
the names of the people\Nwho got accepted.
Yeah, maybe.
I still have to return\Nthe handkerchief to her.
\N'Scuse me!
Here. I'm really glad\Nto see you again.
And I've been wanting to\Ngive this back to you.
You wanna give it back?
Yes.
Sorry. I didn't\Nwanna trouble you.
I gave it to you thinking\Nthat you would keep it.
To be honest,\NI really didn't think
I'd ever see you again.
You didn't think I'd be\Naccepted here, did you?
No.
I see.
Now I get it. You must be\Nin the same grade as I am.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
It's okay. I guess you thought\NI was someone's kid sister.
My family's\Npicking me up today, so--
Oh, okay.
Well, goodbye, then.
Um, I hope that\Nthe next three years
are gonna be awesome for us.
\NI'm so lucky.
I haven't even\Nstarted high school,
and I've already got\Na good friend.
Oh, I forgot to ask her name.
\NWhen you see her again,
make sure you ask for her name.
-Mmm.\N-Mmm.
How are you feeling?\NAre you sick or something?
Oh, yeah. It was the ride over.\NI got a little carsick.
I did take some\Nmedicine, though.
Don't worry.\NI'll be okay in a bit.
Yutaka's such a frail and\Ndelicate little girl, ain't she?
Wait. Sure she is,\Nbut seriously.
Do you have any idea what\Nyour driving's like, Onee-san?
I mean \Neven I got a little...
I wonder\Nif I'm gonna get along
with all my new classmates\Nat Ryouou High.
I mean, I'm the only one
out of my old school\Nthat made it in,
and if I get sick\Nreal easy like today--
Don't worry, Yutaka. You're\Na good girl. You'll be fine.
Grr. Stop treating me\Nlike a little kid!
\NHm...
Thinking...
Converting...
If you and Miyuki-san\Nteamed up, that would be
the most awesomest thing in\Nthe history of everything.
Huh?
That's right. I'm living in\NKonata Onee-chan's house now.
Oh. Oh!
Good morning, Onee-chan.
Why you up so early\Non a holiday?
Oh. Actually I was\Nabout to jump into bed.
So I guess it's good night.
I was up playing\Ngames all n--
This place is way\Ndifferent than my house!
You know how we've got
college entrance exams\Ncoming up next year?
We've been getting\Nall these calls
from cram schools and\Ntelemarketers selling textbooks.
Man, they're so annoying.
However, if you have\Ncaller ID on your phone,
you can tell right away
if someone like that\Nis calling you.
On the display, the number\Nshows up as restricted.
\NI'm home!
Caller ID, huh?
Hello, Mother. I'm home.
Oh, you can't be serious.
I can't imagine how much\Ntrouble that must've been.
Oh no, it's the same way\Nin our family. Absolutely.
I'm sorry to cut you off, but my\Ndaughter's just come home.
Yes, yes, we'll talk again soon.
All right then,\Nhave a wonderful day.
You are you talking to?
It sounded like\Na lively conversation.
Oh, that was just\Na telemarketer.
Mother, I'm sorry,\Nbut didn't you see
it was a telemarketer\Nwhen they were calling?
Yes, but I was bored.
So I decided to have\Na conversation anyway.
And we ended up talking\Nfor more than an hour.
\NOkay, the total comes to--
What was that about winning\Nthe National Championship?
Tsukasa,\Nthe world's a war zone!
You can never show mercy, ever!
The other day,\NI saw this thing
I wanted to get\Nwith my reward points.
So I thought,\N"Do I go offense and get it
or defense and save my\Npoints?" So I got it!
But now there's a new\Nthing that just came out
and I wanna get it\Nbefore anyone else!
It's that one over there, but\NI don't have enough points!
What'll I do? What'll I do?
Someone sure enjoys\Ntheir life, don't they?
Um, you gonna pay?
Okay, where would y'all\Nlike to sit?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Uh, yeah, since we're a\Nlittle on the underage side,
maybe we'll go\Nwith non-smoking.
Come this way, please.
Um, I gotta go\Nto the bathroom first.
Okay.
Oh, hey, Tsukasa, we're\Nover here. Over here!
Took you long enough.
I know. Sorry.
I have to say this, 'cause\NI think about it a lot.
But you know when\Nyou go to a restaurant
and need to use the bathroom?
How come it's always\Nby the smoking section?
Yeah, right?
Especially since we went
out of our way\Nto get non-smoking.
Seriously, though, I wonder\Nwhy they have it like that.
Well, if someone starts a fire,\Nthey got a place close by
where they can get their\Nhands on some water.
They can fill up buckets\Nthere and hook up a hose.
Oh, I didn't know they\Nhad a hose back there.
Of course they do. You\Ndidn't know they had a hose?
Hah! That's right.
Someone's never worked a single\Nday out in the real world.
No, she hasn't.
-Nope. Not at all.\N-Okay, shut up.
Or one covers the stink\Nof the other, maybe?
We're gonna eat, so stop talking\Nabout toilets and stinks.
It's kinda gross, okay?
And in other news,\Na number of incidents
have occurred recently,
where girls on their\Nway to elementary school
have been approached from behind\Nand harassed by a stranger.
We're starting to see\Na lot of stuff like that
happening to kids lately.
You better be careful\Nwhen you go out, Yu-chan.
Yeah, I will.
Unacceptable!
But I can understand how\Nhe's probably feeling.
You understand him?
They talk about this guy\Non the news every day,
making a big deal out of him.
It's amazing to think that\Nthere's someone out there
harassing little girls\Nlike that.
And if I had the chance,\NI'd tell him,
"Aren't you jealous of me?"
I'm a little worried\Nabout your thinking, Dad.
Just please don't do anything
that Yui-neisan\Ncan arrest you for, okay?
Huh?
\NLucky Star!
\NIs anybody home?
\NYes!
Yoohoo! Hello!
Come on in.
Where's Kagami?\NWhat's she up to?
Oh, she's hanging out
with a couple of her friends\Nfrom class.
Oh, yeah?
It's just, I don't know.
It feels like something's\Nmissing, and it's frustrating.
Maybe 'cause you miss her.
Man, is it me, or has it\Ngotten super-warm out lately?
Yeah, it has.
Isn't it peaceful now\Nthat we're on spring break
and don't have\Nany homework to do?
Yeah, it is.
\NYes, it is.
And I think\Nthat line's reserved
for those who actually\Ndo their homework,
as opposed to copying it.
\NDon't get in any strange places.
\NThat's impossible!
So, when you're playing\Nrobot games like this,
do you really know who all\Nthe characters are and stuff?
Yeah. I guess\Nyou could say I do.
Hmm. Really?
'Cause I remember\Nyou said that your taste
in anime and manga was\Nall because of your dad.
\NYup.
Oh, yeah?
So when you were younger,\Ndid you have a hard time
keeping up with the girls
when they started talking\Ngirl stuff?
Hmm? I didn't have a hard time\Nkeeping up with anything.
I got to see way more
of that kinda stuff\Nthan they ever did.
Oh. Uh, yeah.
Okay.
Is that your final answer?
\NThat's my final answer!
Man, that big ol' pause he\Ntakes kills me every time.
And his face is so big,\Nit's scary.
\NOh, it looks like
the show's about to end.
I guess she got\Nthe question wrong.
Oh, come on!
You're guessing if they\Ngot the question right
by looking at how much time
the show's got left\Nbefore the commercial.
Yeah, but I can't stand\Nthe suspense of not knowing.
They drag it out too long.
But the show's all about\Nenjoying that part of it.
Yup, that's our Tsukasa.
Hey, you!
Hey, you, too.\NWell, here she is.
My cousin, Yu-chan.\NGo on, say hi.
It's nice to meet you.\NI'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
And these are my best\Nfriends, Kagami and Tsukasa.
Yeah, I know.
You're the ones Onee-chan\Nalways talks about.
Oh? What kinda stuff has\Nshe been saying about us?
Uh...
What in the hell have\Nyou been telling this girl?
The way she looked just now,\NI wonder.
\NSee? You see? What'd I tell ya?
So, did you already have\Nyour graduation ceremony?
Oh, yes. The other day.
Wow. Graduation.\NWhat memories, huh, guys?
I don't really remember\Nmy graduation ceremony.
So did you get a button
from any of the guys in\Nyour class, Yutaka-chan?
Oh no. I didn't.
At my old junior high,\Nour uniform was a blazer.
That's right.
I guess a lot of schools\Nare like that these days.
Although, maybe it's because\Nthere's not a whole lot
of that "getting something\Nfrom your crush"
stuff going on anymore.
You really think so?
It sounds kinda sad, but I\Nguess I never did it myself.
Every now and then,\NI'll read a blog
where someone's\Ntalking about that stuff,
so it's sorta still going on.
Wait a minute.
It's all about getting something
from someone you like, right?
Isn't that the whole point\Nof doing it?
But then you totally\Nout yourself as having
a crush on the guy when\Nyou go get the button.
Why don't you ask the guy out
and get the whole guy\Ninstead of just a button?
Ideally, yeah.
I guess that's what\Nyou'd wanna have happen.
So, Yutaka-chan,\Ndid you have someone
that you had\Na crush on or something?
Oh, not me.
I'd have to stay home a lot\N'cause I felt sick.
Even when I went to class,\NI'd start feeling ill.
I think I kinda made\Neveryone around me depressed.
And there's the fact that\NI'm really short and frail
and I kinda look like\Na little kid.
Everyone was always\Nmaking fun of me.
Why would anybody fall in\Nlove with me, you know?
You'll be fine, Yu-chan.
There's definitely\Na need for girls like you
as long as you aren't picky.
Huh? Picky?
Pocky. Hey, Yu-chan, can I\Ntake a look at your yearbook?
Me, too.\NI wanna see your yearbook.
Well, it's a little\Nembarrassing.
There's not a lot of\Npictures of me or anything.
Hmm.
So what class were you in again?
Wait a second!
Were you checking the absentee\Nlist for my name just now?
You were, weren't you?
Oh, was I being that obvious?
Hmm!
You wanna know the difference
between junior high\Nand high school?
-Mm-hmm.\N-I know.
For one thing,\Nthey don't make you join
an extracurricular club.
I don't know. Doesn't\Nthat depend on the school?
Well, one difference is\Nthat we're a prep school,
so our curriculum's\Nbigger and faster-paced
than the one you had\Nin junior high.
And I guess you'll need more\Nstamina than in junior high
'cause the commute to\Nschool's really long.
One difference I've noticed
is that from elementary\Nschool through high school,
the time you spend\Nsleeping at your desk
gets longer and longer.
Especially during hard classes.
Yeah, that's totally true!
Like when you start drifting off
'cause the teacher's talking--
No matter what you do, do\Nnot end up like them, okay?
Okay.
\NHey, Yu-chan,
I see you kept your old\Njunior high uniform.
Yeah, I thought maybe\NI could wear it
as my street clothes\Nwithout anyone noticing.
It looks plain enough,\Ndon't you think?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Kagami. What'd you\Nguys do with your uniforms?
Oh, we gave ours to a couple
of younger girls\Nin our neighborhood.
What about you?
What about me?
You probably\Ncouldn't find anyone
tiny enough to give it to.
Two things, Kagami:\Nyou're rude and shut up.
Anyway, I did what Yu-chan did.
I kept mine\Nfor cosplay purposes.
C-cos?
Yeah, when you put it that\Nway, it sounds really bad.
Like, really bad.
It's just cosplay, man.
Talking about it sure\Nbrings back memories.
Sometimes I think it'd be cool
to go back to my elementary\Nschool and junior high,
see my old teachers\Nand say hi and stuff.
But there's been all this stuff
about people\Ntrespassing at schools.
If you went back, chances are
you'd get funny looks\Nfrom everyone.
Yeah, and if you went back,\Nyou'd fit right in.
It'd be like you never left.
I'm pretty sure\Nyou weren't trying
to compliment me there,\Nwere you?
Our vacation went by\Nfast this time, didn't it?
I hear that.
It's like before you know it,
school's about to start\Nall over again.
And now that spring's here,
we've got all those physical\Nexams and fitness tests.
Oh man, what a pain.
But you're lucky, Kona-chan.
Your motor nerves are so good.
Hey, Tsukasa,
which nerves are supposed to\Nbe the motor nerves anyway?
Hello, everybody!\NHow's it going?
Sorry I'm late. And congrats\Non the graduating, Yutaka.
Hey, neisan. Come on in.
'Cause we're celebrating\Na graduation,
how about we all\Ngo out drinking together?
It's my treat.\NUncle Sojiro's going.
\NWoah!
\NExcuse me, Officer?
We're underage.
Onee-chan, I don't think
they'll even let us\Nthrough the door.
You should know\Nbetter than that.
They won't\Nnotice if you walk in
like you're supposed\Nto be there.
When I was a student,\NI did it all the time,
and I never got caught, man.\NNot even once.
\NUh-uh.
Your two little relatives\Nwould totally blow our cover.
\NHm, really?
You'll live.
\NI was thinking it might be nice
if we all went out to the\Namusement park or something.
It's still vacation.
Ohh.
Um, that sounds like\Nfun and everything,
but you don't have to.
I don't wanna be a burden.
I'd feel bad if you go to\Nall that trouble for me.
Besides, I went there\Non a field trip
with my class the other day.
Hey!
I just remembered I went there
on field trip with\Nmy class, too.
How about it, though?\NWere you okay there?
Mm-hmm. I didn't get sick\Nthe whole time I was there.
And I got to hang out\Nwith my friends.
No, I mean were you okay
with the height restrictions\Non the rides?
What are you talking about?\NI was fine.
I'm in high school now, okay?
You know, I was watching
a school drama show\Nand I got to thinking.
Junior high and high school
are totally different,\Naren't they?
Huh? Well, yeah.
And I heard that the lunches
aren't given out\Nlike in junior high.
Yeah, I guess not.
Either you bring your own lunch
or you gotta buy one\Nin the cafeteria.
Or you could buy lunch\Nand bring it.
Do you make a lunch
to take to school every day,\NOnee-chan?
\NWell, yeah, sure.
Wow!
You're cool!
\NUh-oh, this isn't good.
\NShe's really good at games.
She can communicate\Nall kinds of ways.
And she cooks and does chores!
So yeah,\NI think I'm getting an idea
of the pressure you\Nfeel as an older sister.
When she looks at me\Nwith those big eyes,
I feel like I gotta\Ndo my best, you know?
\NHuh?
\NYui-neisan drives like a maniac.
Aha! What's up? How ya doing?
\NYui-neisan gets drunk
and crashes at our place.
Homework, huh?
Eh, as long as\Nyou keep it vague,
put down whatever you want.
\NYui-neisan says
irresponsible things.
But then again I wonder\Nif it depends on the person.
\NI have no idea
what you're talking about.
\NLucky Star.
My final answer is\Nmy ass, buddy.
I am not doing this anymore.\NUh-uh...
\NAnd she's mad again.
...and when I watch the\Ndamn thing, where'd I go?
\NShould I do it? I'm gonna do it.
Aw yeah, I'm gonna do it.
Uh, Akira-sama, you forgot to\Ncall out the title. The title.
Huh?
Uh, please call out\Nthe title, please?
-\N-Tiny eyes.
Hiya, luckies.
Like any of it matters.\NWhat a friggin' crock.
Right now,\NI am so disgusted, man.
All I get's a voice cameo?\NMe. Just my voice.
Whoopdie-doodle-doo!
Well, they didn't give me\Nany screen time, either--
Who cares?\NI wasn't talking about you!
\NWindy.
Well, Sunshine, did anyone\Nask about you just now? Huh?
At any time\Nduring the conversation,
was your flippin' name\Never brought up?
Uh, no, I guess nobody said\Nanything about me.
Then why the hell are\Nyou butting in like that?
You just come sliding out\Nwith your big fat head.
What are you,\Nstupid or something?
Always cutting me off\Nwith your me-me-me thing.
Looks like someone's\Nself-centered, eh, Shiraishi?
Ugh, this thing is leaving\Na film in my mouth.
Listen up, Peaches,\Nthe problem
is that I, Akira Kogami,\Nwas not shown
on screen in the main segment.
\NI know!
Let me ask you something.\NI'm an idol, right? I am.
Well, an idol's face is\Ntheir number-one asset.
It needs to be on screen,\Nor am I wrong?
Yes! I mean, no!\NI mean, you're absolutely right!
Huh? I did not hear you.
Ah! What the staff did to you
was completely inexcusable\Nand unprofessional.
May I ask what you're\Nwriting over there?
Okay, guys!\NAkira needs your help!
I need all your support\Nso that I, Akira Kogami,
can show up in the main\Nsegment of the show.
So make sure you send in\Nwads of requests for it.
\NWhat?
I don't care how you get\Nthe message out there.
Just push hard for me, okay?
I really want you guys to\Nsee how good an actor I am.
I really, really want it!
-Really, really?\N-And, just between us,
Compared to my charms, the\Nother cast members got nothing.
It's really too sad. Yup.
It's sort of like\Nif you compared
an Oscar-winning\NHollywood actress...
\NShe's getting desperate.
Really desperate.
Hee-hee.\NMy acting's on a higher level!
It's pretty. It's gorgeous.\NYou'll wanna see more!
So here's your chance\Nto do something good.
Write a letter or leave\Na comment on the site.
Your voices will\Ncount for something.
All your wishes\Nwill come true...
\NSomething wrong?
...if you guys can get me\Nan on-camera role in Lucky Star!
What? Stop her? Really?
Um, hey, Akira-sama--
Shut the hell up!
What's with all the chitchat\Nwhen my career's at stake?
How many times\NI gotta tell you?
When I'm talking, you\Nbetter shut your stupid--
You're kidding!
Aw, I was just\Ngetting to the part
where I tell you\Nhow fabulous I am.
Or maybe I could show you\Nguys just how awesome I am
in the main segment\Nof the next episode.
Just kidding!
Yeah. We'll see you all\Nin the next episode.
-Bye!\N-
\NThat was so freaking painful.
Go get me the producer.\NChop chop!
\NWhat, who, me?
You awake?
This is supposed to be\Na revised script, yeah?
So what in the hell is\Nthe title of our segment?
\NHuh? Well, it's Lucky Channel.
\NYeah, script says
Lucky Paradise.
-Well, I--\N-Shut up!
And another thing--
they've got some nerve\Ntreating me like that.
"Hi, I'm a producer. I worked\Non a show that was a hit
so that means\NI can be a total--"
\NNo, what are you saying, stop!
You can't talk to him like that!
\NOn the next episode
of Lucky Star...
\NI'm Minami Iwasaki.
\NAnd I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
I guess they want the two of us
to introduce\Nthe next episode, right?
But, do you know\Nwhat it's about?
\NNo. I'm sorry, I don't.
\NWhat, really?
Oh, that's not good.
I don't know anything\Nabout it, either.
Oh, well.\NGuess I'll just wrap it up.
Next time,\N"I Can't Suddenly Change."
I hope no one minds we\Ndidn't say anything.
\NLook forward to it.
\NSenior year, Class B...
\NMs. Kuroi!
\NYeah, yeah.
Do any of you know what\Nthe heck this line's for?
Yuki Chan, do you know?
No, I don't.
Well, guys.
I should have known.
And before you get your hopes\Nup, I didn't win either.
It seems I've won.
I did too.
You're the\Nbest friends I ever had.
What about me?
Oh, man, I can't see anything.
Come on.
Ohh.
\NThat was amazing!
\NI was so impressed.
\NDid you guys see the emcee,
I thought he was super cute.
\NUh, you're kidding.
\NYou didn't think so?
\NNot really my type.
Are you feeling okay, Konata?
You're awfully quiet.
Huh? Uh-huh.
I guess the concert really\Ntook it out of you didn't it?
I mean, it was pretty impressive
and I'm even feeling drained.
Uh-huh, I wonder what\Nthis feeling I'm feeling is.
-What are you doing?\N-Huh?
Come on, let's go.
You pick the weirdest things\Nto get all proactive about.
It's the last day to see\Nthe cherry blossoms blooming,
I don't want to miss it.
Besides, when you put\Nit off for the next day
or the day after,\Nsomething always happens.
It'll rain and all the petals\Nwill start falling off.
Hey, what happened\Nto that goldfish
you caught at the summer\Nfestival last year?
Hmm, actually, I sort\Nof gave him too much food
and now he's, like, this big.
That's big like a shogun!
I guess I pamper\Nthe little guy too much.
Wait a minute.
Are you sure you're feeding it\Nthe right food?
'Cause that thing is definitely\Nnot a goldfish anymore.
Maybe he's fat\Nbecause he's living
a happy peaceful life, you know?
So are you gonna eat him?
What are you saying?
That reminds me of this anime\Nwith pets
who die and return human.
They go back to their owners\Nand they're all,
"welcome home, master"
Here you go with another\Nhardcore reference.
Maybe I should put him\Non a little diet.
Kagami...
You're not gonna replace him\Nwith a skinnier one, are you?
What?
It's getting pretty cold,\Nisn't it?
I guess we'll head home.
It kind of sucks\Nwhen you're out to see the
cherry blossoms at night, but\Nyou're not dressed for it.
Your butt gets so cold while\Nyou're sitting down too.
I heard somewhere the\Naverage temperature in March
is basically the same\Nas December's.
And April's average temperature\Nis similar to November's.
Wow, if this\Nwas November or December,
I'd be piling on the layers.
\NYeah, and in March and April,
you never seem\Nto have enough layers on.
\NMaybe it's 'cause you get tired
of wearing your winter clothes.
Perhaps it's\Nhow one subconsciously
expresses their desire\Nfor spring to arrive.
Hey, Kagami,\Ndoesn't look like she's cold.
Huh?
So she must have come prepared\Nwearing wool undies, huh?
I am not!
Ah, sorry, Keopie,\Nthat's all you get today.
If this thing comes back to\Nme as an aggressive boyfriend,
I am so gonna be hating my life.
I wonder what's wrong with her.
\NMan, my nose hurts.
My skin's so delicate,
it's gotten raw\Nfrom all this blowing.
This time of year always does\Nthis to me, it's relentless.
That sucks, Dad.
I guess\NI'm always home anyway.
Don't worry, I heard\Nthere's lots of stuff
you can buy now that helps\Nwith hay fever and allergies.
Oh, really?
Transformation.
This rocks!
And it's cutting out\Nlike 99% of the pollen.
Now you're as suspicious\Non the outside
as you are on the inside.
Please, Dad, don't let\Nthe police catch you like that.
Well, I'm off to the store now.
Okay, have fun, Dad.
You wanna go?
Nah, no, thanks.
Hold it, Dad, you're not going\Nout there like that, are you?
Why not? That's why I got my\Ngear on, I'll be okay.
On to our next story.
Around 11:00 last night,\Na woman barged
into a convenience store\Nand attempted
to walk out\Nwith the day's earnings.
-Hey, Yu-chan.\N-Uh-huh?
I was thinking that maybe\Nall these convenience store
robbers are really just\Npretending to have allergies.
Huh, yeah, I guess\Nyou're right.
-Freeze!\N-Why me?
-Whoa.\N-What, tomorrow?
Yeah, let's go, we haven't\Ndone that in a while.
And I finished all\Nof my homework by myself.
Huh, did you say by yourself?
No way, you're kidding\Nright, you really did?
Nope, I lied.
Come on, it's April Fools,\Ndid you forget?
Didn't you tell a lie today?\NThat's what it's about.
I guess you're not gonna do\Nyour homework by yourself.
You must be so bored,
calling me up at this hour\Njust to April Fools me.
Whatever, Slackenstein,\NI'll see you tomorrow.
Izumi residence.
Oh, hiya, this is Kuroi.
Oh, hi, ma'am.
Oh, hey, it's me, so\Nthat game you let me borrow,
I sort of accidentally\Nsaved over your data.
What?
I got you.
I so got you,\Nyou totally fell for it.
April Fools!
She must be so bored calling\Nthis late.
Uh, ma'am...
Yeah, what's up?
The other day Miyuki-san said...
Come now,\Nbeing a teacher is such
an easy job, I mean if\NMrs. Kuroi can do it.
That's what she said.
That brat, so that\Nnice crap's all an act, huh?
Um, ma'am, April Fools.
So basically Konata called
just to April Fools me,\Nunbelievable.
You have a chance to trick\Nanyone with a lie today?
Uh, yeah, I did.
No way, you did?
What was the lie you told?
Uh, what I said just now.
I lied when I said I lied.
You what? Wait,
you don't have to force yourself\Nto tell a lie today, you know?
So, what kind of lie\Ndid Kona-chan tell?
Mmm, she said she finished\Nher homework all by herself,
and I was pretty dumb\Nto fall for it too.
Everyone knows that'll never\Nhappen.
If she was lying, it means she\Nhasn't finished her homework.
Knowing her, I'm positive\Nshe hasn't finished it.
Oh, okay.
You're just glad someone's
in the same boat as you,\Naren't you?
Uh, well I--
Hmm?
Hey, Konata, you got a minute?
Mm-hmm.
So, is it interesting?
Yeah, unique.
Hmm, well that's good.
Konata, I'm thinking about\Ngetting married again,
-and, well, there it is, okay?\N-Okay.
No, it's perfectly normal\Nyou'd be against the idea,
Kanata's your real mom\Nand she always will be,
but that's not what, huh?
Wait a sec, Konata, are you\Nsaying if I get married again,
you're okay with it?
Sure, why not?
And you do know\Nthat it means
you'll have a new mom, right?
You're still okay with that?
Oh, yeah, so what's my\Nnew mom gonna be like?
Yeah, well, I mean\Nit's a pretty serious thing.
You can't take new mothers\Nlightly, unh-unh.
Next question,\Nwhat is the modest and polite
form of the word... "iku."
That's an easy one,\Nit's... "ukagau."
Yeah, you're right.\NIt's definitely... "ukagau."
I'm with you girls\Non that one.
-Oh, come on, of course it is.\N-Mm-hmm.
\NAnd the answer is "mairu."
Oh yeah,\Nyeah that's right.
I guess it is,\Nisn't it?
Great, now it's all weird.\NIt's always like this when
someone who thinks they're\Nright finds out they're wrong.
The first\Nmultiple choice question is,
which of the following\Nprefectures
do not face towards the ocean?
Is it A, Ibaraki,
or is it B, Tochigi,
or is it C, Kyoto?
It's B!
-B right?\N-Definitely B.
This one's way too easy.
And the answer is B.
Next question.
The most famous problem in\Nthe history of mathematics
was finally proven\Nby Professor Wiles
of Princeton University in 1994.
Which of the following\Nthree choices
is the name of that theorem?
Is it A,\Nthe Pythagorean theorem,
or is it B,\NTaylor's theorem,
or C,\NFermat's last theorem?
Funny how everyone's so quick\Nto answer when it's obvious,
but when it's not,\Nthey all clam up.
Hey, guys, before our\Nspring break's over,
what do you say we all go\Nand hang out at Miyuki-san's?
Awesome idea, I always\Nwanted to see her place,
but it's so far away.
Miyuki-san's rich, I bet\Nher house is really amazing.
I wonder what it's like.
Maybe she's got a swimming pool.
Maybe she's got security guards\Nall around the perimeter.
Oh, come on, that's silly.
Oh, I bet she's got a pet\Nor something like that.
I always pictured her\Nhaving a white ferret,
a really cute one.
Unh-unh, a dog, a big white dog,
and she's got a big backyard\Nand a white parasol.
Well, the dog's a possibility.
So, that's pretty much\Nhow that conversation went.
You're welcome to come over,
but please don't get\Nyour hopes up.
For one thing,\Nwe don't have any pets at all.
Oh, but one of our neighbors has
all the criteria\Nyou're looking for.
They have a big white dog,\Nand I believe a parasol.
Ahh, she said her neighbor's\Ngoing to be starting
Ryoo high school this year too.
Really?
Hey, you wanna come\Nalong if we invite her?
One of my friends has\Na cousin who will be
starting her first year\Nat Ryoo this spring.
\NIt really is a small world,
don't you think?
Lucky Star.
I'm super sleepy today.
'Course you are,\Nthat's 'cause you're
always waking up in the middle\Nof the day.
Oh, there's Konata.
Hey!
Got in the habit of sleeping\Nin too, huh?
I've been gaming my brains\Nout for three days straight.
I'm gonna die.
These guys have one thing\Nin common, they're totally lazy.
Look, we're in the same\Nclass again.
Yeah, you're right,\Nisn't that awesome?
Good morning.
Hi, Yuki-chan, good morning.
Morning. Guess what.\NYou're in the same class as us.
Really?\NOh, there I am, fantastic.
I hope we all have\Na great year together.
I second that.
Wow, look we're\Nin the same class.
Mm-hmm.
I hope the two of us\Nhave a good year together.
So do I.
Hey, Kagami's in a different\Nclass again.
It's not like I don't see\Nyou guys all the time anyway.
I mean, if I wasn't\Nin a different class,
you guys would wear me out.
I think it's a shame.
Not even, this is the\Nway it's always been.
Besides, Konata's gonna be\Nswinging by all the time
to borrow notes\Nor a book or something anyway.
You read my mind.
So it's cool, okay?\NI'll see you guys later.
\NOkay, sis, see you later.
Hey, Hiiragi,
you think we're in the same\Nclass again?
Yep, we're in the same class\Nagain.
Man, we've been in the same\Nclass together
five years in a row.
Let's have another good one.
Uh...
Yeah, sure.
You see that? Some people\Nare so focused on their goals,
they end up getting all\Ncold-hearted and stuff.
Oh, be nice.
What are we the background\Nscenery or somethin'?
What kind of standards\Ndo you think
they use when they split up\Nthe classes?
Let's see,\NI heard they try to sort classes
based on average test scores.
They also separate students\Ndepending on
who's related to whom.
Oh, and they also try to put
the troublemakers\Nin different classes.
Ultimately, I think it depends
on the school you're attending.
Well, on TV and in the movies,
they always put all\Nthe bad kids in the same class.
It's more compelling.
But high schools are\Nsupposed to make sure
that everyone who goes\Nthere is at the same level,
so there shouldn't be\Nany troublemakers around.
You do have a point.
Miyuki, this is where\Nyou tell her she happens
to be one of the\Ntroublemakers at this school,
and you don't want to be seen\Nwith a troublemaker do you?
It's nothing like that.
That was the bell,\Nbut our teacher's not here yet.
I know, I wonder what's up.
Sit your butts down right now!
That was close,\Nbut I made it.
Just barely.
Listen up, I'm Kuroi,\Nyour teacher.
Since y'all made it this far,
it's important you guys\Nsnap out of vacation mode,
change your ways, and become the\Nawesome students I know you are.
You gotta be kidding me.
I'm not gonna yak all day about
how y'all need to study hard.
But you're all seniors now,
so make your time count\Nwhile you're here.
Let's get to handing\Nout the class duties.
Takara, you wanna\Nbe the class rep
-for the first half of the year?\N-Oh, yes, ma'am.
I tell ya, once you've been\Na class rep, it's really hard
to get people to think of\Nyou as being anything else.
Yes, that's true.
But it's fine, I really\Ndon't mind doing it.
Teachers always\Ndecide that stuff
at the beginning of the year.
And since there are\Nso many people we don't know,
it's hard to nominate someone.
Yeah, but we're talking\Nabout Ms. Kuroi here,
she picked you 'cause\Nit's gonna be less work for her.
I heard that.
Our teacher's hair\Nwas such a mess today.
I think we're going to have
another fun year with Ms. Kuroi,\Ndon't you?
Yeah, her classes\Nare always fun.
You know what they say,\Nthe teacher's the one
who's supposed to set the tone\Nfor the rest of the class.
That totally explains it.
Now I know why\Nthe two of you are so lazy.
It's because your\Nteacher is too, isn't it?
I heard that, honey.
I'm Iwasaki, hi there.
Oh, wow, that girl's\Ntotally cute.
I was in the same class\Nas her in junior high.
She doesn't talk, man.
All she does is read books.\NShe's kinda creepy.
She's not creepy,\Nshe's nice.
I'm the only one who knows\Nwhat she's really like.
Next.
Oh, I'm coming.
I have to make a good\Nimpression.
I'll be bright and cheerful.
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
I'm short like a fifth grader,
but I didn't skip any grades\Nto get here.
Just kidding!
\NShe skipped grades?
-\N-
I think Onee-chan's\Ngeekyness is rubbing off on me.
Okay, how about we figure\Nout the class duties next?
Does anybody wanna\Nvolunteer for class rep?
'Course not, who would?
Iwasaki, you were the rep\Nin junior high.
Why don't you volunteer?
Is that true, Iwasaki?\NYou wanna be class rep?
I'm sorry sir, but I'd like\Nto do something different.
Hmm, I would've liked\Nsomeone with experience.
What do you want to do?
Are you gonna work\Nin the library?
The nurse's office.
I'd like the be\Nthe class rep, sir!
She really is nice.
It's springtime, something new\Nis about to happen.
I can feel it.
A new friend,
a new life,
a new love.
With a childhood friend,\Nwith an older boy
you have a crush on, or with\Na strange transfer student.
The anticipation you feel\Nthe five seconds
before falling in love.
MK5, that's how I always\Npictured it to be.
But the reality is you're\Nstarting from scratch
with total strangers,\Nhow depressing.
Whatever,\NI'm used to it already.
You're still better off\Nthan I am.
Onee-chan!
Hey, Yu-chan,\Nhaven't see you all day.
Yeah, I know, I know,\Nnot since this morning.
This is the girl who\Nhelped me out that one day,
you know, the one I told you\Nabout.
Oh, right, awesome,\Nnice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
See, see?\NIt's just like I told you.
I knew she'd get accepted here\Nand she did.
Yeah, you're right,\Nthere she is.
But she could've picked\Na different school
even though she\Ngot accepted here.
But she didn't and now\Nshe's here, so it's okay.
Yeah, anyway, Yu-chan,\Nwhere were you guys headed?
We wanted to find\Nthe nurse's office,
'cause I'm sure I'm gonna\Nbe seeing a lot of it.
-I hear that.\N-Oh, I know,
you could show us where it is.
Sure, no problem,\NI'll show you guys the way.
Where was\Nthe nurse's office again?
I don't really know, 'cause\NI've never had to go there.
You're kidding,\Nyou've been here two years
and you still don't know\Nwhere the nurse's office is?
I can't help if I've been
unusually healthy\Nthe last two years.
You went and had your\Nphysical exams there.
Actually, I don't think I've\Never been inside the art room.
Well you are majoring\Nin music
so you probably don't\Nhave the time.
Take me for example,\NI have yet to venture
anywhere near the Judo hall.
And I just found out\Na while ago
that we have a tea room\Nhere.
Well I guess if you've gone\Nto the same school for three
years, maybe what it is,\Nis that you only go to
the places you need to go,\Nor something like that.
Hate to say it,\Nbut I don't go
to the study hall that much.
I always go to the study hall.
No way!
It's the only room quiet enough
where a girl can catch\Nup on her Zs.
I saw Yu-chan hanging out\Nwith that girl
she met during\Nthe entrance exams.
They were looking.\Nfor the nurse's office,
and she said they're both in the\Nsame class. It's like a miracle.
If you ask me, it's a miracle\Nthat I got to meet Kona-chan
and Yuki-chan here and that\Nwe all got to be friends.
Hmm, good point.
It's hard to believe\Nthis will be the last year
the four of us will be\Ntogether like this.
And Kagami was in a different\Nclass the whole time.
Thanks for reminding me,\Nbuzzkill.
The answer is\NB, the poison carrot.
This will be on the exam,\Nso make sure to remember it.
Yo, wake up, Izumi.
Potemkin!
What the heck are\Nyou dreaming about?
Sorry, teach, I don't know\Nwhat happened, I was actually
concentrating really hard\Non not falling asleep.
-Oh?\N-Yeah, ma'am, but the monster
called sleepiness\Njust kept coming.
Oh, yeah?
It sneaks up on me, I can't\Ndodge it, it's my destiny.
I appreciate your\Nhonestly and your attempt
at an explanation,\Nbut maybe this'll wake you up.
You never fall asleep\Nin class, Miyuki-san,
is there a trick to it\Nor something?
I can't say there's\Nany trick to it at all.
I really need my sleep\Nso I tend to go to bed
around 11 o'clock at the latest.
In fact, until last year,\NI'd always be in bed by 10.
No way, that's impossible,\Nshe's like a machine.
I knew this stuff was\Nimportant and I remember taking
notes in class 'cause I knew\NI'd have to study it later,
but I can't tell what any of\Nthis is
'cause I was half asleep\Nwhen I was writing it.
I can't tell either.
You know what,\Nlooking at it now,
I'm thinking how awesome is that
'cause it shows I'm trying\Nreally hard to study.
I just wish I could figure out\Nwhat the hell I wrote down.
They're equations.
Ms. Kuroi.
That's great, ma'am!
You can understand\Nmy horrible scribbling?
'Course I can, the only\Nproblem is that you
should've been dreaming\Nabout world history
'cause that's when you were\Nwriting 'em.
Okay.
Kona-chan, what are\Nyou doing up so late?
Huh?\NSo it stinks after all.
Uh-oh, I didn't know it\Nwas so late.
Ooo, I wonder if anyone else\Nis online. Oh!
You never learn, can't wait\Nto see you in class tomorrow.
\NLucky Star.
\NLucky Channel!
Hi, Luckies! This is Lucky\NChannel, the show that strives
for world peace, or so they say,
and I'm your navigator\NAkira Kogami!
And I am the assistant,\NMinoru Shiraishi.
I cannot believe we are\Nalready on episode 15!
Wait, today's our 15th episode?
That would be correct.
So you're done after\Ntoday's episode, huh?
Uh...
Bye, me.
Didn't you hear?
Producers said starting\Nwith episode 16,
I was gonna be flying\Nsolo on Lucky Channel.
Uh-huh, that's what he said,
and he even wished me good luck.
Uh, wait, can't we\Ntalk about this?
Hah, I got you, April Fools!
You totally fell for it,\Ndidn't you?
Oh, yeah, you got me,\Noh, yeah, funny.
Sayonara, today's show\Nlooked like a blast.
The performance of\NHaruhi Suzumiya could've been
your twin brother hosting it.\NHe looks so much like you.
I don't think I know\Nwhat you're talking about.
So when the hell am I gonna\Nget my own concert, huh?
Oh, I don't know.
You guys need to tell me\Nthis stuff in advance 'cause my
schedule gets filled up\Npretty fast these days, buddy!
Sure, I'll check\Non it right now.
Look, the eastern skies,\Nare burning red.
A circle, it's on,\Nthe producers said
it's okay on the next episode.
Yes, I understand.
Akira Kogami's concert\Nis happening
on the next Lucky Channel!
What, really?
Are you serious? You guys booked\Nthe arena and stuff?
They twisted a couple arms\Nand got a place, and then.
Oh, yeah, that's what\NI'm talking about!
You're my boy, Itou!
I'm really looking forward\Nto hearing you sing, Akira-sama.
I can host the show for you.
People seem to think I'm an okay\Nemcee, so don't you worry.
I'm so happy right now.
This is gonna be so freaking\Nawesome!
We'll see you guys\Nnext week!
Bye-nee!
Oh yeah, are you\Neven gonna be here next time?
\NI'm a lieutenant.
One, two, three, four...\N
One, two, three, four...\N
On the next episode\Nof "Lucky Star"...
-I'm Inari.\N-I'm Matsuri.
-I'm Miki.\N-I'm Tadao.
\NNext time, "Ring."
\NLook forward to it!
\NSenior year, Class B...
\NMs. Kuroi!
\NYeah, yeah.
Good morning, Kagami.
Oh, hey. You look like you're\Nin a good mood today.
You bet I am. I traded in my\Nold cellphone for a new one.
Good, it's about time.
The new cellphones are so cool.
You can set up a song\Nas your ringtone,
and even customize your screen.
Oh, I already tricked\Nit out with my favorites.
Heck of a ringtone\Nyou got there.
Yeah, right?
But it kind of sucks 'cause\Nyou have to pick up
before the chorus\Nstarts playing.
And you know what happens\Nif you don't answer?
It stops in the middle\Nof the song.
I never really got into it,
but okay,\Nif that's how it works.
If I had to choose,\NKagami would be an orc.
Why do I have to be\Nthe only monster?
Huh. Yes, hello?\NHiiragi speaking. Yeah, I know.
I answer the phone\Nat home that way.
Is it just me
or was she super hoppin' mad\Na couple seconds ago?
What's up with that?
How come women are able\Nto switch gears so fast?
Hmm, that reminds me\Nof what happened the other day.
Hello, Mother, I'm home.
Who is it? Miyuki?
Oh, Miyuki, you have\Na phone call. It's Konata-chan.
Did I do\Nsomething wrong or something?
\NNo, it's not you.
You see, my mother is sort\Nof an open book.
She can't conceal her anger\Nvery well.
I think she accidentally\Nkicked the corner of her desk.
Oh. Yeah, but I don't get how
any of that relates\Nto opening books.
Her personality's exactly\Nwhat you see.
You're so smart, Miyuki.
I can always count on you\Nfor answers to things.
You help me out so much,\Nyou know that?
Getting a compliment\Nfrom my mother made me so happy
that I got into the habit
of looking up the answers\Nto things.
I can't believe it, Miyuki.
You know more than I do\N.
As a result, learning\Nnew things became a joy.
I guess this means
that I did a bang-up job\Nof raising you, doesn't it?
And that's what she said.
You talk about\Nthe loopiest things.
Well, there's one thing\NI know for sure.
There's absolutely no doubt
that you are your mother's\Ndaughter, Miyuki-san.
Are we that alike?
Yep, down to the\Nlast pink hair.
Although one thing's for sure,
you really do know a lot\Nof stuff, Miyuki.
And not just the things\Nthey teach us in school.
There's so many places\Nto find answers.
That's what ultimately makes\Nlearning fun.
Blegh, sounds like\Na lot of work to me.
I think I'll pass.
I'd rather play and I'll ask\Nfor help when I get stuck.
They say selfish people\Neither come
from being the oldest child\Nor the only child.
Come to think of it, Miyuki,
you're an only child,\Naren't you?
Never mind, I guess it depends\Non the person after all.
Actually, there is some truth\Nto that.
You see, there's someone\Nat home whose behavior is,
well, slightly older sisterish.
Cleaning is such a chore.
Laundry's exhausting.
I want to order takeout.
You know, we've got two sisters
so we had to get tough fast.
Every time we sat down\Nfor dinner,
it turned into a battle\Nfor food.
Yay, it's sukiyaki.
\NEat up everyone.
\NThank you for the food.
Kona-chan was saying how
when you're cell phone\Nisn't getting reception,
it's 'cause the density\Nof the something
or other particles are high.
Wow, you don't say.
Yeah, and she says\Nwhen the battery goes dead,
it means the situation's\Nsilenced.
Boy, you kids are using\Nsome strange words these days.
Hey, come on, guys.
We have to leave some\Nfor Tsukasa, you know.
Tsukasa, you can have some\Nof mine okay?
Oh, thank you, Sis.
Come on, Kagami.
You were wolfing it down\Njust like everyone else.
Then having siblings is\Nboth good and bad.
And there's good and bad things
about being\Nan only child as well.
Like how you space out every\Nnow and then, Yuki-chan?
Huh, I space out?
Yeah, you know,\Nlike the other day.
I don't know about road apples.
I mean if you were an apple,
-how would you feel?\N-Ouch!
You okay there?
I'm afraid I was deep in thought\Nand not paying enough attention.
And I walked right\Ninto the door.
Oh, Miyuki-san.\NYou concentrate too hard.
That happens to you a lot, huh?
Yes, and it's\Nreally embarrassing.
Hold it, if you're doing\None thing
and then you start thinkin'\Nabout somethin' else
in the middle of doing it,
doesn't it mean that\Nyou lack concentration?
Wait, what'd I just say?
I don't know, Miyuki.
That sounds just like you.
I know.\NJust the other day,
I was warming up a drink\Nin the microwave and...
Oh, I forgot all about it.\NSilly me.
I'll just warm it up again.\NOh!
Oh, I'll have to do\Nit again. Oh! Not again.
Oh.
Oh, Miyuki, you poor thing.\NYou forgot again.
I'm sorry, I did.
I'll take care of it for you.
I'll bring it over when\Nit's ready, okay, hon?
Thanks, Mother, you're the best.
I forgot.
As I was saying, you are\Nyour mother's daughter.
I know, it's so embarrassing.
So, Miyuki-san, when did you\Nstart wearing glasses anyway?
Hmm, let's see.
I think maybe halfway\Nthrough elementary school?
Really? If you weren't born\Nwith that eyesight,
why'd you have to get glasses?
When I was little,
one of the things I really loved
was how my mother used\Nto read books to me in bed.
My mother always fell asleep\Nbefore I did
and I wanted to know how the\Nstory ended.
So I'd keep reading in the dark.
And that's what happened.
It's good for kids\Nto have a relationship
with their parents, like\NMiyuki does with her mom.
There's a reason why the\Nkids today seem so aloof.
If they've never\Nexperienced a parent's love,
or that kind of intimacy,\Nthey eventually end up that way.
You know,\NI can't remember the last time
I got a big hug from mom.
I wonder if that means\NI'm at risk.
Oh, not even.\NCome on, don't you remember?
You were practically attached\Nto mom until the 7th grade.
-No, I wasn't.\N-You were too.
That's why you're such\Na goody two-shoes.
Well, in my family,\Nit's the other way around.
Dad's the one who's super\Nclingy.
Maybe that's why you\Nnever really grew up.
What you think of that, shorty?
Speaking of kids, haven't there\Nbeen a lot of cases lately
where young girls get\Nkidnapped or held captive?
Why are you so fascinated\Nby stuff like that anyway?
Because I'm worried\Nabout my dad, that's why.
Wow, that didn't sound\Nscary at all.
I guess if you really wanted to,
you could blame behavior like\Nthat on games or something.
But I wish they'd stop
'cause it's gonna spoil the fun\Nfor the other users.
I wouldn't even begin to\Nknow what you're talking about,
'cause none of that stuff is\Nin any of the games I play.
Oh, I just remember that my one\Nyear anniversary's coming up.
Yeah, for what?
For my part-time job,\Nthat's what.
The guys at work want\Nto do something to celebrate.
Isn't that cool of them?
That's right, I haven't\Ncome by to see you yet.
Maybe I'll come visit you\Nwhile you're working sometime.
It'll be payback for New Year's.
You should come by.
No way. Wouldn't I be bothering\Nyou if I came by like that?
Not even.
Gettin' stared at is part\Nof the job so it's no biggie.
Oh, that's right,\Nit's a cosplay cafe.
Just let me know ahead of time
when you wanna cruise by\Nand I'll get you in,
'cause the place can get\Nkind of busy.
Okay, we will.
Excuse me, guys,\Nbut class has started.
\NLucky Star.
Oh, hey, it's us.
Yeah, we just walked out\Nof the station.
Huh? Yeah, yeah, I'll pick 'em\Nup for you, don't worry.
Sure, bye.
Did Kona-chan say it was okay?
Yeah, she said\Nit's cool to come by,
but we have to go over there
and pick up this month's "Comp"\Nand Lelouch manga for her first.
I hope finding them\Nwon't be too difficult.
Me too. She also wants\Nme to get the receipts
stamped by the cashier.
Man, talk about confusing.
Excuse me, do you mind?
I just want to take a picture.
Oh.
But I'm not Kamigishi.
I'm Hiiragi.
Hey, guy, what the hell\Nare you doing?
Hey, over here, can\NI get a shot please?
No, cut it out.
Could you please\Nsay Hiroyuki-chan for me?
Um, Hiroyuki?
We're going now.
This is the first time I've\Never been in a store like this.
It's so big, it's overwhelming.
On the phone,\Nshe said we couldn't miss it
once we got inside.
I'd get lost if I was\Nin here by myself.
But I bet Kona-chan\Nwould feel right at home.
Oh, here it is.
Okay, where the heck do\NI find a Lelouch manga?
It's not here.
I can't find it either.
Excuse me, I'm having a hard\Ntime finding the Lelouch manga.
Where do you keep it?
Oh, we have it right here.
Is this what you're looking for?
What's a Code Geass?
Typical, she could've at\Nleast given me the title
to make it easier to find.
Can I get the points for this
put on my card the next time\NI come in?
Yeah, just make sure\Nyou bring your card in
and along with this receipt.
Okay, thanks.
Thank you for shopping with us.\NPlease come again.
Now we can go visit Konata\Nat her job.
I'm really hungry, Sis.
Hang on for a few more minutes.
I'll be getting off work\Nin a bit.
How does she\Nexpect us to find it
with a map like this?
Actually, I looked up\Nthe location before I left.
According to this,\Nit's over there.
That's our Yuki-chan.
Leave it to Miyuki\Nto save the day once again.
Is this the right place?
Yes, it's on the third floor.
Welcome back, Master.
Won't you come in please?
Make yourselves comfortable.
Okay, the first hour is\Ngonna be 800 yen,
and you get free refills\Non all soft drinks.
Oh, and the games are\Nall free to play.
And the sweets are\Nall you can eat.
-I think I'll try the eel bowl.\N-We're out of eel.
Uh, then I guess\Nthe shrimp pilaf.
We're not able to do that.
Huh, then how 'bout the\Nspaghetti and meat sauce?
It takes 15 minutes to prepare.
May I?
Okay, let's do it then.
With service like that,\Nhow do they stay in business?
Attention, people.
You guys wanna order or what?
Yeah, just hang on a second.
Come on, hurry up.
If you're late,\Nthere's a penalty, penalty!
Is this how you treat\Nall your customers?
Yeah, that's kind\Nof the protocol here.
Have you made up your minds yet?
I'll have the melon soda.
Ordinary menu items don't\Ninterest me.
Huh?
I'd like to have\Nthe milk tea please.
Come on, come on,\Nwhat do you want?
Chill out, I'm still deciding.
For a brigade member,\Nyou sure are slow.
I'm not a brigade member.
You are if you're my customer.
Your brigade leader is not in\Nthe mood for any of your lip.
You're giving me a headache.
I don't know, an ice coffee,\Nwhatever.
Your brigade leader\Norders you to wait here.
Oh, brother.
It hasn't been that stinky\Nin a while.
Okay, guys, get ready 'cause\Nthe show's about to start.
Oh, wow.
That was an amazing performance.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, she's an exchange student.
And she's in 10th grade.
And she's going to art school.
It's really nice\Nto meet you guys.
My name is Patricia Martin,\Nhow do you do?
And guess what, we've also\Ngot a CD out. Check it.
You're not seriously\Ntrying to sell that, are you?
Oh, excuse me, may I\Nhave some tea please?
Absolutely,\Nwould you like it hot?
Yes, please.\NHot would be perfect.
Oh, may I please have\Na melon soda?
Melon soda coming up.
Let's see. What's in
the-we-decide-what-juice-we-mix\Ninto-this-drink drink?
Yeah, that's classified.
Protocol, baby.
Could this place be\Nany more exhausting?
Oh, no, I'm so tiny.
You'll be fine.
You'll see as you get older,\NI'm sure you'll grow taller.
Really? You think so?
Hey, Onee-chan.
Oh, hey, Yu-chan.
And then she comes along
and shatters all the hope I had.
Well, I was wondering,
how much taller have you gotten
since you started high school?
Hmm? Oh, I haven't\Nseen a difference
either vertically\Nor horizontally.
I wouldn't get my hopes up\Nif I were you.
-Huh?\N-
-\N-Oh, don't be sad.
There's a demand out there\Nfor you too.
I was wondering if either\Nof you guys
have ever been\Nto a class reunion.
Mm, no, I can't say that I have.
Yeah, I haven't either.
What's up, why you asking?
You know how you hear\Npeople saying things like,
"Oh, you haven't changed a bit."
And most of the time, it's\Nmeant to be a compliment.
But the only people
who really wanna hear something\Nlike that
are the ones who have changed\Nnormally.
If you know what I mean.
We know exactly what you mean.
Well, I know you'll are excited
about Golden Week starting up,\Nbut first,
I wanna remind you,
you got tests after the holiday,
and those entrance exams\Nthat are coming up.
The break's a good time\Nto prep for that stuff.
Also, since there's only\Na couple days
before vacation starts,
there's no way in hell I'm\Nlettin' you take any sick days.
\NI'd know that aura anywhere.
No doubt about it.
It's the legendary Girl A.
Is today's target that new book?
Or maybe a collectible.\NThink, man.
Did you forget that we're in\Nthe middle of our spring AV?
That's audio/visual, se-yo.
-Huh?\N-Not yet, leave her be.
Once her guard's down, pounce\Non her with a recommendation.
Good, now wait for her\Nto get a little closer.
Closer.
Now, go get her. Goin' in.
Welcome to the store.
These just came in today.
What up, Kagami?\NYeah, you outside?
Cool, I'm walkin' out the door\Nnow.
She was just killing\Ntime waiting for her friend.
The trick to cooking\Nany simmered dish
is to chop all your\Ningredients into random shapes.
Oh, I never knew that.
Doing it like that\Nincreases the surface area
and let's the flavor soak in.
Skim the junk off the top,
and simmer on medium\Nfor about 10 minutes.
If it cooks too long,\Nit's no good.
So just stick a toothpick in it
to make sure that it's ready.
Oh, I see.
I still can't get over the fact
that Miyuki is below\Naverage in Home Ec class.
I think I'm finally\Nstarting to understand
how you see us, Kagami.
Hiiragi-chan, if you don't mind,
would you like to meet us\Nin the library
and study for the exams\Ntogether?
Oh yeah, sure.
Meh, doesn't it suck\Nhow before exams
they cancel the after school\Nstuff
and you end up nothing to do?
It's 'cause you're\Nsupposed to be studying.
That's why there's nothing\Ngoing on.
Yeah, I understand\Nwhy it's done that way.
It's just that
now that I got all this\Nfree time after school,
it's sort of opening up a whole\Nnew world for me, you know?
With that kind of time\Non my hands,
I don't want to sit around\Nand waste my time studying.
I'm gonna get all antsy\Nand stuff.
Okay, so this little\Nstudy session you guys wanna do,
yeah, you're half the\Nreason we're doing it.
You know that right?
-I'm tired.\N-Already?
Let's take a break, huh?
Maybe you can't concentrate
because you haven't set\Na clear goal for yourself.
Don't you have any dreams\Nfor the future?
A dream, huh?
It's not really a dream,
but around this time of year,
don't you guys get bored
and wish you could win\Nthe lottery or something,
and go and live the easy life\Nsomewhere?
That would be cool.
Minegishi, do something\Nabout that, would you?
When I'm studying this hard,
I totally need something sweet\Nto eat or I'll die.
The other day,\NI baked some cookies.
And if you want,\Nafter we're done here,
I'll bring you some.
Huh, Minegishi, I didn't\Nknow you liked baking.
Not as much as that Ajiyoshi\Nboy.
Hers are way more\Ndelish than Ajiyoshi's.
Studying's a total drag.
Sis, I tried baking\Nsome madeleines.
What's wrong with you?
Well, uh...
It's not that I'm comparing\Nyou to them or anything.
But isn't it weird
how people tend to attract\Nsimilar types of friends?
I don't see how you\Ncould take all this lightly.
I mean you do realize\Nthis isn't a canker sore.
Can you believe how many\Nmedical shows
are on TV these days?
Tell me about it.
The scary thing is a lot of\Nthis stuff could really happen.
Especially to me.
Hmm. When I watch\Na show like this,
I can't stop thinkin' about\Nhow I'm gonna die someday.
And how it's gonna happen.\NThe possibilities are endless.
Could we change the subject?\NIt's starting to get depressing.
You have to stay alive,\Nyou hear, live.
Oh, hey, Sis.
Could you help me with this?
Let's see.
"Curses, like chickens,
"come home to roost"?\NI got it.
Yeah, Chris like chickens.\NSo when he comes home,
he's gonna wanna have roast\Nchicken for dinner, see?
I think. Oh, hey, Sis.
Could you tell her what\Nthe rest of this means?
Wowzers.
"When you make\Nthe contract..."
Sorry, I'm not\Ngood at stuff like this.
Oh, this totally reminds me.
The other day I was working\Nat the shrine
and I heard some tourist\Ntalking about
why the arch is called a torii.
Yeah, what'd they say?
They say birds,\Ntorii, carry the dead.
And the arch was a\Nplace for them to rest.
So they called it a tori-ee.
Bird, stay,
tori-ee, toree, tree, get it?
They know more about Japan\Nthan we do.
It would've been faster if\NI just asked Kagami about it.
\NLucky Star.
In the sea of Japan,
you can feel the chill\Nin your bones.
Where has the one I love gone?
She's over there,
swimming alone through the\Nrough waves of show business.
She's singing a song,\NMisoji Misaki.
Akira Kogami,\Nladies and gentlemen.
Shut your hole,\Nyou call this a concert?
We're over budget as it is.
This is like bringing\Nsomeone to--
We're starting.
I'm a professional, you f--
-\N-Come in.
I'm so sorry for the wait.
I have your drinks\Nright here, sir.
Great, thanks.
Whoa, hey, hold it, Sebastian.
The brown one's for me, buddy.
Damn that's good .
\NLet's see.
Where's Kentai Life Returns?
I like that one.
Huh?
Hello?
Yeah, hang on.
Wanna extend? Mm.
No, thanks, we're good.
Sure, okay, thanks.
We got to be out in five.
It's time to clean up.
Clean up, clean up.
Bye-nee!
Man, I don't wanna\Nbe a solo artist
without a single.
♪ I for- for-\Nforgot my bag. ♪
On the next episode\Nof "Lucky Star."
\NWrong.
Come on, Nagato, we're gonna\Nlose the audience like that.
You need to sound more happy.
You know, like that voice\Nyou hear on TV
on Sunday nights around 6:30.
Now try it again, go.
On the next\Nepisode of "Lucky Star."
But you didn't\Nchange any-- oh, whatever.
Next time, "Base Of The Sun."
\NLook forward to it.
Ahem. I mean,\Nrock, paper, scissors.
Da da da da da da da da.
\NSenior year, Class B...
\NMs. Kuroi!
\NYeah, yeah.
Hey, Kagami. Do you like\Nthose chocolate wafer thingies?
Sure I do. Why?
I knew it. Then these\Nare for you. Enjoy.
\NOh, thank you.
Wow!
I love these things!
I've got more if you want. Here.
\NAnd there's more
where that came from,
so dig in, guys.
Whoa, hang on. What's with you\Nand all the wafers?
\NYeah, well,
they come with toys, so I have
to buy the wafers by the case\Nin order to get the toy I want.
Oh, that figures. I should've\Nknown you'd be the type
to ignore a perfectly good\Nsnack for a cheap toy.
Hmmm. A fox.
And you're a squirrel, a dog.
Huh?
Okay, now what are\Nyou talking about?
Oh. I was just thinking\Nabout what kind of animals
we'd be is all.
Since I'm kind of\Na prankster, I'd be a fox,
and Tsukasa sort of has\Na doggy vibe.
Yu-chan's got the cute\Nrodent thing happening,
so she'd be a squirrel.
Yeah, I can see that.
I bet next you're gonna say how\NI'm like a tiger or wolf, right?
Hmm? Nah, I picture you\Nas a rabbit 'cause you're
always getting lonely and stuff.
Besides, your pig tails look\Nlike ears.
Okay, that visual is\Ntotally embarrassing.
Could we talk about\Nsomething else now?
That's so funny. I wonder\Nwhat everyone else would be.
Yui Na-san's always running\Naround, so she'd be a leopard.
And Iwasaki-san's so cool\Nand awesome,
I think she'd be a hawk.
Yuki-chan's got that\Nfluffy feeling about her.
Kind of fumo-fumo, so I\Npicture her as a sheep.
Hmmm. I hate to disagree\Nwith you,
but Miyuki-san's more of a cow\Ntype. Especially with those.
You're like a pervy\Nold man.
So we were hanging out\Nat Konata's yesterday
and found some of her old\Njournals from elementary school.
Oh! That sounds interesting.
Strange is more like it.\NI mean no offense, Konata,
but I never figured you'd\Nhang onto stuff like that.
Dad always told me\Nto keep that stuff
'cause you never know. You know?
If you think that's surprising,
check out what she wanted\Nto be when she grew up.
Our girl here wrote about how\Nshe wanted
to be something normal,\Nlike a vet or a lawyer.
They are noble professions.
Yeah, but it's the way she\Nchanged her dreams every year.
That's totally Konata.
It's weird how when I go\Nback and read my old journals,
I can tell what games\Nand manga I was into.
Okay. Games and\Nmanga. We always end up here.
It could be worse.\NYou could be one of those people
who say being a bride\Nis their dream job.
Hello? That's not a job.
That sounds\Nreally cute, though.
Yeah. Tsukasa, the truth\Nis, I was talking about you.
Huh? Really? Are you sure?
\NPositive.
You're what they call\Nan airhead.
A lot of airheads don't\Nrealize they're really airheads.
It seems you may\Nbe right about that.
\NOh, Miyuki-san.
You've just proven my point.
What? Do I have something\Non my face?
Hey, Miyuki-san,\Nhow bad's your eyesight
without your glasses?
It's way under 20/200.
Oh, is that so?\NYou know, I heard somewhere
that eating blueberries was\Nreally good for your eyes.
Oh, they are. You can also eat\Ncarrots,
which contain vitamin A.\NAnd green leafy vegetables
like spinach are good.
There's also pork,\Nwhich contains vitamin B.
And foods like liver and sesame\Nseeds, both rich in protein,
are also good things to eat\Nto help maintain good vision.
Or there's also\Nthe option of Lasik treatments,
which are popular.
\NOh.
The thing is,\NI lack the courage
to go through\Nan ordeal such as that.
Although\Nthe vision training programs
I've seen on TV sound\Nquite promising.
Wow. You sure know a lot,\Ndon't you?
Well, those are just a few\Nof the many options out there.
So, if you know about all this\Nstuff,
how come your eyesight's not\Nany better?
Oh! I guess I just never got\Naround to trying any of it.
Oh, yeah? Why not?
I'm sorry. I don't know why.
It's never too late to start,\Nright?
Why don't you try\Nthe vision training thing?
I suppose I could.
Okay, let's see. First,\Nyou close your eyes.
Then you open them quick.\NThe trick is
to keep your head still.\NThen you look to the left,
and then to the right,\Nwithout moving your head.
Miyuki-san! Your head, it\Ntotally moved when you looked!
Really? Oh, oh, dear.
How strange.\NWhoa. Easy now, girl.
My eyes are tired now\Nthan before.
I hope it didn't\Nmake your vision worse.
Hey, Kona-chan?\NWhat does "moe" mean?
Hmm. How does one\Ndefine something like that?
Uh. How?
I know you definitely\Nuse that word to express
how much you like something,
but I don't have a\Nsolid definition for it.
Hold it. How can you use a word
and not know what it means?
All I can say is that\Nthe only people
who really understand what\N"moe" means are
the hardcore-iest\Nof hardcore otaku.
Not that it matters much,\Nbut I actually think
I sort of know what you mean.
\NWe're gonna check out doggies
from around the world!\NDaffundah!
Puppies are so cute,\Naren't they?
Wouldn't it be super neat if we\Ngot a dog?
Hmm?
Whoa. Slow down, Tsukasa.
You better think about\Nwhat you're asking for.
Will you be able to\Ntake care of it?
You know, train it, walk it,\Nfeed it.
Are you still going to think\Nit's cute when it grows up?
And are you even mature\Nenough to take care
of a living being?
Yeah. You're right, sis.\NI guess it's something I need
to think about a little harder.
It's good that you know what\Nit's like to have a dog.
Oh, well, well, not really.\NI mean, what do I know
about having a dog?\NI just looked it up is all.
Oh, come on now! You said\Nyou liked this artist, right?
Just give it a shot!
Jeez, okay,\Nbut you're too close.
And you're freaking me out.
\NStaaaaaaaaaaaaare.
Staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaare.
Okay. What is it?
Oh, nothing. I was just\Nwondering how far you got.
Has a character called Osano\Nshowed up?
No, I haven't reached\Nthat level yet.
Well, go on, hurry up,\Nkeep reading.
There are so many elections
going on right now.\NThat really blows.
You think so?
What's with the gloomy\Nlook on your face, lady?
You should be studying\Nfor your college entrance exam.
Oh, ma'am, I was just\Nsaying how it sucks
to have all these elections.
The heck are you talking about?
I'm talking about how\Nthe regular shows
get shuffled around 'cause\Nof all the election coverage.
I mean, the other day,\Nthis one show got
pushed back four whole hours!
And they always interrupt\Nthe regular broadcast
with election updates! And\Nthat L-shape thing they use
makes the screen way smaller!
Hold on there, missy. That\Nawful election programming
helps you keep up on your\Ncurrent events.
There's other things besides\Nanime.
Besides, elections aren't the\Nonly things throwing programs
out of whack. Look at K-1.\NThey're always kicking shows
to the curb to get on the air.
I mean, come on, I thought\Nyou liked martial arts.
\NI've got experience,
but I really don't like\Nit that much.
\NBut even anime shows
have special programs,
don't they? My honey!
\NBut they don't run into overtime
and cause problems for\Nthe show that comes after it!
\NBut kids facing
college entrance exams\Nshouldn't worry about that!
They should study!
\NIt comes down to
a power attack after all!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Kona-chan's stuck 'cause she\Ndidn't bring an umbrella today.
You could at least watch the\Nforecast.
Maybe I should just walk\Nhome and not care if I get wet.
You know, like all the guys do.
I always wondered\Nwhy all the boys never cared
about getting wet in the rain.
'Cause they don't have to worry
about their bras showing\Nthrough.
You're so smart.
Okay, you got a point.\NBut you don't have to
broadcast it\Nto the whole school.
Ever hear of modesty?
Could either of you hook\Na girl up with an umbrella?
Tsukasa and I are both\Ngoing straight home now,
so I guess we can get\Nby sharing an umbrella.
Ah, you guys are the best.
How come you don't keep\Nan umbrella in your locker?
You know, to keep\Nyour books company.
Well, it's funny you\Nshould mention it,
'cause I did used to keep\Nan umbrella in there.
But I had to use it one time,
and then I forgot to\Nbring it back the next day.
It's not like umbrellas\Nare part of my daily routine.
With an attitude like that,\Ngo figure you'd forget.
Wait up, Suzume! I said wait!
That reminds me. Whenever\NI'm wearing rubber boots
and a raincoat,\NI always think about
how dorky I must\Nlook to everyone.
Yeah, I know.\NYou feel sorta immature
wearing stuff like that.
\NSo how come when you see it
in art and stuff,
it gives off this "moe" vibe?
Like I would know.
\NLucky star.
Oh, hi-ya, Konata. What's up?
Good morning!
Hey, Tsukasa,\Nwhat's with the sad face?
Oh, this month's\Ncell phone bill was really high,
so I got scolded for it.
You should try my method.\NI hardly ever use my cell phone,
so all I pay is the basic rate.
Oh, I see.
It's way more economical.
Okay, how is it economical\Nwhen you're paying
the basic monthly rate for\Na cellphone you hardly ever use?
That sounds like a waste\Nof money.
You really need to stop sweating\Nthe small stuff, Kagami.
Oh, a text.
"Could you please pick up some\Neggs on your way home today?"
"Don't worry, I will
"go to
"the store with sis
right after school today."
There!
Let me guess.
That was a conversation between\Nyou and your parents?
It's funny how when\Nyou're texting your parents,
you can't help but speak\Npolitely.
Yeah, I sort of get\Nwhere you're coming from,
but trust me, that'll change\Nonce you get used to it.
Mm-hmm.
How long have you had\Nyour cellphone anyway?
For about a year now.
And when do you usually\Nreplace it with a new one?
I heard you're supposed\Nto do that every two years.
They say that's when your\Nbattery starts dying anyway.
Then I'll make mine last twice,
no, I'll make it last three\Ntimes as long. I swear it!
Why are you spazzing out again?
I'm just saying I take super\Ngood care of all my stuff.
I make everything last longer.
Especially when you don't\Nuse the stuff you have.
I guess some people\Nare like that.
They splurge on all their\Nhobbies,
and they're stingy\Nwith everything else.
Sorry to bother you, sis.
May I borrow your\Nworld history textbook?
Again?\NOh, man, you are so helpless.
Here. And try not to forget\Nyour book next time, okay?
Okay.
I'll bring it back later today.
I guess your sister can be\Npretty careless sometimes, huh?
Yeah. I guess that's all\Nthe more reason
why I have to be the responsible\None in the family.
Hmmm. Yeah, but is\Nthat good for her though?
I mean, if you're always\Nthere to bail her out,
there's no reason for her\Nto act any different.
So it's because of you
that your sister's\Nthe way she is, Hiiragi.
\NHuh. She does have
a point there.
I wonder.
Hey, Hiiragi, what time is it?
I don't know.\NThe clock's right there.
Oh. There it is.
Ah! The legend of your\Nmorning temper is for reals!
Oh, come on. I dropped it\Nand a little piece broke off.
Reading manga's nice, Tsukasa,
but try to read\Na newspaper once in a while.
You'll learn a whole lot\Nabout the world around you.
Okay.\NMm-hmm.
Let's see.
Oh, reading a newspaper\Nis way too hard!
I mean, it's like,\Nwhen I read a line,
I don't know where\Nthe next one starts!
Yeah, I kind of figured you'd\Nhave a little problem with that.
Oh, hey, guy. How's it going?
Yeah? What's up?
For starters, how about you\Ncall Ms. Kobayakawa over here?
I'm a senior. Tell her\NIzumi's here to see her.
Yeah, sure. Hey, Kobayakawa!
Izumi-sempai, the senior,\Nwants to see you!
Hey, Onee-chan! What's up?
Ah, I love how they\Nget all polite and stuff
when they find out that\NI'm older than they are.
They're cute when they do that.
\NI wish I was as
tall as you, Iwasaki-san.
Huh?
I wonder why there's\Nso much of a difference.
Well, I can't be certain.
Maybe it's because I drank\Nlots of milk or something.
I get it!\NIt's because you work hard
on it every day, isn't it?
No. If only life were\Nas simple as that.
I'd love to see a little\Nbit of growing happening
somewhere else for a change.
Huh?
Hey, guys, it's raining.
So we're gonna be playing\Ndodge ball
in the gym today for PE.
I always pictured you as\Nbeing the last girl standing
on the courts, Iwasaki-san.
I think you look really tough.
If I'm playing infield,\NI end up being one
of the last ones left, too.
Maybe it's 'cause I'm small\Nand I'm hard to hit.
\NHmm. They both survive the game,
but for very different reasons.
I'd feel awful if I hit\NKobayakawa-san, though.
Darn it. It sucks they put\Nus on different teams today.
We get to be\Non the same team, though.
Iwasaki-san seems like\Nshe's really good at sports.
I bet she's ruthless out there.
It's okay. I asked to be put in\Nthe outfield so it's all good.
I'm glad.
\NIwasaki-san's
such a good person.
Ready to pound these\Nguys, Kobayakawa-san?
Mm-hmm.
And you're okay with\Nher trying to nail you?
Mm-hmm.\NYeah, I bet you are--
I mean, let's have\Na good game, okay?
Ah! Oh.
Plowed by the girl who works\Nin the nurse's office.
Are you okay?
You were pretty amazing\Nout there, Iwasaki-san.
You pop everybody you aim for,\Ndon't you?
Oh, you think so?
You've got great reflexes\Nand targeting skills.
Whatever.
What happened?
Is she upset because\NI was making a fuss over her?
Oh, no. She's just\Nembarrassed is all.
Yeah? Well I guess\Nit's okay then.
I can't really tell with her.
\NOh, wow.
She's the type who always
gets misunderstood by others.
I guess if they don't\Nknow her,
they totally get the wrong\Nimpression.
Have you gone on any cool\Ntrips since you came to Japan?
Uh-huh. I went to all\Nthe sacred places.
Sacred places?
Yeah! I paid my respects
at the three most sacred\Nplaces in Japan.
Did you go to Kamakura, Kyoto,\Nand Nara?
Oh, no. I went to Akiba\Nin Tokyo,
Nipponbashi in Osaka,
and Osu in Nagoya.
\NHuh?
And I'm going to go visit\Nall the important places
around here as well.
You mean like, Tokyo Tower\Nand Asakusa?
No, not those places.
Like, Nakano and Kichijoji.
Okay.
Ah!
Are you okay?
Yeah. I just got some\Ndust in my eye is all.
Can I see?
Are you sure you're gonna be\Nall right?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Look at them! Don't they\Nlook awesome like that?
Ugh, how can I stare\Nat my friends like that?
God, I'm such a pervert!
\NHello.
\NHi, come on in.
I'll be right back.\NI'm gonna go get some drinks.
Huh?
Hmm.
\NShe's got a lot of books.
I sure hope you guys\Nare okay with--
Agh!
Wow, Hiyori. I didn't know\Nyou were into stuff like this.
Kill me now.\NJust please, kill me now.
Hurry. Do it fast.
I think these are her newest\Nsketches.
Oh, look at how much\Nshe's improved.
You're right. She's really good.
I can't believe how much\Nthis looks like Iwasaki-san.
Yeah?
Oh! It's Takarazuka!
\NIs that supposed to be me?
Are you making a fairy tale?
Mm-hmm.
Wow. I'd like to read\Nit when you're done!
Oh, God! I have to stop\Ndrawing my friends like this.
I'm such a pervert.
Hey, Tamura-san. Would you\Nlike to go to Otome Road?
Yeah, I was thinking about\Ngoing.
What's Otome Road?\NIs it near here?
You've never heard\Nof Otome Road?
No.\NI haven't either.
Oh, Yadeyade does.
It's called Otome Road, huh?
Otome Road, or "Maiden Road"\Nis a street
on the west side of\NSunshine 60 in Ikebukuro, Tokyo.
You'll find lots of stores\Nthat specialize
in manga and anime, and shops\Nthat carry figures and stuff.
It's a gathering place for otaku
almost on the same level\Nas Akiba,
but unlike the scene in Akiba,
there's way more girl otaku\Nthan boys.
That's why they nicknamed\Nthe street Otome Road.
It's known as the street where\Nthe Fujoshi go to hang out.
Fujoshi?
It's written as "rotten girl"\Nbut read as "spoiled lady."
Rotten girl?
Yeah, now that you mention it,\Nthey are kind of rotten.
Oh!
\NAhh.
Come on,\Nit's the three second rule.
You know,\Nthe three second rule?
You got like five seconds
before the germs start hopping\Non it.
I didn't say anything.\NI'm just sitting here.
Mmm!
Ah!
No!
Not my meatball.\N
What happened\Nto the three second rule?
Okay, that rule only\Napplies in certain situations
so ease up, will you?
\NLucky Star.
Lucky Channel!\NHiya, Luckies!
Hi! We're back again\Nwith another edition
of your favorite show.
They said it couldn't be done,
but we've made it to the\N18th episode of Lucky Channel!
And all of you should\Nknow who I am by now.
Uh-huh. I'm your navigator,\NAkira Kogami! And this is--
Hi, guys!
I'm the one who's trying super\Nhard to be the best assistant
Akira-sama's ever had.\NI'm Minoru Shiraishi.
Anyway, here's the theme\Nfor today.
We're introducing\Nall the new characters
appearing on the show.
So let's get this thing\Nstarted with a big fat bang.
You feel me?
A big fat bang.
\NFor starters,
we've got Konata-san's cousin,
Miss Yutaka Kobayakawa.
Her classmates are\NMiss Minami Iwasaki,
Miss Hiyori Tamura,
and Miss Patricia Martin.
Next up,\Nwe have Kagami-san's classmates.
Miss Misao Kusakabe,
and Miss Ayano Minegishi.
The cast is filled out quite\Nnicely, don't you think?
I'm sure this stuff's old\Nnews to most of you guys.
These ladies have been a part\Nof the opening credit
since the very beginning\Nof the--
How many girls are they gonna\Nbring out
before I get my friggin' turn?\NIt's already episode 18!
Actually, you made an appearance\Nin today's episode, Akira-sama.
You looked ultra cute\Nin that raincoat
and rubber boots outfit.\NHuh?
Hey, you know, that\Nreminds me of something.
I had a chance to speak\Nto Anizawa-san
after last week's show and he\Ntold me something interesting.
He said there's one thing an\Nactor needs more than anything,
and that's presence.\N
Even though you were only\Nin the show for a split second,
when you appeared, it was like,
"Whoa. That was Akira Kogami!\NDidn't she--"
Whatever.\N
Ugh.
Hey.\NYeah, sorry.
I said, "hey."\NNo, everything's okay.
No way. Is it time to say\Ngoodbye already? Bummer!
We really wanna know what you\Nguys think about the show,
so please, please, please, keep\Nyour comments coming, okay?
You can either email us\Nor call into our radio show.
Well, bye me!\NTurn it off!
\NThanks, guys.
Texting?\NWhat? I'm sorry?
You were texting.\NNo, well, not really.
\NWho were you texting?
My, uh, parents.\NWhy?
They want me to visit.\NWhat'd you tell them?
Well, you know.\NI don't.
\NWait, no, I--
On the next episode\Nof "Lucky Star."
I'm Hiyori.\NI'm Patricia.
Patty, you like your job?\NYeah, it's awesome!
I'll bet\Nthe first-time customers
that come in to the cafe have a\Nlot more fun when you're around.
\NWell, actually,
I don't deal with first-timers.
\NOh, really?
\NI only serve
the regular customers.
You know, the ones\Nwho drop serious cash?
Yeah, that's the cafe's policy.
\NWow, that's harsh.
Next time,\N"There's Substance in 2-D."
\NLook forward to it.
\NSenior year, Class B!
\NMiss Kuroi!
\NYeah, Yeah.
\NGuess what?
I'm raising a pet dog\Nin a game I'm playing,
and the little guy's so cute\NI can't help talking to him.
\NWow!
Yeah, I know, and even\Nthough it's in a game,
I notice that I talk to\Nit like it's a real animal,
like all cutesy and stuff.
Yeah, I totally know\Nwhat you mean.
When I talk to my goldfish,\Nmy voice gets all high-pitched
and sweet sounding.
I can see talking to dogs\Nand cats that way, but a fish?
That's something only a lonely,\Ndesperate person would do.
What'd you say?
That sounds like\Nprejudice, damn you!
I see your face!\NDon't you pity me!
Talking about\Ndoggies reminds me
of this question I've had.
There's this one command I\Nheard where the trainer says,
"Chin, chin," so do you\Nguys know what that means?
Oh, oh, uh, if I\Nstart explaining it,
we could be here\Nfor quite a while.
Oh, let's just say\Nthe term is Chinese
and leave it at that, shall we?
Okay, all those who just\Nthought of something X-rated
raise your hands.
It's weird how "Gun "\Nstill really popular
with lots and lots of people.
I know, I get \Nwhen I watch it.
And come in lots
of different varieties, too.
You know,\Nlike "V," and "W," and "X."
Yep, I've been watching\Nit since the beginning
so I know 'em all by heart.
You could say it's\Nmy duty as a fan.
Okay, then, if a show called\N"Gun Serial Murders"
was on, would you watch it?
Or a show like\N"Detective Gun ,"
would you watch that?
Yes, if you really love\N"Gun ," then it's
your to\Nwatch those shows.
?
Although it's not \Nif you can't refer to it
using a letter.
All this talking about\Nmade me realize
something, I know I'm kind\Nof small for my age and
everything but I'm\Nyears older
than .
Time sure ,\Ndoesn't it?
\NCan you believe that
in two years I'm going to be\Nthe same age as ?
Isn't that crazy?
Well, you\Nknow, a really
character even in\Nthe world of "Gun ."
Same goes for .
The thing is, you can't compare\Nyour to them.
I mean, you're awfully\Nfor your age.
Shock! It would have been\Nbetter if you said that
I looked for my age.
Whatever, you're\Nstill a cutie pie.
-\N-Hmm?
Look at what the neighbors\Ngot us from their vacation.
I bet it's a valuable souvenir.
What is it, a vase?
I can't believe how\Nawesome you turned out!
You're so damn cute,\Nyou're my kind of girl.
It's too hot for hugs,\NDad, and what you just said
sounded really pervy.
Oh, it's morning.
I got so hammered last night,\NI figured I'd be passed out
for most of the day.
Oh well, I guess\NI'm still young.
Up next is\Nthe morning news for today,
Monday, July the 2nd.
Wait, what happened to Sunday?
Where'd my weekend go?
Whenever I've got an exam,\NI always make it a point to
stay up the night before to\Nstudy for it but I don't get
far 'cause I get sleepy.
I asked sis for\Nadvice and she said.
You don't like\Nscary movies, right?
What if you watch one\Nbefore you start studying
and maybe it'll keep\Nyou up for the night.
Remember last time?
You jumped into my\Nbed and wouldn't leave.
So I watched a horror movie\Nand I stayed awake all night.
Your sister always knows\Nwhat to do, doesn't she?
\NYeah, but now when it gets dark
and I hear a noise,\NI start thinking
that there's something\Nsneaking up behind me.
Now it's even harder\Nfor me to concentrate
on studying than before.
Anyway, I haven't slept\Ntoo good since then
so now I'm tired in class.
But for someone who claims\Nshe doesn't like horror movies,
you seem to watch a\Nlot of them regardless.
Believe me, if I had\Na choice, I wouldn't.
Come to think of it,\Nmy mother's the same way.
Hey, Miyuki, would you\Nlike to watch this movie
with me tonight?
I'm too scared to\Nwatch it alone.
I heard that people who\Nscare easily tend to watch lots
of movies of that sort,\Nperhaps they secretly like it.
No, Yuki-chan, you're wrong.
I really, really hate\Nhorror movies, really!
Do you understand this\Nproblem, Iwasaki-san?
I'm stuck on that one, too,\Nand I was gonna keep at it.
If I couldn't figure it out,\NI was gonna ask Miyuki-san to
help me with it.
Oh, yeah, hey, aren't\Nwe lucky that both of us
know people who are seniors?
They'll totally help\Nus if we ask 'em.
And that's what\NIwasaki-san and me were
talking about at school today.
No way,\Nshe's got too much faith in me!
\NShe's gonna find out real quick
just how harsh\Nreality really is!
Hey, Na-san, before\Nyou and Ki got married,
did you guys ever go\Nand study together?
No, why?
I always see that set up in\Ngames and stuff but if you're
with a boy you like and you\Nhave to study, there's no way
you'd be able to\Nconcentrate on homework.
And if you can't\Nconcentrate, that's when
your mind wanders and\Nyou start to fantasize.
And that's about the time\Nthe withdrawals set in.
Oneichan, could you\Nshow me how to do this part?
I'm sorta slammed right now so
why don't you ask Yui-neisan?\NGotta study, study, study.
Why you little.
Well, I went to a different\Nschool and they never
really taught us\Nanything like this, so.
Oh, no!
What a lame excuse.
I'm kinda stuck myself.
Do you understand\Nany of this stuff?
I bet you don't, Oneisan!
You know,if you already\Nknow I don't know,
don't even ask me.
Didn't you see what just\Nhappened with Yutaka?
Maybe I should just call\NMiyuki-san and ask her.
I don't wanna bother her though.
Yeah, it's kinda late.
Maybe you can call\Nher about it tomorrow?
Why don't you\Never come to me with things
like homework and stuff?
You can trust me, I'm your dad!
C'mon, man, give me a shot!
I'll fix you good!
Morning, wakey, wakey!
Even though corporal\Npunishment in the classroom's
been banned, you\Nlove hitting people.
Not that I'm\Ncomplaining or anything.
That's true but I\Ndon't hit just anybody.
If I don't pick my targets\Ncarefully, I could get
into a lot of trouble, if\Nyou know what I'm saying.
Wow, she even\Nadmits it, she's so amazing.
Banning corporal punishment,\Nwhat are they thinking?
That's it for today,\Nsee y'all tomorrow!
Hey, Miyuki-san, sorry to\Nbug you but I don't get any
of the names of these eras.
Could you show me how to\Ndo this problem, Yuki-chan?
\NWhy are they always asking her?
How come you guys never
ask me about the\Nstuff you don't get?
Wait up, Ms. Kuroi!
Hey, Izumi, what's up?
Well, I sorta had a\Nlittle question for ya.
Sure, ask me anything you want!
That's what I'm here for!
In this game I'm\Nplaying right now,
there's this rare\Nitem in it and--
woah, ma'am, what's wrong?
That's not what I had in mind.
Why's the day after a\Ntyphoon always so darn hot?
It's called typhoob-ikka but I\Nhope the mom and dad typhoons
leave the kids at\Nhome next time.
Nice word play!
Wait, what do you\Nmean by word play?
You do know that\Nwhat you just said was
a play on words, don't you?
Hmm?
Hey, sis?
I hope I'm not bothering you
but I sorta had a question.
Sure, come on in.
What'd you wanna know?
It's about what\Nhappened this morning.
Did Kona-chan say\Nsomething that was weird?
'Cause I sorta didn't\Nsee anything wrong
with what she said either.
How can you\Nbe as dense as Konata?
We watch the news together!
What the hell?
It's like you guys\Nhave bad timing
on purpose or something.
\NPitcher's eyeballing the runner
on second--
Hey, how much longer's the\Nbaseball game gonna be on?
It sorta looks like it's\Ngonna be running long again.
\NAgain? jeez!
Now I gotta reset the\Ntimer on the recorder.
Oh man, why can't they\Njust block off more time
to begin with?
You know, dad?
That's the problem\Nwith pro ball.
The players always drag\Nout every little move.
I mean, would it kill\Nanyone to pick up the pace?
'Cause if the players did that,\Nthey might actually be able
to finish a game on\Ntime for once.
\NYeah, well,
I think the pacing is\None of the things people
like about it and besides,\Nthe players need time to
concentrate, so.
Well, have you gotten used\Nto everything at school yet?
Yeah, but there's lots of\Nhomework so it's kind of hard.
You'll live.
Since you're all focusing on\Nyour college entrance exams,
I bet you guys don't have much\Nhomework to do these days.
Huh?
Okay, Konata.
What, I don't know\Nwhere she got that.
Man, is it hot out or what?
What are you doing?
Put some clothes\Non or something.
What if Yu-chan starts\Nwalking around like that?
C'mon, it's been\Nreally hot lately.
Besides, what's that thing\Npoliticians are doing?
\NCool biz?
Yeah, that!
\NNo, that's different.
What the heck are you\Ndoing down there?
Just waiting for\Nsomeone to text me back.
Don't you hate that?
While I was reading my book,\NI missed my station again.
I don't think I'll ever\Nget sick of your klutziness,
Miyuki-san, it's so cute!
I dunno about cute, sounds\Nmore like a hassle to me.
You gotta be kidding, the\Nway she gets all embarrassed
about it afterwards, hello, moe!
It's super cute when you got a\Ncouple flaws you can exploit.
Oh yeah, so when you're\Nat work, you're all,
"Oh no, I tripped, I'm\Nso terribly sorry, sir!"
or something lame like that?
Kagami, when you did\Nthat thing just now,
you looked pretty stupid.
I was just giving an example!
You're the one who brought\Nit up in the first place!
Whatever, go on, tell us\Nabout how you act all clumsy
just to score points\Nwith your customers.
No way, not me, you'd\Nthink something like that
would happen in\Nmy cafe but if it did,
the manager'd chew\Nmy butt out for it.
Really, 'cause I thought\Nyou'd be tripping on your feet
every five minutes, saying\Nit's all moe and stuff.
Uh-uh, it's true that\Nclumsy girls are cute
and there's tons of moe there
but the fact is it's only fun\Nto see that stuff happening
in games and anime.
If your always breakin'\Nstuff in real life,
it'd be irritating.
You otaku types are really\Nharsh, for geeks that is.
So if we have\Na contestant with a perfect
score today, TV will\Nbe giving one lucky viewer
a month-long trip\Nacross the tundra.
On variety shows and\Nquiz shows on TV,
you see 'em giving out\Nall kinds of prizes.
You know, like trips\Nand lots of cash.
Maybe they get more contestants\Nwhen they do it that way.
I bet their ratings go up\Na lot when they get someone
really popular to appear\Non the show, huh, sis?
I dunno, I guess so.
Ooh, here's a thought.
What if these shows let the\Nwhole audience participate
and gave them\Nthe prizes instead?
Don't you think that\Nwould make their ratings
go up even more?
Maybe but I don't think\Na TV game show would be
that straight forward.
Good mornin', ladies.
\NHey, you!
Anyway, I was playin'\Nthis game yesterday
and I got to thinking.
Do either of you know who the\Nschool idol at our school is?
Okay, what the heck's\Na school idol anyway?
Is it like\Na Miss Ryouou or something?
Yeah, I guess that's sorta\Nwhat I'm talkin' about.
But if it's anything like how\Nit's supposed to be in a game,
you get to have\Ngroupies and stuff.
Oh, man, was that a\Ngrueling day or what?
Whew, that feels good!
Wait, I gotta wake up\Nearly tomorrow.
It's better I stay off the\Ncomputer and just hit the sack.
I don't wanna be late for class.
I can't believe\NI'm making sleep a priority!
Hell, when I was\Nstill in school,
I was too busy\Nhaving fun to sleep.
I'm getting old.
\N"Lucky Star."
Uh, Tamura-san, you've\Nbeen making all those faces.
Are you okay?
Yeah, you know how when you\Ndraw, you make the same faces
as the characters\Nyou're drawing?
Yeah, I get it, you were\Ndrawing something, huh?
I didn't know you drew manga,\NTamura-san, that's cool.
Yeah, well, it's\Nonly doujin, so.
What kind of stories\Ndo you like to draw?
Well, just your\Ntypical four panel stuff.
And some romance-y\Ntype manga between
my favorite characters, too.
\NTough question.
I bought this lottery\Nticket the other day
and I won 3,000 yen with it.
So there I was\Nthinking how awesome
the rest of my day's gonna be.
Woah, you're so lucky!
But on the way to school, my\Nbike got a flat and my lunch
exploded all over the sidewalk\Nso I used some of the money
to fix the flat and the\Nrest to buy some lunch
from a convenience store.
And that's pretty much\Nall the money I won.
They say that truth is\Nstranger than fiction, I guess.
Whatever.
I guess in the end it'll\Nmake a good story for a manga
someday so it's all good.
\NShe's so tough.
An artists' drawing\Nhand is her life.
I'd give my life to save it.
\NShe's really tough.
Wow, you're super\Ntalented, Tamura-san!
I don't know what's\Ngoing on with me.
That drawing's\Npretty darn awful.
Oh, but here's a little\Nsomething I just finished
that I think rocks super hard.
Whatever, I shouldn't\Nexpect most people to get
where an artist is coming\Nfrom or pick up on all
the subtle details in the lines.
I should know better than that.
Holy crap, I forgot it!
What happened, are you okay?
Oh, it's my favorite\Nmechanical pencil.
I was drawing yesterday and I\Nleft it home back on my desk.
Wanna borrow mine?
No, man, it's gotta be her,\NI'm used to the way she feels.
The way she just flows\Nacross the page, I--
Yeah, you're right, mechanical\Npencils are all the same.
Uh-huh, yes they are.
Yeah, I knew you guys\Nwould react like that.
I totally knew\Nthat, I knew that.
The sucky-ist thing about\Nit's that I got totally lost
in there, I couldn't get\Nout for three hours.
Is anything wrong, Tamura-san?
How embarrassing!
What are they thinking\Ndressing like that in public?
\NIs it the coat?
\NWow, it's summer
and they're dressed like that.
They must be hot.
This kind of pain's reserved
for the ones who know about it.
Hang on a second, I gotta\Nsend these to someone.
\NWelcome, ladies.
Wow, it's super crowded.
I'll go put my name\Non the sheet.
It was fun, 'cause oneichan\Nand me stayed up late again
playing a video game.
Suzaka-sama,\NSuzaka-sama, part of three?
Oh, hey, that's us.
But I didn't hear\Nthem call your name.
That was someone else's.
Any time I have to put\Nmy name on a waiting list,
I write down the name of one\Nof my favorite characters.
It kinda makes me feel\Na little closer to 'em.
Know what I'm saying?
Awesome, you can find\Nmy people everywhere.
Oh, thanks a lot!
If there's one\Nthing I'd wish for,
I'd wish I could be as\Nslender and tall as you are.
I think that'd be so cool.
I want you to know, Minami-chan,
that I admire you so\Nvery much and I--
Yutaka.
Well, I'm sure you're not done\Ngrowing yet so don't worry.
You never can tell.
Perhaps you'll even be\Ntaller than me someday.
You really think so?
Minami-chan.
Minami-chan.
Minami-chan!
Woah, hold it, stop!
That totally goes against\Nthe laws of nature
and that last shot\Nis so wrong it's insane
and I need to calm down!
Are you feeling okay,\NTamura-san?
You're looking really pale,\Nwanna go to the nurse's?
I was up all\Nnight drawing my brains out,
trying to make the deadline\Nfor this contest I'm in,
and even though\NI didn't get any sleep,
I still made it to\Nthe courier's in time.
It's okay, when I work\Nreally hard on something,
I feel all shiny inside,
like I'm dissolving into\Nlittle tiny blobs of light.
\NShe's really super tough.
Oh, Tamura-san!
What does "yaoi" mean?
That depends on\Nwhich one you mean.
\N"Lucky Star."
\N"Lucky Channel"!
Hiya, luckies!
Are you guys ready for the\N19th episode of "Lucky Channel"?
We're almost at the\Nend of the season.
Can you guys believe it?
I'm Akira Kogami, your guide!
And I'm her assistant,\NMinoru Shiraishi.
I hope everyone's\Nhaving a good day today.
Wow, you look like you're\Nin a good mood, Akira-sama!
You must have done\Nsomething fun last night.
I wonder what it could've been.
Go on, take a guess!
Well, I think I'll\Npass, I just ate.
Man, this TV gig's really\Ngetting on my nerves these days.
I'm tellin' ya, after 19\Nepisodes, I'm startin' to feel
like I need a vacation,\Ndo some unwinding.
Maybe soak in a hot spring.
I'd be nice if I can win\Nsomething like that trip they
were talking about in\Nthe main segment today.
Hang on, if you want\Nto win a trip like that,
you're gonna have to become a\Ncontestant on that quiz show
that was playing\Nin the background.
Vacations are cool, aren't they?
I'd like to go on one!
Traveling through foreign lands.
They say it's good for the\Nsoul, don't ya know?
Are you saying\Nyou like to travel?
I'll say I do, I love it!
Traveling's the best\Nand I should know,
'cause I've done a lot of it!
I climbed to the top of Mount\NTakao and I went to Jogashima.
I'm what you might call\Nthe outdoorsy type.
Huh, so your outdoorsy.
Nothing calms your\Njangling nerves like
a walk in the woods surrounded\Nby Mother Nature's splendor.
It's the best in the world!
Sure, Mother Nature, walking\Nin the woods while you're
jangling your nerves, sounds\Nlike a real blast, man.
Yeah, doesn't it?
Leaving all the noise\Nof the city behind,
letting nature take\Nyou in her hands,
soothing your mind and body.
Mm-mm-mm, yeah, that Mother\NNature sure does sound hot.
I know, isn't she awesome?
You wanna go for a\Nwalk in the woods?
Are you serious, can I go?
If you're serious, I'll totally\Ngo, I'll go right now, yes!
Then you're going on\NMinoru's Mother Nature Tour.
Have fun.
They've got everything you want.
So, where am I going\Non tour exactly?
Fuji.
Huh, oh.
Well I've already climbed\Na mountain before so, uh--
You're not\Ngoing up to the mountain.
I want you to go\Nup to Fuji Forest.
Oh, I get it, the forest, okay.
Fuji Forest.
Me, seriously?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so once I\Nget to the forest,
is there anything in\Nparticular I should be--
Go and bring me back some water.
Water?
Yeah, the famous Fuji water!
And I want it straight\Nfrom the source.
Are you kidding?
You can just buy a bottle\Nof it at the store!
I like my water fresh!
I'm not going alone,\Nam I, am I, am I?
Someone's coming with me, right?
It's okay, you'll be fine.
The director and producer\Nhave agreed to sacrifice
themselves along with\Nyou, isn't that nice?
\NLet's the lady her water!
Don't get yourselves\Nkilled out there.
Oh no, is that it?
I guess it is, oh well.
Just make sure you\Nguys tune in next time,
'cause "Lucky Channel's" gonna\Nhave a super special guest
coming by the studio!
See you guys later, okay?
Bye-ni!
Wasn't there an easier\Nway to get rid of him?
I mean, we could've\Njust shot him out of a--
On the next episode\Nof "Lucky Star"...
I'm Nanako!
And I'm Yui-chan!
\NI don't know if you're like me,
but right before summer starts
don't you get all excited\Nabout it, sure you do!
But then before you know\Nit, the summer's over
and nothing exciting's\Nhappened to you.
\NHmm, I guess.
What's so special\Nabout summer anyway?
Yeah, well, it's\Nnot like you're going to find
true love with anyone\Nyou meet during summer
so whatever, right?
\NHmm, yeah, I wouldn't know.
\NWho cares, we're still young!
Let's get out there\Nand get some!
\NYeah, wait, what?
No comment.
Next time,\N"Ways to Spend Summer."
\NI'm gonna get me some!
\NSenior year, Class B!
\NMiss Kuroi!
\NYeah, yeah.
Good morning, guys, what's up?
Hey, you.
Good morning.
Wow, you remembered to\Nwear your winter uniform.
Yeah, who'd you\Nthink I am, Tsukasa?
Ahh?
But it's still so darn hot out.
I wish we could stay in our\Nsummer uniforms a little longer.
I wish they'd let us\Npick when to switch
'cause it's still cold\Nwhen they make us
change back to our\Nsummer uniforms.
Yeah.
I think the point of it is to
get us to change gears mentally.
Otherwise there'd be nothing\Nbut slackers like you guys.
So have you guys\Nheard the stories about
how parents are\Nchecking their daughters'
cell phones and computers\Nfor sketchy emails?
Right, I've heard about\Nthat happening.
Does your dad check\Nup on you that way?
Hmmm.
I doubt he'd do\Nanything like that.
Yeah, I guess not.
Your dad loves you\Nso much I bet
he'd never do\Nanything to upset you.
Hmm, yeah, of\Ncourse he does, but
don't forget, my dad\Nuses a computer, too.
And he knows how\Nembarrassing it is when
someone's been\Npeeking in to his D: drive.
His D-- forget it.
Man, this summer\Nwas all filled up with
taking classes and\Nhomework and stuff.
The fireworks and Ariake\Nwere the only fun I had.
So you went to\NComiket after all?
Comiket?
Yeah, you know it!
That's the reason why\Nmy wallet's all sad now.
Whenever you go,\Nyou hemorrhage cash.
How much did\Nyou spend this time?
If issues cost\N1,000 yen each, then...
somewhere around\N40,000 to 50,000 yen.
What the?
You know, you've got really\Nwarped ideas about money.
I hear what you're\Nsayin' but there's a thing
in this world called\Nfair market value.
Anything self-published\Nis bound to be expensive.
I'm not not talking about that!
I'm talking about how you can\Neven spend that kinda money!
What's up\Nwith the weather?
It's September but\Nit's still so hot out.
Yeah, you're right, it is.
And it feels especially\Nhot this year doesn't it?
Global warming is\Non everybody's mind.
Yu-chan gets heat\Nstroke real easy
so she usually goes and\Nhangs out in the living room
or wherever we\Ngot the AC crankin'.
Yeah, Tsukasa does\Nthe exact same thing,
but only because she's lazy.
Ahh!
You know, sometimes me and\Ndad join her for a snooze.
And we end up lying on the floor
lookin' like the kanji\Nfor the word "small."
Wait, you mean you guys\Nlook like the kanji for "river"?
No, 'cause dad always plops
himself down\Nbetween us like this.
That figures, looks\Nlike Yutaka-chan's
gotten used to\Nliving at your place.
Yoo-hoo, I'm here\Nto hang out again!
What's up, Yutaka?
Doin' good?
Oh, hey, oneichan.
Hello, what's your name?
This is my friend,\NMinami Iwasaki.
Right on, you're\NMinami-chan, huh?
Yutaka's told me all about you!
Oneichan!
\NKnowing these two share
the same DNA makes\Nme a little... envious.
Hmm?
Wow, I guess all those\Nrumors I heard about
how pretty you are\Naren't rumors after all.
You're a little cutie pie, girl.
Want something to drink?
Yeah, beer!
But you can't,\Nyou drove over here.
No, I'm just kidding.\NBarley tea please.
Of course, one sister\Nabsorbs the traits of the other.
Absorbs.
Woah, it's Yasai Mosai!
Do you know what I can\Ndo to stay awake longer?
I get so sleepy when it's night.
Instead of forcing\Nyourself to stay up late,
how about getting to bed\Nearly and waking up early?
You'd feel better.
Good idea, sis, I'll try it out.
I'll wake up early\Ntomorrow and do my best.
How come I woke up the\Nsame time I always do?
I think I remember\Nturning something off.
Even if I get up\Nearly I just end up
falling right back to\Nsleep again out of habit.
You have to want\Nto wake up early.
Maybe it's better\Nif I just tried harder
to stay up late\Nand kept studying.
I seriously doubt you're\Ngonna get a whole lot done
if you're constantly rubbing\Nsleep out of your eyes.
I got it, everyone else\Ngets up early around here,
maybe you could ask\Nmom to wake you up.
How 'bout it Mom?
Okay, I'll make sure to\Nwake you up tomorrow morning.
This is totally gonna\Nwork and it's
all thanks to my\Nsuper smart sis.
Mom, you were\Nsupposed to wake me up!
I did wake you\Nup, you even answered me.
\NWait, I did?
\NDon't you remember?
\NOooh.
Huh, oh no, Konata\Nforgot to take her lunch.
Ah, thank you.
It's kinda weird\Nwalking through the halls
of the senior class when\Nyou're just a freshman.
It feels like\Neverybody's watching me.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Uh-huh, I bet everybody\Nwas checkin' Yui-chan out.
-I mean, just look at her.\N-Huh?
It doesn't matter if it's
the senior's hall\Nor the freshman's.
If you're someplace\Nyou've never been before,
you get this weird\Nvibe, kinda like
you're the center\Nof attention or somethin'.
I'm gonna stand out no matter\Nwhat 'cause I'm so short,
but I totally feel the pressure
when a bunch\Nof seniors are staring.
You know\Nwhat, I always like it
when I get that kinda attention.
Really? You're lucky.
Yeah, but nobody blinks an eye
when I go walkin' through\Nthe freshman halls.
They don't even realize\NI'm older than they are.
Hi, Patty-chan.
Oh, hey, guys, what's up?
Are you headin' off\Nto work right now?
You know it.
I signed on for way too\Nmany shifts this week.
Are you guys still working\Ntogether at the cafe?
Yep, believe it or not, we're
startin' to get pretty popular.
Yeah, the "A" boys get\Nall moe-moe for us.
Hmm, what the heck's an "A" boy?
It's what you call\Nboys who look like
they belong in Hakuba,\Nyou know the type.
Although Narimiya-kun wasn't who\NI had in mind for that part.
That girl has definitely\Ngotten used to Japan.
Oh come on, because of that?
Woah, I just had\Na really cool idea!
I think I'll finish my bath\Nfirst, then I'll sketch it up.
Uh.
Wait, what was it?
This always happens when\NI don't jot down my ideas
right away,\Nand it was so funny!
What a day, what\Na day. I'm so tired.
That sounds\Nlike it could be funny.
I'll sketch it out when\NI get up in the morning.
It's so funny!
Oh, this sucks.
I wish I wrote it down\Ninstead of being so lazy.
It was such a good idea, too.
What was it?
Ha!
Ah! I woke up this\Ntime, but I still forgot.
Why can't I remember my dreams?
It was such an awesome idea.
\N"Lucky Star."
Okay, everybody, I'm\Nleaving it up to you guys
to figure out who's\Nstaying with who.
We're going to\NKyoto and Nara, so I want
you guys to research\Nall the cool places.
But isn't the\Nbus gonna be stopping
at all the cool places anyway?
Nah, the\Nbus is gonna be stopping
at all the typical\Ntouristy spots. Dream on.
\NAnd there goes my comeback.
Woah!
Iris crashed through here.
About 1,300 years ago, Nara\Nwas the capital of Japan.
But then, in the year\N710, the capital was
relocated to Heijo-kyo.
So please sit back,\Nrelax, and enjoy the ride
as I Nara-row down\NNara's history for you.
"Nara-row down Nara"!
\NIs that supposed to be funny?
Thanks for waiting.
Hmm, if this dude's\Nthe main one,
then the little ones around\Nhim are all the options.
You ever hear of\Ndivine punishment?
Aw.
It's really sticky.
Ew, I'm all stinky now, too.
Come on girl, cookie.
Keep it up, shorty.
Please to snap-snap, okay?
Oh, what?
I bet he wants you to take a
picture of him and his buddies.
Oh, uh, okay, uh,
click-click, okay?
Here's where you find out
just how good a person studies.
Yeah, look who's talkin'.
Um, hey sis, do you know
how people from\NIndia say cheese?
Huh, cheese in Hindi.
Uh,
cheese in Hindi?
Ah ha, we're not so\Nsmart after all, are we?
Isn't English understood by the
majority of the\Npopulation in India?
That's right, if you say cheese,
they'll know what\Nyou're talking about.
Okay, say cheese, everyone.
I heard that\Nwhenever there's a field trip
it's guaranteed that people\Nare gonna start hookin' up.
That's probably why these things
are so popular with everyone.
Hmm, perhaps the fact that\Nwe're off campus together
creates an atmosphere where we
can feel more open\Nto such things.
\NThey think, "It's now or never."
It's kind of\Nembarrassing, but if I don't
have my pillow, it's hard\Nfor me to get to sleep.
It's kind of\Nembarrassing, but if I don't
have my clock, it's hard\Nfor me to get to sleep.
It's kind of\Nembarrassing, but if I don't
fire this bad boy up\Nat least once a day,
I can't get to sleep at night.
Okay, everyone,\Nwe'll be arriving
at Kiyomizu Temple\Nany minute now.
Here's something you\Nmight find interesting,
the hill leading up to the\Ntemple is called Sannen-zaka.
And if you trip and fall here,
it's said you'll die in\Nthree years time.
The Sannen-zaka becomes\Nthe Zannen-zaka, get it?
-\N-
\NWhat if you die laughing?
Okay, people, we're\Ngonna split up
into groups and go look around.
Have fun, but be\Ncareful of the traffic.
We're gonna meet\Nup at 12:30 in front of
Chionin Temple, so make\Nsure you're on time.
Or be late and when we get back
you'll have a 20 page\Nreport waiting for you.
\NI don't think we should.
Hey, come on guys,\Nlet's give it a shot.
I wonder if this is as\Nheavy as Dragon Slayer.
\NWoah!
\NIt's so high up.
They say do it like your\Nwilling to jump off the
Kiyomizu stage, so\Ndoes that mean
that you shouldn't worry\Nabout the consequences?
'Cause if you really jumped\Noff this thing you'd die.
Kagami, you're\Nway too realistic.
\NOh look, it's a god of romance.
\NApparently this spot is
famous for bringing\Nlovers together.
\NYeah, I can see why.
Look, they're\Nselling love fortunes!
Hey, let's all pick one.
\NYeah, come on, let's do it.
Darn it, I can't see\Nanything through the wrapper.
I think they do that on purpose.
This one!
Yes, a great blessing!
Good for you, Kona-chan,\Nthat's awesome.
Oh, mine just says fortunate.
A fortunate fortune's\Ngood enough.
I wonder what mine's gonna be.
What the heck is\Na half blessing?
Maybe it means that\Nyou're half-blessed.
Or maybe it means\Nyou're half-cursed.
Nobody takes these love\Nfortunes seriously anyway.
\NOh, how cute!
Ah, you picked a good one.
I don't know, Kagami,\Nthat's more your style.
I don't know what\Nyou're talking about.
Well, I guess I will\Nbuy this little guy.
\NDon't forget this, nom-nom-nom.
I'm not buying that.
\NHow about this flavor?
No!
Watch out, you're gonna trip.
\NHm.
This one\Nsays, "Konata's my wife."
'Kay, if y'all are\Nready, we'll get going.
And when we get back to the\Nhotel, we can all have lunch.
Buckle up guys, we're off.
Ready when you are.
And, I heard Koizumi's\Nsong was sung the way IZAM--
ah, hey, Teach,\Nsomeone's chasing us!
\NWhat?
This is just like what\Nhappened to me in Hokkaido!
Hey, sing "Maetel" for me!
That idiot's gonna give\Nme 50 pages for this.
Hey, driver, could you please\Nstop the bus for a second?
Later.
-Hmm?\N-
\NYeah, right, hurry up.
\NHow come Kinkaku temple is gold,
but Ginkaku temple isn't silver?
Apparently they wanted\Nit to be mentioned
right along with\NKinkaku, so they
named it "Gin"\Nto complement "Kin."
It was never actually meant\Nto be a silver temple.
I wonder if it's\Nanything like how
they got Ruby and\NSapphire Pokemon.
\NDidn't she hear me?
Nice shot.
I forgot to tell you our\Nshrine was in the news.
Can you believe we\Nonly have one day left?
And it's our day off, so\Nwe're gonna have lots of fun.
Get ready, 'cause the real\Nfield trip begins tomorrow!
We're off to the Holy Land!
\NYeah.
Huh?
\NYour note said in front of
the hotel so I\Nfigured this was okay.
\NI, I hope you
weren't waiting too long.
So, what'd you\Nwant to talk to me about?
Well, I, I don't know\Nhow to say this,
but I...
I was wondering if I\Ncould have that doll.
You want a doll?
Yeah, you know, it's\Nthe one that you bought
back at that shop\Nin Kiyomizu temple.
The little Yatsuhashi doll.
\NYatsuhashi-kun?
Right, that's him!
I'd love that little guy\Nand I really want one but--
but I was afraid of\Nwhat the guys would say
if they saw me buy it,\Nso can I have yours?
Please!
Oh, sure.
Thanks a lot, Hiiragi!\NI owe you one, man, ha-ha!
Don't tell anyone\Nabout this, 'kay?
Later.
It won't open.
When the steam inside the bowl
cools down it creates a vacuum.
You just give the edge of\Nthe lid a little squeeze
to let some air in and\Nvoila, the lid comes off.
Oh.
Okay.
Wha!
I'm sorry!
Uh-huh, she's showin' off again.
I figured out the\Ndirections to get there.
And you're sure it's okay to go?
Oh, yeah, besides, we're just
looking at the building\Nfrom the street.
I don't see why we have to go
to all this trouble just\N'cause we're in Kyoto.
Tisk, tisk, tisk.
You still don't get the\Nadventur-ious ways of the otaku.
And I don't ever wanna get it.
There's nothing even here.
That's a good thing, 'cause they
need to concentrate\Non their work.
Their building looks\Npretty normal.
It's perfect 'cause they keep
their focus on a\Nsmall number of titles.
Did you have to come all the
way to Kyoto to buy that stuff?
No, that's embarrassing!
Come on, it'll be\Nan awesome memory of today.
Yeah sis, I\Nwant a picture with you.
\NShe's right, it'll be fun.
This is cool 'cause\Nwe got it in Kyoto.
But there's nothing\NKyoto about it.
Yeah,\Nwe made it back safe and sound,
pretty fast too.
Tsukasa went right\Nto sleep though.
\NI thought you'd be in bed too.
Ya know, sulking or something.
What makes you think I've\Ngot anything to sulk about?
Did you put that picture\Nwe took anywhere special?
\NNo, it's totally embarrassing.
Totally embarrassing.
I worked my butt off this week,
and now that the\Nclass field trip's over
I got time to do some relaxing.
I'll just fire up my\Ncomputer and spend
the weekend playin'\Ngames 'til my eyes bleed.
\N"Lucky Star."
\N"Lucky Channel"!
Hiya, Luckies!\N"Lucky Channel's" filling
up your lives with\Nanother episode!
And I'm your\Nnavigator, Akira Kogami.
And I'm her assistant,\NDaisuke Ono, at your service.
Can you believe it's\Nour 21st episode?
That's true, we're getting\Nclose to the final episode.
So without further ado,\Nour segment today is called
"This Week's Maggare."
Ugh! Is that...?
I brought back your water.
Sniff, sniff.
Blah!
What the hell is this?
It's warm, I'm not\Ndrinking that piss!
I'd rather get something\Nfrom a vending machine.
Ahhh!
Do not mess with me!
Come here, you rotten--\NI've been takin'
your crap for too long! No more!
You think everything's\Nabout you, don't ya?
\NMi-- Minoru!
Well, today it's my turn, missy!
You got any idea what it's\Nlike for me workin' part-time
in CoCo Ichi, then coming\Nhere to do this thing?
Hell, least I make more there\Nthan I do as a voice actor.
I've been workin' there so\Nlong they wanna promote me.
Before I come here to kiss\Nyour ass, I'm fryin' cutlets.
Well, maybe that's\Nwhat you should
be doing instead of acting.
You son of a-- all right,\NOno, get out of my chair!
That's my spot and I\Nwant it back right now.
I'm sorry, didn't\Nanyone tell you?
The producer and director\Nsaid you were out.
Ahh!
Those guys didn't\Neven give me a chance.
Well, I'll show them,\NI'm a late bloomer!
I bet I could turn into a\Nstar if I wanted!
You think you could, huh?\NSomeone like you?
Wha, how dare you mock me.
I don't have to take this crap.
Not from and\Nnot from !
-\N-Fine, I quit.
I'm quitting this desk!
Ahh!
-"Luck Channel" my ass!\N-
Get the hell off of me!
What, you see\Nsomething that you like?
You like that "Misoji Misaki"\Njunk? You think it's funny?
Oh, I'm gonna be 30 soon, man.
Yeah, take it.
I see you standing there.
Come here you!
\NWelcome to Idaho!
On the next\Nepisode of "Lucky Star"...
\NAkira Kogami here!
\NDaisuke Ono here.
Okay,\Nenough with the animal talk.
\NOh, those were animals?
\NNext time, "The Yonder Here."
I can cross\Nthe finish line, right?
\NRamen set!
\NSenior year, Class B!
\NMiss Kuroi!
\NYeah, yeah.
\NThanks for that awesome meal.
You got it, I should take
you guys out more often.
That was really, real good.
Yeah, I know.
I get happy inside when the eggs
are yummy like that.
-Ah!\N-Huh?
Gas is two yen more today\Nthan it was yesterday.
I should have filled up\Nwhen I had the chance.
Why do\Npeople who are generous
with their money care about gas\Nprices going up a yen or two?
So, you know that\Nbook I let you borrow
the other day?
I heard they're turning\Nit into a game now.
What do you think about that?
Geez, Kagami, that's old news.
I went and pre-ordered\Nthe limited edition
the second they announced it.
Then I bought the box\Nset of the anime
and a bunch of\Nother related stuff.
Wow, you got\Nmore hooked than me.
If someone recommends something,
the person they recommend it to
usually becomes a\Nbigger fan than
the person doing\Nthe recommending.
That's how Yui-neisan\Nbought her car.
No way.
Yup, right after I\Nloaned her a manga
with a car racing theme.
When I found out,\NI was like, "Whoa."
Having a hobby can\Nbe a scary thing.
I guess last night\Nmakes three in a row, huh?
Yeah, talk about\Na miracle, right?
If they keep up\Nthis winning streak--
What's she talking about?
I think she's talking\Nabout professional baseball.
Apparently she's a fan.
And speaking of baseball,
I seem recall that the\Nfamous poet, Shiki Masaoka,
was quite fond of it.
In fact, I heard he played\Non the team as catcher
until tuberculosis\Nforced him to stop.
He loved the game\Nso much he took
his childhood\Nnickname of Noboru
and changed it to "No-boru"\Nwhich means "no ball."
Anyway, you said\NJapan Series just now
and I realized something.
In Major League Baseball,
don't they call the winning\Nteam world champions?
Yeah, well that's\Nsomething that only applies
to North American teams.
I mean, if they wanna start\Ntalking world anything,
they should come\Nover here and beat
our team sometime, you know.
She's really into\Nbaseball, isn't she?
It was totally stinky.
It was, wasn't it?
Oh, hey, I was looking\Nall over for you guys.
Hey, Konata.
Can either of you show me how
to do this problem?
I can't believe you're\Nasking about your studies.
Sure you don't\Nwanna just copy it?
You know, looking\Nat these problems,
some of them\Nlook very difficult.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, that's 'cause they're
for this quiz game I'm\Nplaying at the arcade.
I'm not too good at\Nfiguring out basic
academic questions.
Oh, boy, here we go again.
Maybe you should\Ntry studying some time.
Entrance exams are\Nright around the corner.
This is the way I am\Nwhen I'm at school,
but at the arcade\Nthey call me a sage.
Well then, go enroll yourself
in that whatever\Nacademy game of yours.
I wish I got more\Nsleep last night.
Playing games all night, huh?
Hey, Miyuki-san,\Nis it true that
you always go to sleep by 11:00?
Yes.
That's way too early.
Whoa!
Oh, I get it.
That's what flashed\Nin my head when
I was looking at Miyuki-san,
but you get lots of sleep\Nand you're still teeny-tiny.
Oh, can you believe\Nshe said that to me?
Like I needed that.
Hello, is this the\NIwasaki residence?
Sorry to call so late,
my name's Yutaka Kobayakawa.
I'd like to speak\Nwith Minami-chan.
Oh, she's in bed already?
Does she always\Ngo to sleep this early?
♪ Pittan ♪
♪ La, la, mojipittan. ♪
Okay, that sounds like\Na happy little song.
\NOh, yeah, absolutely.
No, it's okay.
Uh-huh,
right, I'll make sure my\Nfather knows about it.
I'll tell him right after
the ground-breaking\Nceremony, okay?
Yes, right after.
Oh, no, it's nothing\Nlike that, really.
Besides, I'm not even\Nold enough yet,
so there's no way he'd let me.
Well, that's not how it is,
but thanks for saying so.
Okay, I'll let my dad know.
Okay, bye.
-You're funny.\N-Hmm?
They can't see those\Ngestures you're making.
I know, I know, I can't help it.
So, what?
Whenever I'm on the\Nphone talking to someone,
I have to stop playing my game
'cause I can't concentrate\Non the conversation.
But then my other hand\Nstarts getting lonely
'cause it's got nothing to do.
\NYeah, I know what you mean.
Anyway, I was on\Nthe phone the other day,
cleaning the floor with\None of those roller thingys
that picks up lint and stuff,
and I just kept\Nrolling and rolling.
And isn't it weird how\Nif you're doing something
like that or if\Nyou're doodling,
you just keep doing\Nit over and over?
\NYeah, I guess so.
But the second you\Nget off the phone,
you lose your\Nmotivation to keep cleaning.
And then you look around\Nand you get all sad,
'cause the floor's only\Nclean where you were sitting
and rollering.
You could just keep rollering.
My passion to keep cleaning\Nends with the conversation.
So you just give up.
That guy's super\Nstinky, isn't he?
It's fine once in a while but--
Ha, ha, look, it's a pocky,
get it?
Come on, we used\Nto do that back
in elementary school.
Seriously, that's a little\Nkid thing you're doing there.
Ah, cute.
Anyway, do you guys\Nremember some of the stuff
you used to do\Nwhen you were young?
Like when you'd stir up\Nyour yogurt and yell,
"Bread factory."
"Bread factory"?
-Yeah, didn't you?\N-Hm-mmm.
So, yeah,\N"bread factory," huh?
Go on, say it,
come on, don't be shy.
Shut up, okay!
You know that game you\Nborrowed a while ago?
I need it back\N'cause someone else
wants to play it now.
Is that someone someone\NShorty McBlue-Hair?
Yup, actually, I loaned\Na couple games to her too.
I should probably\Nget those back.
You're something else,\NHiiragi, you know that?
What do you mean?
I think it's cool you\Nremember that stuff.
The other day, I found\Nsome games I borrowed
from someone, but\Nnow I can't remember
who it was.
\NYou're kidding.
And there's a couple\Nof games I loaned out
but I can't remember\Nwho's got 'em.
Sounds pretty careless.
Nuh-uh, it's a universal truth.
In fact, they call it\Nthe law of forgetting
the lender or something.
You made that up.
Hello, this is Kagami.
\NHey, Hiiragi, it's me, Misao.
Oh, hey, how's it going?
\NOh!
Dammit, I dropped it.
What the heck\Nare you doing,
you okay?
Huh? Oh, yeah,\NI'm fine, no worries.
So, what's up, why'd you call?
\NOh, yeah,
why did I call you?
How should I know?
It was something\Nreally important too.
Then don't forget it.
I just looked at the\Nwinning numbers
for the autumn jumbo lottery,
but I didn't win.
Guess getting the winning\Nticket's pretty rare.
I sent in a ton of\Npostcards for something,
and I didn't win\Nanything either.
I guess it sucks for\Nboth of us, huh?
But if it's this hard to win,
maybe its because the people\Nwho run these lotteries
and giveaways are cheating\Nand don't want anyone to win.
It isn't nice to say\Nthings like that
about people, Konata.
\NI can't do this.
I should go to sleep.
I better go to the\Nbathroom first.
They say I talk to\Nmyself too much,
but that doesn't matter at all.
Why did saying a dumb\Njoke like that wake me up?
I was so sleepy before.
Oh, I'm done.
I don't have to use the bathroom
so I better hop into\Nbed while I'm sleepy.
Cold!
I was so sleepy too.
Why does my futon\Nhave to be so cold
when I get in?
It totally woke me up.
Maybe 'cause it's warm tonight
I'll get to sleep faster.
Now my feet are hot and\NI can't get to sleep.
Why, why?
Does this stuff only\Nhappen to me?
\NLucky Star.
Roasted sweet potatoes\Ntaste the best
this time of year.
Yeah, but you know, Kagami--
I already know what\Nyou're gonna say,
so don't say it, all right?
Here, you want some?
Thanks but no thanks,
that stuff makes you fat.
And she says it anyway.
Look, I couldn't help it, okay.
I made eye contact\Nwith the vendor.
I mean, you can't\Njust walk away
without buying\Nanything after that.
He looked at me like I was\Ngonna hurt his feelings
if I didn't buy something.
Yeah, I know exactly\Nwhat you mean.
At Comiket, it's hard\Nto put the book down
after eye contact.
No one understands\Nwhat you're talking about
and you don't really\Ncare, do you?
What do you mean?
That's what it's like\Nwhen you're checking
out the tables in\Nthe artist alley.
If you pick up a\Nbook and the seller's
standing right in front of you,
you feel bad about\Ngoing to another table
without buying it.
But in the end you\Ndon't buy it, do you?
They're turning a\Nlot a light novels
into anime lately, aren't they?
Yeah, I noticed.
The one I let you\Nborrow the other day
has been turned into an\Nanime three times so far.
They're also gonna\Nrelease a new volume soon.
Yeah, I saw the\Nanime version of it,
but I still haven't gotten\Naround to the book yet.
All those words\Nkinda wear me out.
Here we go again.
Look, those games you\Nplay have way more words
in them, don't they?
Yeah, I guess so.
But wouldn't it be\Nreally awesome
if they released all those\Nbooks as dating sims?
Now, that's what\NI'm talking about.
Hey!
Yeah, I know.
Anyway, I wonder when\Nseason four is gonna start.
\NWait, what?
Is that like product\Nplacement or something?
Hey, Yu-chan,
you okay over there?\NYou need some help?
It's this lid.
Every time I try to close it
it ends up crooked.
Oh, it's okay.
It's no big deal.
This kind of stuff\Nhappens to everybody.
But I keep doing it.
Here you go.
I think it's cute how\Nyou and Miyuki-san
have the whole\Nclumsy thing going on.
You're so awesome, oneichan,
thanks a bunch for\Nhelping me out.
Oh, no, what do I do?
It won't open.
Uh, oh, my bad.
I'm always doing\Nstuff like that.
I guess I don't know\Nmy own strength.
Is that bag giving you trouble?
Come on, hand it over.
Thanks, oneichan,\Nyou're the best.
Hey, what the--
open!
Rotten bag.
Why don't you try tearing from
the jaggedy edge of the bag?
Hang on, I'm gonna open\Nthis thing up proper or else!
Fire.
Hey, oneichan,
maybe you should use a\Npair of scissors on it.
No!
If I use scissors, it'd be like
I let this thing beat\Nme or something!
Is that a mosquito?
Yup.
Even if it hasn't\Nlaunched a full on attack,
it pisses me off just knowing\Nit's around here somewhere.
But now that I know it's here,
I'm gonna make sure\Nit goes down hard.
Look out, my hunter\Ninstinct's about to kick in.
Hey, Dad, wanna know\Nwhat I was just thinking?
If Yu-chan was asked out\Nby a guy from her class
and I was asked out by\Na guy from my class,
does that mean those guys\Nhave lolita complexes?
Oh, boy.
I guess if the guy's in\Nthe same grade as you,
it's safe to say\Nhe doesn't have one.
Then again, both\Nyou girls look younger
than you really are,
so I guess there's that.
Hmm. If a girl's 30 years old,
but she looks like she's\Nin elementary school,
if that's the case,
you could say the\Nguy prefers older women.
That's a good question, hun.
I don't know if there's an\Neasy answer for it, though.
It's so cool I can\Nask you stuff like that.
If I ask Kagami, she'd\Nsay something like,
"I don't care."
How about you, Dad,
-are you like that?\N-Hmm?
Well, you loved Mom and\Nshe looked young,
and I know you love\Nhaving me for a daughter.
Does that mean you\Nhave a lolita complex?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not exactly what\Nyour old man's about.
I also have a lolita complex\Nis a better way of putting it.
I mean, sure I like young girls,
but I also like normal girls,
I don't discriminate.
Either way, that's\Nstill pretty creepy, Dad.
Look, you've always been\Nsuper clingy with me,
but I was wondering\Nif I was a boy
instead of a girl,
would you still be\Nall clingy with me?
Yeah, sure, of course I would.
I totally get where\Nyou're coming from.
I bet you're glad I\Nturned out to be a girl.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Yu-chan, I know you\Nwanted to take a bath,
so how about you go first, okay?
\NThanks, I won't take long.
He's feeling\Nweird about her hearing this.
-Hey, Dad, you know what?\N-Hmm?
I've been thinking about Mom,
how she knew you all her life
and how she was\Npetite and stuff,
she was kinda like a\Ncharacter in a dating sim.
When she was a\Nlittle kid, Kanata sure
was a cutie pie.
I know you were always head\Nover heels in love with her,
but I was wondering,
why did she wanna marry you?
Well, I made her feel guilty.
I told her it was\Nher fault I turned into
a dating sim-loving maniac
'cause she always ignored me.
I'm being serious, Dad.
But it's the truth.
You guilted her\Ninto marrying you?
No, of course not,\NI'm kidding, honey,
you know that.
But when you were\Nborn, your mom and me
were the happiest\Npeople in the world.
Her little mole\Nlooks just like yours.
Yeah, but she's\Ngot your eyes, Kanata,
no doubt about it.
She's our daughter.
I'm worried, though.
I hope she doesn't\Ngrow up to be like
either of us.
I don't want her\Nto be short like me
or a raving geek like you.
Thanks a lot, honey.
What got your thinking about\Nyour mom all of a sudden?
Well, I guess\NI just don't know
all that much\Nabout her, that's all.
Konata,
are you lonely 'cause\Nyour mother's not around?
No, not really.
I mean, Yu-chan's here now
and you can be such a spaz,
it's almost like having\Ntwo people around.
I guess.
\NYou see her, Kanata,
she turned out\Npretty good, hasn't she?
She might not be as\Nnormal as you wanted,
but she's a good girl.
-Hey, Konata?\N-Hmm?
You gotta promise me\Nsomething, honey bunny,
don't die before I do, okay?
Okay, I wasn't really\Nplanning on it or anything.
Thanks, kid.
Kanata was really young\Nwhen she passed away.
She was laughing and\Ntalking about how happy
she was right up to the end,
I get sad sometimes\Nthinking about her.
But when my time comes,\NI hope I go out like that.
What are you\Ntalking about, Dad?
You wanna die laughing?
Mmm, I wanna get moed to death.
Come on, be serious, Dad,
or you're never\Ngonna die a proper death.
I'm kidding.
Anyway, I bought a new\Ncamera for work today.
You wanna help me test it out?
\NAh.
It's been so long\Nsince I was here.
\NNo, Dad, stop.
\NI wonder what they're up to.
Sounds like they're having fun.
\NSay cheese!
\NDad, you said...
Cool, get ready for another.
Come on, dad, you\Ngot enough shots
and you're hanging all over me.
Aw, come on, honey,
what's the big deal?
I just wanna get\Na few pictures of us
with my new camera.
I thought you said\Nyou got it for work.
Aw, come on, don't--
\NYou're the same as always.
You still like making\Npeople do everything
you wanna do,\Neven if they don't.
Why are you being\Nso mean to me, Konata?
-Hyah!\N-Whoa!
\NHe hasn't changed a bit, has he?
You know something,
whenever I hug you,\Nyou feel just like
how Kanata felt,
and I really like it.
\NYou shouldn't say
creepy things like that, ever!
I bet Mom had\Nher hands full with you.
\NWhat do you mean?
\NYeah, sort of.
But your dad's a good person,
so listen to what he says, okay?
Oh, you know that\Ngame you were playing
the other day?
After you figure it out,
you think you could tell\Nme how to finish it?
Sure, you got it.
That thing is way\Nharder than I thought
it was gonna be.
It's nice to see that\Nthey play games together.
I guess they're doing\Nokay after all.
I can't get to the sex\Nscene of this one character--
\NWhoa!
What kind of\Ngames are you playing
with our daughter anyway?
Oh, boy, I hope she's okay.
You better not be teaching\Nher anything bad, So-kun.
Hey,
why do you think Mom\Nchose to marry you anyway?
Huh?
\NI mean, you're a pervy old geek
with a lolita complex,
why would anyone pick you?
\NI can't believe you said that.
I think pervy old geek\Nis a little bit harsh.
\NSuper harsh.
Anyway, let's get\Nback to your mom.
\NShe's right, though.
You were always like this.
And sometimes I almost forget
why you were the one...
And I was a loser.
...I wanted to be with.
There was one thing I\Nwas absolutely sure of.
\NHuh?
\NWhy'd you stop?
What was it?
What were you so sure of?
Hmm?
I was sure that no one\Nelse could ever love Kanata
as much as I did.
Oh,
there it is.
Yeah, that's it.
You can't beat that.
\NHe accepts all the good in me,
along with all the bad.
He shares everything with me,
the good,
and the bad.
I felt so safe and\Nhappy with you.
It was the only place
I ever felt so safe and happy.
Know what I mean?
Since we're in such\Na good mood now,
I think this calls\Nfor a picture.
\NI feel kind of sad I can't
be there with the\Ntwo of you right now.
Well, yeah.
Geez, Dad, that camera's\Nnot for work, is it?
Man.
\NWhat?
I'm just trying to\Nget used to it.
I don't wanna be\Nfiguring this out
when I'm on assignment.
\NBut,
you and Konata are\Nalways with me.
And as long as the\Ntwo of you keep
me alive inside your hearts,
we'll always be together.
Look, it's flashing,\Nit's flashing.
\NYou gave me so much happiness.
-May your lives be blessed...\N-Here it comes!
...with as much joy as mine was.
Cheese.
\NI wonder what they'll say.
Ah! Dad, look at
-this picture!\N-Hmm?
Ah!
Whose shadow is that\Nin the background?
I think it's a ghost.
\NHuh, what?
Okay, I'm all done.
-Yu-chan!\N-Wait!
\NLook at this picture!
\NWhat-- what's wrong?
\NWe gotta delete it,
it's cursed.
Quick delete it!
\NNo, stop, don't delete it!
\NNo deleting it won't work,
we have to burn\Nit in a holy bonfire!
\NDon't you dare burn that camera!
After talking to her\Na bit more and stuff,
I can see she's not the person
I thought she was.
But Minamin is still\Npretty darn scary.
She's not scary, she's sweet.
Oh, look there she is.
Hi, Minami-chan.
Hi, Yutaka.
\NWow, those two sure are close.
Yeah, close.
Yutaka, your tie is crooked.
Oh, onee-sama.
Ah!
I'm fantasizing\Nabout my friends again.
Oh, God, I'm all pent up!
\NHmm?
\N"Lucky Star."
In three,\Ntwo, one, we're live.
\NWell, where are they?
What do you mean they're gone?
Where the hell are they?
Call their managers!
Whatever, they're\Nall getting fired.
Never liked that\Nstupid show anyway.
\NWe're live.
I knew something\Nlike this would happen.
\NHey!
You know\NI turned this gig down.
Yeah, turned it down.
But I had to do it anyway.
Politics, man,
gotta be grown up about it.
\NHey!
We're rolling.
\NHuh, what's rolling?
Me, you, the Earth?
\NNo, we're rolling!
The camera's rolling!
\NHoly crap!
Cut, cut!
One, two, three, four.
-\N-
-\N-
On the next\Nepisode of Lucky Star.
\NSoujiro here.
\NKanata here.
Well, So-kun,\NI better get going.
-You're leaving now?\N-Mm-hmm.
\NTake me with you.
I know I can't separate\Nmy spirit from my body,
but I can learn.
\NSo-kun, if you're going to talk
about anime and\Nmanga, I'm leaving.
Bye.
\NNo, Kanata!
Next time, "Delicate Line."
\NSo-kun, I can't fly well
in all this turbulence!
\NOh, brother.
\NSenior Year, Class B?
\NMs. Kuroi!
\NYeah, yeah.
Hey, Konata, can I borrow\Nyour computer for a second?
I just remembered about\Nthis committee meeting
that's coming up, and I need\Nto write something for it.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, I have been feeling\Na little out of whack lately.
But I think\NI'll be ready on time.
I'd like to get\Na bigger head start...
but I don't want to rush it,
because I want\Nto make sure everybody is
feeling comfortable with it.
And I'd like it if we could\Nwork out all the details
of the assignment.
Yeah, so are you gonna\Ntell me what's going on
with your computer, or what?
Hah hah! Maybe other people's\Ncomputers are just too hard
for you to deal with, Kagami.
Whoa!
I didn't check my email\Nfor a couple of days,
and now my inbox is megas full!
You get email?
I never pictured you\Nas being all that popular.
Okay.
It's called your inner voice\Nfor a reason.
You gotta keep it inside.
A good 90% of my emails\Nare phisher spam.
I bet it's because of all\Nthe sketchy sites I visit.
I'm pretty sure you\Nshouldn't admit that to a cop.
In fact, I'm positive.
Isn't it amazing how\Nthese guys always come up
with the funniest things\Nto put in the subject line?
I mean,\Nsome of this stuff's hilarious.
\NYeah, I know.
Wow, it's copying pretty fast.
Looks like it'll be done\Nbefore I know it.
Huh.
Ugh! How can anyone\Nrely on what the timer says
when it goes up and down\Nlike that! Jeez!
Late night snacking\Ncalls for a bowl
of instant ramen, baby.
How could you\Ntease me like that?
Hey there!
Ooh, thanks.
Is it true that Konata and\NYutaka both caught a cold?
Uh-oh. Hey, Yutaka.\NHow you doing?
I haven't had a cold in awhile.\N
Hi, Konata! How you feeling?
What's up, Neisan?\NHow's it going?
Uh-huh.
Funny how you don't have\Nthe energy to go to school,
but you've got enough\Nto play your games.
Uh, yeah, well you see--
aw, you know\Nhow it is, don't ya?
\NHello!
Wow, thanks for coming\Nby to visit, Minami,
and thanks for bringing\Nyour friends along, too.
That darn cold\Nreally nailed her,
but I gotta say\NI've never seen her
as healthy\Nas she's been lately.
Thanks a lot for being\Nthere for her, Minami-chan.
Oh, it's okay, really.
Back in Junior High,
Yutaka had maybe\None or two good friends,
so I guess you must be\Nreally special to her.
She just can't stop talking\Nabout you, Minami-chan.
And I've never seen her\Nhave this much fun
at school before, either.
You know how when you're sick
people say\Nit's all in your head?
Well, when you're busy\Nhaving fun,
you don't have time\Nto think about being sick.
\NHello!
Wow, thanks for coming\Nby to visit, Minami,
and thanks for bringing\Nyour friends along, too.
That darn cold\Nreally nailed her,
but I've gotta say that\NI've never seen her
as healthy\Nas she's been lately.
Thanks a lot for being\Nthere for her, Minami-chan.
Oh, it's okay, really.
\NBack in Junior High,
Yutaka had maybe\None or two good friends,
so I guess you must be\Nreally special to her.
She just can't stop talking\Nabout you, Minami-chan.
-\N-I've never seen her have
this much fun\Nat school before, either.
Minami-chan, Tamura-san,\NPatty-chan, please come in.
How are you feeling?
Promise me\Nyou'll get well soon, okay?
Uh-huh, I just wish\NI wasn't all weak and frail,
because I hate being sick.
I feel bad\Nfor making everyone worry.
No way!\NBeing weak and frail like that
is a great way to get people\Nto make a fuss over you.
Yeah, well,\Nit might look like fun
to someone\Nwho isn't weak and frail,
but if you're weak and frail,\Nit probably sucks.
Hmm, I guess that's like saying
how if you've got\Na little sister in real life,
you probably won't think\Nlittle sisters are moe.
\NYeah! That's right.
Whoa! Watch out, the normal\Npeople are attacking us
with weird looks!
I'm being blinded\Nby their aura of confusion!
We can't help\Nthat we're different!
We're outlaws\Nin an ordinary world!
Speaking of things we wish\Nwere different about ourselves,
Minami-chan wishes\Nshe had bigger boobs.
-\N-Wow, is that for real?
No, it's not like that.
\NI heard that if you massaged
your boobs, they get bigger.
\NYeah, I heard that too.
Are you sure it's okay,\NMinami-chan?
Yes, I'm positive.
You're the only person\NI could ever ask, Yutaka.
Okay, here goes.
Oh, easy, girl!\NGet a hold of yourself.
Wow, that's cool, Tamura-san.
I didn't know you were\Nfrom that circle.
Yeah, and I had stuff\Nat last summer's Comiket.
I bought\Na couple of your books.
They're good.
Oh, thanks a lot.
That's so cool.
I'd love to read some of the\Nmanga you've drawn, Tamura-san.
Will you let me borrow yours?
Sure, I'll go get--\N
Please, you don't want\Nto do that.
Come on, Hiyorin,\Ndon't you want everyone
to experience the doujin\Nyou worked so hard on?
You don't understand.
That stuff's not\Nfor the general market.
Have mercy.
Oh, Hiyorin,\Njust give it up already.
\NIsn't that amazing?
Now, let's review.
Chewing gum containing xylitol
has been proven to destroy\Nthe germs that cause cavities,
because when the xylitol\Nis absorbed by the germs
that cause cavities,\Nit depletes the ATP
in the bacteria and also it\Ndissolves the cavity itself.
And...
If it's really\Nthat good for my teeth,
I should try it.
I was chewing the gum because\Nit was good for my teeth,
but it made me lose a filling,
so I had to go to the dentist.
A pitiful\Nand unlucky Miyuki-san is moe.
So that's what\Npoor, sweet Miyuki-san
was crying about today.
-Yeah?\N-Oh yeah.
Oh, um, okay.
That's what Onee-chan\Nsaid happened to her.
So that's why Miyuki-san\Nseemed so gloomy.
Um, I'm really sorry about\Nwhat happened to Miyuki-san,
but that's great material!
This sucks, it's been forever\Nsince I've had a good idea.
How do you come up with\Nideas for manga anyway?
Hmm. I don't have\Nany surefire method or anything,
but I usually get ideas
-from real life and stuff.\N-
From real life, huh?
You read them, didn't you?
Well, that depends on--
Admit it, you did!
Well, I--
She showed you,\Neven after all that begging.
Um, I'm sorry.
Those stories\Nweren't from real life.
Anyway, I thought\Nthe stories were good
and really fun to read.
Right, thanks a lot.
And there were a few that\Nfelt like they happened to me.
I got a feeling of deja vu\Nwhile reading them.
I'd like to read some\Nof her stories too.
I bet those stories\Nwere based on you guys!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Huh?
Oh, hey, how's it going, ma'am?\NGood morning.
Up all night\Nplaying games again?
Or maybe you did some\Nlate-night anime watching?
You know it, and these days\Nthere's tons more anime series
on late at night.\NYeah, that rules.
Okay, you could at least lie
and tell me you were studying.
I've been seriously\Nthinking about splurging
on a DVD recorder or something.
That might help.
\NSave your money. Why bother?
You'll record the shows\Nand never get around to 'em.
Kinda like\Nhow your games pile up.
Huh? What are you talking about?
Whoa, hang on a second.\NYou've gotta be kidding.
Yeah, right, you wish.
Listen, I don't have anything\Nto do with any of it.
Uh...
Hey, it's me.
Did you just hang up on me?
I guess we got disconnected.
Yeah, I had three bars.
Anyway, I was acting\Nimmature a minute ago.
Sorry.
No, I didn't hang up on you.
That's not why.
I can't believe\NI'm back for another visit.
Let's have ourselves\Na peek inside, shall we?
Not to worry. We just need\Nto pop the filling back in,
and you'll be as right as rain.
Now, about that tooth\Nin the back.
I believe\NI've detected some decay.
We should\Nstart treatment immediately.
\N"Lucky Star."
-Oh.\N-Hmm?
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing, sis.
I just kind of realized\Nhow much strawberries smell
like shortcakes is all.
I get it.\NYou meant to say that shortcakes
smell like strawberries, right?
You know, because they have\Nstrawberries inside them.
Huh?
I guess.
It's okay.\NIt's not like getting confused
like that's a bad thing.
Good morning, everybody.
I hope you slept well.
-Hey, Yu-chan. Good morning.\N-Good morning.
\NHere's today's pooch!
Wow, look at all the animals.
They're doing some kind\Nof special about pets.
First,\NI'd like to introduce you
to a Welsh Corgi named Koo!
Wow, it's a corgi!
He's super cute.
I don't know about the dog,
but the owner\Nis pretty darn cute.
And her thigh-high socks\Nget extra points.
There's just enough skin showing\Nbetween them and her skirt.
She'd look awesome\Nin a Gothic maid ensemble.
\NNext we have Sylviana,
-a Siberian husky.\N-
Look, a husky.\NI like huskies a lot.
I wonder why you don't see\Nthem that much nowadays.
Whoa! Tsundere! Now that's\Nwhat I'm talking about.
Moe-tastic.
Anybody who likes\Nto walk around with their hair
in ponytails is\Ndefinitely tsundere.
Wow, I didn't know you were\Ninto playing games and stuff.
Yeah, but I suck\Nbig time at 'em.
You want to play or something?
\NYou're awesome, Hiiragi.
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!\NI can't believe you did that.
Did you see that?\NIsn't Hiiragi amazing?
Yeah, she is.
\NWatching her have so much fun
makes me feel like a loser,
because all\NI care about's winning.
That's a ton of stinky.
Can something stinky be moe?
Oh, hey there, Patricia-san.
How's it going?
We're seeing you a lot
on this side\Nof the school these days.
Well, Patty's really\Nenthusiastic about learning.
In fact, you could say\NI've taken her under my wing.
I'm teaching her everything\Nshe needs to know
about the essence\Nof Japanese culture.
Yeah, whatever,\Nif you're teaching her,
she's only gonna be learning
about a sub-culture,\Nif anything.
But otaku are the pride\Nof Japanese culture.
-Mm-hmm.\N-I'm on a mission to absorb
everything I can here,
take it all back to America
and distribute it\Nto the faithful.
You're right about one thing,
she is enthusiastic.
Anyway, what about music,\NPatricia-san?
Do you have any favorite bands\Nthat you like?
Hmm, let me see.
-There's Orange Range...\N-
...Chemist, Suneohair,\NPorno Graffitti,
L'Arc-en-Ciel, DEEN, Nightmare,\Nand a bunch of others.
I listen to all kinds\Nof different Japanese bands.
Wow, you sure do.
That's impressive,\Nbut all the bands you just named
sing anime songs.
Wow! Good one, Konita!\NYou're so sharp.
And you're only listening\Nto the songs
they did for anime, right?
Ah! You know, I really need\Nto get myself a maid.
-Huh?\N-It'd be nice to get a maid.
Yeah, I guess\Nthat would be nice.
I heard\Nyou don't live in a dorm,
but you have a place\Nall to yourself.
Yep, and the cooking,\Nlaundry, manga,
and anime keep me busy.
I bet it's hard, especially\Nif you're not used to it.
No wonder you want to get\Nyourself a housekeeper.
Oh no, I don't want\Nto get a housekeeper.
I want to get a maid.
I didn't even know\Nthere was a difference.
What? You're kidding, right?
They're totally different.
Hasn't this country\Ntaught you anything?
Actually, I think you might
be getting\Nthe wrong idea about Japan.
No, I'm sorry, girl, I can't.
Fried food's a no-no.
She knows\Nyou'll give in, Minami.
that's why she isn't going away.
I'll take care of her, hon.
Come on,\NI've got something for you.
\NSlow down, girl.
\NBut, now I feel so lonely.
Everybody in our class\Nthinks she's too quiet
and really scary,
but the truth is\Nthat she's super-kind,
totally awesome,\Nand really cool!
You know her,\Nshe's the one staying over
at Izumi-san's house.
She just admires her so much.
Oh, does she now?
Minami-chan,\Nwould you take this?
I have to agree, she is\Nrather awesome and cool,
isn't she?
Yes, why even Izumi-san\Nthinks so.
Minami-chan always gives\Noff this cool-headed,
Little Miss Perfect vibe.
But when she's with Yu-chan,\Nyou can tell
that she is really\Na good human being.
And that's\Nwhat she said about her.
Oh, I'm sorry,\Nbecause it's on sale,
we have to limit it\Nto only one per customer.
-\N-Oh, my.
She's cool-headed\Nand a Little Miss Perfect.
And here's what Kagami-san\Nand Tsukasa-san
have to say about her.
Minami-chan seems like\Nthe type who does everything
quickly, efficiently,\Nand perfectly.
I think Minami-chan is awesome,\Nbecause she seems
like she can do anything.
I wish I could be like her.
Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san\Nspeak so highly of Minami-chan.
I think it's wonderful\Nthat everyone admires her.
Yeah, but, Mom, I can't
because it's limited\Nto one per customer.
Huh? Oh. Mm-hmm.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
She does everything quickly,\Nefficiently, and perfectly.
-Hey, you.\N-Hey, girl.
Hey, what's up?
Whatcha watching there?
It's just some mecha\Nanime series I rented.
This looks really cool.
You sure are into this stuff,\Naren't you?
Mmm. Yeah, but I'm not really
that much into mecha\Nor anything.
What?
What do you mean\Nyou're not into mecha?
Why the heck are you\Nwatching the show then?
In order to attract\Na broader audience,
the creators of these\Nmecha series are tossing in
a lot more cute boy\Nand girl characters.
Pretty clever, huh?
What's the point\Nin calling it mecha anymore?
Got that, Hiiragi?\NI'm counting on you for real,
so promise me.
I want to hear you say it.\NGo on, say it.
Yeah, sure, relax,\NI'll take care of it.
Come on, Misa-chan,\Nyou heard her.
She said she'd take care of it.
-Huh?\N-I wouldn't bother her
too much if I were you.
If there's one thing\NI've learned about people,
it's this--\Nwhenever somebody says,
"Sure, I'll take care of it,"
chances are they're not\Ngonna take care of nothing.
\NShe picks the weirdest things
to be right about.
Kagami-sama!
Do you wanna go with me\Nto Gamers today?
I got stuff to do today.
And besides, there isn't\Nanything I want to buy.
Oh, come on, man.
It's not gonna take\Nthat long, I promise.
-No thanks.\N-Yes thanks.
Leave 'em alone.
Why do you always go\Nto Gamers, anyway?
Isn't there a bookstore\Nby your house you can go to?
Once you've been inside\Na specialty store like Gamers,
ordinary bookstores don't seem\Nlike they got you covered.
I mean good luck finding all\Nthe things you're looking for.
It's probably\Nbecause all the things
you're looking for\Nare too weird.
Okay, what are you gonna get?
Just this. I'm good to go.
You're watching that one too?
Oh no, I haven't seen the anime,
but when I saw the cover,
I couldn't help but think\Nthat I needed to get it.
Like we were somehow connected.
I couldn't fight this feeling\Nno matter how hard I try.
You're talking crazy.
I finally figured out the\Nphilosophy behind the reason
why people buy stuff\Nbased on the cover art.
For example, you picked\Nthe light novels you read
based on the art, right?
Yeah, you're right.\NYou got me there.
So, when you buy\Na book on a whim
and it turns out to be good,\Nyou think you totally scored.
And even if it turns out that\Nthe book you bought sucks,
you don't care 'cause\Nyou bought it on a whim.
Either way, it's a once-\Nin-a-lifetime opportunity.
That's a good way of putting it,
and I totally see where you're\Ncoming from, but I don't buy it.
-\N-Huh?
A once-in-a-lifetime\Nopportunity, huh?
Achoo!
That was a big one.
You might want to cover\Nyour mouth next time.
Well, you know it's not like\Nyou can control your sneezes.
I've never actually\Nseen anyone go "achoo"
when they sneezed.\NThat was hilarious.
Achoo!
\NEven with a sneeze,
the difference\Nbetween us is huge.
It's not fair!
You're so darn cute,\Nit's totally unfair!
Whoa, down, girl.
So, if you go all the way\Naround, it doesn't stink so bad.
Is it true\Nthey stopped doing it?
You know,\Nyou guys get along great.
Hmm?
Do you guys ever argue\Nor anything?
All the time.
She looks all sweet and mellow,\Nbut if you piss her off,
-she'll cut you, man.\N-
Yeah, I guess there's\Nsome people out there
-who are like that.\N-Oh, come on, leave me alone.
That reminds me, even when\Nyou're not mad, you're scary.
Darn it, I should have known
I was getting set up\Nfor something like that.
We just found out that\NMinami-chan got the same time
as you\Nin the hundred-meter dash.
Oh yeah, that's awesome.
Although, if we ever had a race,\NI'd totally beat her
because of my boobs.
You want to try it?
Well, yeah,\Nbut she could still win
because of her height, right?
Can't she?
Wow, she totally ignored me,\Ndidn't she?
Hey, don't you\Nthink so too, Hiiragi?
Isn't that the funniest\Nthing ever, Hiiragi?
Mmm.
Know what\NI'm talking about, Hiiragi?
\NMmm.
\NMisa-chan's attitude is
"Answer me\Nwhen I'm speaking to you,"
and Hiiragi-chan's is\N"Don't bother me, I'm reading."
Things are starting to get\Npretty tense around here.
I think it's so awesome\Nhow the characters
in anime and games have all\Nthis moe built into them.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, is that right\Nor is the image corrupted?
Nah, it's supposed\Nto look all blurry
and pixelated like that.
Oh, I kinda like how\Nit's blurry and pixelated.
-Ahem!\N-
So, what kind of game\Nare you underage
high school chicks\Nplaying, huh?
-\N-What's everybody doing here?
It's none\Nof your business, Yu-chan!
\NThat's all she wrote.
It's been forever\Nsince I updated the blog
with a big old entry.
I just gotta publish it and...
Ah! No!
Back, back, go back!
\N"Lucky Star."
Okay, I ain't your mom,\Nso I'm not gonna waste my breath
giving you jerks\Na scolding today.
Gloomy.
And I don't even care about\Nhow we all ended up here.
You guys still with me?
Fantastic.
Anyway, I heard\Nyou losers built this show up
from nothing, yeah?
So now that you made it\Nto the last couple
of episodes,\Nyou geniuses think
you're gonna bust\Nthe place down?
Unhappy.
People say I'm a mean bastard,
and you know I've done things
that'd make\Nyour hair turn white.
But this is the first time\NI've been called in
to stop a boring-ass argument!
-You awake? Good boy.\N-
If we don't get this thing\Nresolved right freaking now,
it's gonna make me look bad.
And we don't want that,\Ndo we, Shiraishi?
-No, we don't, Gottoza-sama.\N-Huh? Do we?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.
Hmm.
You're awfully quiet.
-I'm so very sorry.\N-Huh?
I'm so very sorry, Gottoza-sama.
\NAll right, you guys,
how's about we wrap\Nthis thing up for today?
Okay? Come here, you freak.
You got one more episode\Nof "Lucky Channel,"
so go out\Nand make it awesome.
'Kay? We good now?
\NYes, ma'am.
I can't hear you!
\NYes, ma'am, we're good!
And now\Nthat we got that settled,
ball's in your court now.\NDon't screw it up.
Keep your noses clean
and maybe you guys'll get\Nsomewhere in this industry.
Well, I guess\NI'm gonna be heading out now.
I'll let the producer know\Nabout our little talk,
and about how good you were.
Gimme a shout\Nif you guys need anything,
and I'll send\Na couple of my boys down
to give y'all a hand.
-\N-Vroom. Vroom, vroom.
Vroom, vroom.
-\N-
On the next\Nepisode of "Lucky Star"...
\NCome on, everybody!
There's only one more episode,\Nso let's do this right.
Hello? You guys listening?
Fine, whatever.\NI'll just do it by myself, then.
Next time, "To Be Decided."
No way!\NThey haven't decided?
The arts festival's here.
Can you guys believe
it's that time again?
Time for exams too.
The second trimester's\Nalways a pain
'cause there's\Ntoo much stuff to do.
This is our last\Narts festival in high school
and you're gonna whine\Nabout something like that?
That sign says,\N"Opening Ceremony."
Do you guys know\Nwhat that's about?
It's a tradition for the\Nschool's Outou Festival.
A group of volunteers has to\Ncome up with the opening act
and perform it.
-\N-
\NI just had an awesome idea!
All right.\NI guess it's unanimous.
We'll have a room where people\Ncan get their fortunes told.
So before next homeroom\Neveryone needs to decide
what type of fortunes\Nthey want to tell.
-\N-I'm so touched.
You did your best.
Here's my idea.
We all dress up like\Ncheerleaders and do a dance.
For what?
For the Opening\NCeremony of the festival.
That's what.
It's the perfect thing to do\Nif you want to get a lot
of people in the mood\Nto have some fun.
Yeah, it's over the top,\Nbut it's kinda cool.
I know!
And everyone here's gonna\Nlove the show we put on!
-Uh...\N-When you said we-- wait.
Ah! Don't tell me you've\Nalready signed us up for it.
When I asked the teacher,
I was told\NI had to turn in a proposal
along with a list of\Nall the wonderful people
-who were gonna help.\N-
Huh? Ohh.
Oh.
So, how about it, Yutaka?
Oh, I...
But, Yu-chan, wouldn't it be\Na little too physical for you?
-Maybe. Or maybe not.\N-
If it isn't any trouble,\NI think I'd like to try it.
-I think.\N-It's no trouble.
None of us could imagine\Ndoing it without you,
so welcome to the team!
\NAre you sure about this?
It sounds like it's gonna\Nbe a lot of work and stuff,
and I don't wanna slow\Nanyone down or anything.
But I think it could be\Na really good challenge for me.
Yay! Don't worry\Nabout a thing, Yutaka.
You're gonna be great!
So how about it, guys?\NYou in?
Uh...
Okay then, count me in.
Yeah. I guess\Nif you're all gonna do it--
You guys are the best!\NYou're awesome!
\NReally? Fortune-telling?
Here's a question.
Do you even know\Nhow to tell a fortune?
Hm-mmm. Not at all.
-Ugh!\N-For real?
Jeez, wasn't it your idea?
It's an arts festival.
You don't have to be 100%\Naccurate or anything.
Oh! Hey, Sis,\Nwhat's your class
gonna be doing\Nfor the arts festival?
Well, we're sorta doing the\Ntypical haunted house thing.
Cool.
Hmm. How typical.
Well, no one in class came\Nup with anything better, so.
Yeah, what?
Oh, nothing.
Sounds perfect if you ask me.
What's that supposed to mean?
Whoa!\NDon't get the monster angry!
I totally knew you'd say that.
Patty-chan told us\Nshe wanted to do
a cheerleading routine.
Yeah?
And then,\NI thought it might be fun
if I tried helping out too.
Yeah?
Wait, why now?
I guess I've been absent\Nfrom school so much
and I never had the chance to\Nwork on any class projects.
But lately,\NI've been feeling a lot better.
And I've always wanted to\Ndo something fun like this,
and Patty-chan needs the help.
So, maybe it's a sign\NI should do it or something.
Hmm. I don't know.
It sounds like\Nit could be tough for you.
I know it does.
So Patty-chan was wondering\Nif you'd help out.
If you were there,\NI know I'd feel better.
Please, please, please.
I don't know about this.
But you're really\Nathletic and everything.
And if you and Minami-chan\Nare both there,
I know it would help me do the\Nbest I can and keep me going.
You really want me there\Nand Patty's asking too.
Oh, I gotta think about this.
-\N-Huh?
Izumi residence.
Good evening, Konata.
Oh, hey, Patty.
I just found out\Nabout that thing,
but I don't know\Nif I'm the right--
♪ Bum, bum, bum, bum! ♪
Time for a little quiz!
Right now\NI'm holding in my hand
a certain ticket to something.
Can you tell me what upcoming\Nevent this ticket's for?
Hmm.
Wait, you're kidding!
Oh, Konata.
I heard you loved\Nher last concert.
Don't you want to shake\NHaruhi's hand?
I know you do.
Yes, I wanna shake her hand!\NI do, I do, I do!
I wanna go!\NI wanna see Aya!
Well,\Nwhat were you gonna say
before I interrupted you?
Huh?
-Yu-chan?\N-Huh?
\NOkay, count me in!
Let's go have some fun!
Oh, okay.
So, anyway,
if you aren't a cheerleader,\Nthen you're not cool.
What are you talking about?
Patty was thinking\Nabout putting together
a cheerleading routine\Nfor the opening act
of the arts festival.
Oh yeah, I can totally\Nsee her doing that.
I know.\NAnd it's been decided
you and Tsukasa\Nare doing it, too.
Huh?
Oh! Can you think\Nof anyone else in your class
who might be good\Nat cheerleading?
-Whoa, hang on a sec!\N-
Could you at least give us\Na minute to think about it?
I don't even think\NI can do anything like that.
What?
Come on, you'll never get\Nanother chance to do this.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Hmm.
Wouldn't it be fun\Nto do something like this
with all your friends?\NAt a festival?
I mean,\Nthe more the merrier, right?
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, count me in.
-\N-
You're a total pushover,\Nyou know that?
Sorry, but I can't.
I got a ton of stuff\Nto do for my class.
It's our last\Narts festival together
and I just wanted us to\Nall be together having fun!
Why do you always\Npull out the friend card
when you want something?
I know you're faking,\Nso stop it!
-\N-
Yu-chan even volunteered
and she's\Nreally excited about it.
She did?\NIs she gonna be okay up there?
I tried to get her\Nto change her mind,
but I couldn't\Ntalk her out of it.
She's totally excited\Nabout the idea
and said how important it\Nis for her to do something
special with everyone.
-Oh, really?\N-Really.
But they're having a hard time\Nfinding people to help out.
That's why they came to us\Nto see if we wanted to do it.
I guess I might have been\Ntoo pushy a minute ago.
That was totally unfair
and I don't blame you for\Nnot wanting to help us.
\NI'll do it.
Huh? Wait, you what?
I'll do it!\NI said I'll do it, okay?
-\N-Really, Sis?
Really, you will?
You need the extra help
and my class can always\Nfind someone to replace me.
It's not like I had a choice.
\NKagami's so cute
when she acts like that.
\NCh-- cheerleading?
I honestly don't think\NI'd be very good at it.
Well, I'm still not sure\Nif we've got
everything we need\Nto pull this off.
Especially\Nin the volume department.
But I know that if you were\Nwith us jumping around on stage,
we'd be looking fine.
You really think so?
Oh, all right.
If you think I can help,\NI'd love to give it a shot.
Oh, awesome!
You're the breas--\Nuh... thank you.
Seeing how you all\Nsurvived your exams,
it's time to get out there
and start preparing\Nfor the arts festival.
And there's\Nno slacking off, or else.
\NGreat.
It'd be nice if they'd\Nease up on the tests
when we've got\Nall these events happening.
-Hey, what's up?\N-Huh?
What's happening\Nwith the cheerleading?
'Cause I haven't heard\Nanything yet.
Does anyone even know?
Patty was saying...
Hey, they approved our idea!
...before exams started.
But I haven't heard\Nanything since.
Well, that figures. Does anyone\Nrealize we need to practice
if we're gonna do this thing?
Do we even have time\Nto practice?
I don't know, ask her.
Sorry.
I haven't had the chance to\Nfigure out the choreography yet.
You gotta be kidding me.\NWhat are we gonna do?
No, wait! It took longer\Nthan I thought it would
to find the right song.
It didn't help that I\Nwas looking for something
-with a "Hare Hare" feel.\N-Yeah, whatever.
Look, if you were having\Ntrouble with something
you could have asked\Nfor some help
instead of keeping it\Nto yourself.
This cheerleader thing\Nwas your idea,
so it's your responsibility\Nto organize it.
I can't hear you.
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la. ♪
Don't play that game with me!
Suck it up and get to work!
If we're gonna do this thing,
we need\Nto get organized right now!
Miyuki and I are gonna\Nfind a place to practice
and we'll let everyone know\Nwhen and where to meet up later.
You better have some of the\Nmoves figured out by then.
Don't worry\Nabout the rough spots,
we'll fix those in rehearsal.
And next time you need help,\Nask somebody!
-Uh, yeah. So, Kagamin.\N-What?
A little while ago\Nyou didn't sound
like you wanted to help out.
So how come you're\Nall gung-ho about it now?
Shut up!
What's your thing\Ngonna be, Miyuki-san?
I'm going to tell fortunes\Nwith tarot cards.
-\N-And what's yours?
Uh, I haven't decided\Nwhat I'm doing yet.
Is there a kind of\Nfortune-telling that's so simple
even I could do it?
Let me see.
Perhaps you could give\Nshape readings to people?
The shapes\Ntell me something about
how your love life\Nis gonna be awesome
or something like that, I think.
Tsukasa, you don't know\Nwhat you're talking about,
-do you?\N-What-- what the heck?
You-- you're kidding me.
We're supposed\Nto learn how to do that?
Don't you think it's cool?
It's not that\Nwe don't like it...
But it looks very difficult.
Well, since we're out of time,\Nwe're just gonna have to
simplify the really hard moves\Nwhile we're practicing.
-That's all we can do.\N-We're so gonna die.
But if we pull this off,
it'll be the most emotional\Nmoment of our lives!
Put a sock in it!
Uh-oh, we ran out\Nof masking tape.
\NI needed a break anyway.
Come on,\Nwe'll go buy some more.
If you're going,\Nwe need some markers.
-And more blades for the cutter.\N-And boxes.
-"Playboy."\N-Glue.
Okay, somebody threw\Nsomething weird in there.
Why's everybody messing around?
If we ran out of supplies,
get off your ass\Nand go get some!
Do you guys know what
the yakisoba's supposed\Nto be called?
We're calling that one\NSpring's Fragrant Breath.
What's this thing we're calling\Nthe Fallen Drop of Sun's Dew?
Oh, that's okonomiyaki.
This menu's totally insane, man.
How's anyone gonna know\Nwhat they're ordering?
Hmm, Japanese culture\Nis so interesting.
Normally I'd agree with you
but the names of those\Ndishes are ridiculous.
Yoo-hoo!
So, what are guys gonna\Ndo for the arts festival?
It's called a Zuka cafe.
\NA what?
It's a cafe where you can\Nwatch a show that's done
in the same style\Nas the Takarazuka Revue.
You can have a girl\Nin a glamorous dress,
or if you want, a girl who's\Ncross-dressing as a nobleman
-serve as your waitress.\N-Oh!
-You can have--\N-Cross-dressing?
Ah! It's perfect!
Yu-chan and Minami-chan
are gonna be\Nour most popular servers.
It's a kaleidoscope of beauty.
Who decided we'd be doing this?
Now I'm scared.
I can do the cheerleading,\Nbut this?
Whoa!
Those guys are amazing,\Naren't they?
Yeah, I know.
They are totally\Nin sync with each other.
So tell me something.
Would you say\NMiyuki-san is being sadistic
and Minami-chan\Nis being masochistic?
Yeah, good point.
I wonder if Takara-senpai's\Ndynamic dance moves are
gonna be too much for\NMinami-chan to handle.
-Let's watch.\N-Sure, what the heck, right?
Would you guys stop\Ndrooling and go practice?
\N"Lucky Star."
The cheerleading outfits\Nare here!
Wow!
They turned out wonderfully,
but I don't think I can wear it.
But these outfits are guaranteed\Nto make the audience happy,
and that's a good thing.
You know it. The outfit\Nwas chosen by a hardcore fan
of all things cheerleadery.
Right, I heard stories\Nabout him.
Your big brother sounds\Nlike a cool guy.
Then the Zuka costumes\Nare gonna drive you crazy.
I heard you guys are gonna\Nbe doing a cheerleader routine.
\NUh-huh.
Can I come down\Nand take pictures?
As long as you\Npromise to behave yourself.
I'll behave myself.
Well, we haven't\Ngot the moves down yet.
So, I doubt if we're gonna\Nbe able to pull this off.
Don't worry, guys!
I'll give you a dose of Yui\Npower and you'll be great.
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo!
Thanks, but if we did\Ntake some of your power,
it would make us too spazzy\Nand then we'd wear out quicker.
We're almost out of time
and we still haven't gotten\Nour routine down yet.
Arts festival, huh?
I can't even remember what\Nmy class did for the one we had.
You know, our class did\Nsomething like that too.
I think it's what you guys\Ncall a manga cafe.
Right, I remember.
All the boys in class brought\Ntheir manga in that day.
You guys were\Nway ahead of your time.
These days you\Ncan bring that stuff to school
and it's no big deal.
But they had strict rules\Nabout it when I was a kid.
Festivals were they only\Ntime we could have them.
Yeah, there are people\Nwho bring manga to school,
but I don't think it's something\Nthe school is aware of.
Oh, are you really\Ngoing to tell fortunes?
Make sure you tell all your\Nclassmates that if I show up
they all have\Nto give me good fortunes.
Well, that really isn't\Nfortune-telling.
Oh, I've been meaning to ask.
What did you do for your\Nschool's arts festival?
Hmm. I think I remember\Nevery class and club
doing their own\Nseparate projects.
But, you know, in the end,
they were all rather typical\Nthings like haunted houses,
and places that serve\Nokonomiyaki.
Isn't it odd how the things\Nyou did when you were my age
are the same\Nas the things I'm doing now?
For example, did you have\Nan exhibit that focused
on something cultural?
Like the history and craft\Nof Paulownia wardrobe making?
-Seriously?\N-
Oh, honey, that sounds like\Nit wouldn't be any fun at all.
You're right, it doesn't.
I know it doesn't.
Okay, guys,\Nlet's take a break.
We're gonna be so amazing.
I can't wait to see\Neveryone's faces.
We still have a lot of work\Nto do before we're ready,
so let's stay focused\Nand keep working on it,
'til we can do it perfectly.
It's a good thing Hiiragi\Nis here to crack the whip,
or we'd never be ready in time.
Well, I didn't wanna\Ngraduate without doing
something special with you guys.
Awww!
What are you looking at?\NShut up!
\NOh, no, really?
Sorry about that,\NI didn't know.
No worries.
He said today is the rehearsal\Nday for the students only.
I guess they're still\Ngetting things ready.
And?
And he said that if we're\Nnot actually students here,
we're not allowed\Non campus 'til tomorrow.
I told you to make sure\Nwe can come here
before we came\Nall the way out here!
I know you did,\Nbut I heard that
Akira-chan was going\Nto be here today.
I'm sorry.
Oh, jeez, what a total\Nwaste of train fare!
We could have bought hamburgers!
I could have had a\Nhamburger in my stomach now!
Well, for an\Nunfinished haunted house,
yours is the best\NI've ever seen.
Very funny.\NWhat's with that outfit?
You're really gonna\Nwalk around like that?
I'm a walking ad for\Nour fortune-telling thing.
Well, I think Kona-chan's\Ncostume is really cute.
It's important\Nto have the right outfit.
I'm gonna tell a bunch\Nof fortunes today.
You will buy\Nsoft-serve ice-cream
five minutes\Nand 15 seconds from now.
You will drop it five minutes\Nand 28 seconds from now.
You're telling fortunes,\Nnot predicting the future.
Cut it out!
Wow, your costumes\Nlook fantastic,
but wait 'til you see\Nthe outfits we put together.
It was cutting it close, but\Nthey got finished just in time.
What do you think?
Wow!
That's so cute.
Those costumes are wonderful.
It's a little\Nembarrassing walking
around school in this outfit.
-Yeah, I can see why.\N-
I mean,\Nyou guys are super cute.
Senpai, it's almost time for\NAkira Kogami's show to start.
Oh, yeah, that's right.\NThis should be good.
My name is Akira Kogami.
It's great to meet you, ma'am.
I'm gonna do the best I can\Nto entertain everyone today.
Yeah, good.\NI'm Sakuraba.
Anyway, today's like some\Nkind of rehearsal thing,
so take it easy,\Nand I guess that's it.
Thanks. Oh, and break a leg.
Introduce yourself, Shiraishi.
Oh, sure. I'm Shiraishi,
chairman\Nof the arts festival committee.
It's a pleasure\Nto meet you, ma'am.
\NHe's gonna take it from here.
If you need anything,\Nask him, okay?
Great, see you.
Thanks!
-\N-
You gonna say something,\Nor you just gonna stand there?
Huh?
Shouldn't you be\Nat the monster's meeting?
-What the--\N-Is there a problem here?
No, everything's just great.
We just got carried away,
planning stuff\Nfor the show and stuff.
You're an important guest\Nfor the school, Akira-sama.
And I'm gonna make damn sure\Nyou're treated like one.
Now what?
If you're gonna sing "Misoji\NMisaki" in the Lucky Channel
segment tomorrow,\Nyou'll need to do a mike check.
And after the show tomorrow,
you're doing some kind of panel.
Great, that sounds\Nlike a piece of cake.
Then, please head on over\Nto the stage, thank you.
Yeah, right, you son of a--
-\N-Nice sign.
Hiya, luckies!
I wanna thank everyone\Nfor coming out today
to see little old me.
Are you guys ready to\Nhave bunches of fun today?
I know you are!
\NWhen will she get to feel
the arms of the man\Nshe loves caressing her?
She wanders the land alone now.
His last words,\Nher only companion.
Searching for the things\Nshe can never find.
Ladies and gentlemen,\NMiss Akira Kogami,
with her version\Nof "Misoji Misaki."
-\N-Okay, cut it!
Let me finish singing, damn it!
It's only a mike check!
Besides we're out of time!
-Who cares!\N-I can't hear you!
I'm gonna kick\Nyour freaking ass,
you stupid wannabe!
Okay, guys, you ready?
This is our last rehearsal,
so let's get it right.
I never really thought\Nthis cheerleading idea
was gonna turn out\Nto be anything special.
But I just wanna say I'm\Nhappy I have the chance
to do something cool\Nwith everyone.
Let's not worry about whether\Nwe do it right or not.
Let's just get out there\Nand have fun.
All right!\N
-\N-Oh, it was so much fun!
What's up, you guys?
Why are you all\Nstill hanging around here?
We were practicing\Nour cheerleading routine.
Oh, is it coming along okay?
Guess it's gonna be\Nawesome then.
How about\Nyou buy us a round, ma'am?
Huh? Okay, sure.
You guys have been\Nworking so hard,
the least I can do is\Ntreat y'all to a drink.
Yes, you're the best.
You really don't mind?
Of course, I don't.
It's my treat, 'cause today\Nis a special day for you.
But I want you to get that crowd\Npumped up for the festival.
Y'all got that?
Yes!
What's wrong, Tsukasa?
Huh?
Nothing's wrong.
It's just, well,
doesn't everything feel\Nsort of weird right now?
\NYes, it does, doesn't it?
I'm beginning to feel\Na little sad myself.
The best part of the\Nfestival is when everyone is
preparing their events\Nthe day before.
I guess tomorrow's gonna\Nbe the real deal, huh, guys?
Yeah, it is.
This is the last time\Nwe'll get to stay here late,
working on projects together.
Kind of makes you feel sad,
if you start thinking about\Nit that way, doesn't it?
Tamura-san,\Nyou don't look so good.
It's nothing,\Njust a little... nauseous.
Tsukasa,\Nrelax, you're all stiff.
\NSpeak for yourself.
You don't look like you are\Nready to do this either.
They say\Nthe more nervous you are,
the more focused\Nyou're gonna be.
Oh, but I think I'm so\Nnervous right now, I'm frozen.
-Check, check.\N-
Okay, folks, the Outou\NFestival is about to start.
The opening act is something\Nour exchange student,
Patricia-san, came up with.
-It's a cheerleading routine...\N-
...by her and her friends.
So put your hands\Ntogether and--
Could the person\Nwith the cell phone--
whoa! It's mine.
Stop, stop! Bad phone!
I knew something\Nwas gonna go wrong!
If I keep laughing like this,
I'm gonna pass out!
That was perfect timing!
He needs to get\Na better ringtone!
I feel so bad for him.
Well, I guess\NI shouldn't be surprised
this happened to us.
I know, that was\Ntotally random, wasn't it?
\NAnd for my next trick--
sorry about that, folks.
What? Yeah, here we go.\NLet's try it again.
Here's Patty and her friends\Nand their performance
of "Motteke Sailor Fuku"!
-\N-
\NLucky Star.
♪ So long in my dreams ♪
♪ She's a angel ♪
♪ No, she's a devil ♪
♪ I love you ♪
Okay, let's do this!
Sure. Let's go!
Grr!
Quit screwin' around and start!
On your mark, get set...
Wow! Kona-chan, that was so amazing!
You're so good at sports, and I always wondered,
how come you don't join a team or anything?
'Cause if I got on a team and started playing sports,
I'd miss all of my prime-time anime shows.
Hey, Tsukasa, which end of a choco-cornet do you eat first?
Huh? Um...
I think I start at the head.
Really?
So which side of this thing's the head anyway?
The fat part, or the skinny?
I always thought that this end of it,
the thin one was the head.
Oh!
See, I always thought the fatter end was the head.
So, why do you think the thinner end's the head?
Doesn't it look like a seashell?
Why do you think it's the fatter end?
I always thought, it looked more like a caterpillar.
A caterpillar?
Yeah, but when you think about it,
I guess a seashell's a much better image.
Um, you know...
There's another way to eat it.
Tear off the thin end
and dip it in the chocolate cream on the fat end.
Good idea!
Ah! It figures you'd know that.
You're so smart, Miyuki-san!
Well, not really. Everyone has their own way of eating one.
How about cream puffs? How do you eat them?
Huh? How do I eat a cream puff?
That's easy. I split it in half horizontally,
then I take the top half
and dip it into the cream in the bottom part.
Then, after most of the cream is gone,
I start eating the bottom.
I find that if I eat it that way,
it keeps the cream from spurting out,
and I have equal amounts of cream and pastry in each bite.
Huh...
What do you do about the ones
that have both custard and cream?
Do you have a system to eat those?
Do you mix the flavors together?
No, I don't have a system for those per se...
Wait, how exactly does one mix the flavors?
Uh, just asking.
When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake,
or a chestnut on top of a Mont Blanc?
Let's see now...
It depends on the amount of strawberries
that are sandwiched between the layers of sponge cake.
With the strawberries,
the whipped cream, and the sponge cake,
I pace it so that I can get a bit in each and every bite.
So getting to the strawberry on top of the cake
is always different for me.
Hmm. That's a solid move.
When I eat it, I always save the strawberry on top for last.
Sometimes I get so full that I can't eat it.
And other times,
someone in my family comes along and takes it away.
And that's why you should always eat your favorite part first.
Come to think, I've never seen anyone take
Kagami's strawberry away from her.
That's Kagami for ya. She's sharp.
Here's one. Can you eat the very last bite of an ice pop
without dropping it?
Wait, you drop it?
If you don't eat it the right way...
...it falls off, doesn't it?
Yes.
How you do it, Kona-chan?
I suck it off the stick.
Oh...
Or maybe you could just turn it around
while you eat it, like this.
Oh, that's a good idea.
And then there's soft-serve ice cream,
which I'm not very fond of.
Huh? Whats wrong with it?
I hate how you're always left
with an empty cone at the end of it.
You're right! There's never any ice cream left, just the cone.
I always try to push the ice cream
further and further down into the cone as I eat.
But how in the world do you do that?
While I eat, l do a push and shove thing.
A push and shove thing?
You try to balance everything out, don't you?
I suppose.
Oh, here's another one.
How do you eat curried rice?
Do you mix the curry with the rice?
No, but I do try to have equal amounts
of curry and rice left over for my last bite.
I like mixing it up. How do you eat it?
It all depends on the curry.
If I pour some sauce on it, or drop a raw egg on top,
then I mix it up.
You put sauce on curry?
Oh, yeah, it's tasty.
Do you put sauce on fried eggs too?
Nope, I put soy sauce on fried eggs.
Oh! See, when I use that, I use mayonnaise.
Mayonnaise on fried eggs but not on hard-boiled eggs?
Mh-hm.
You know mayonnaise is good with pretty much every egg dish.
You put it on curry too?
Mh-hm.
I put mayo on white rice and on beef bowls.
It goes good with that sweet broth.
Oh! And on parent-child bowls too!
You know how the chicken's the parent and the egg's the child?
And how mayonnaise is made from eggs too?
I just put a little blob of it on top
and I call that the Relative Bowl.
Hmm.
And I used to really hate natto beans,
but if I put some mayonnaise on 'em, I can eat 'em.
Ach, I can't imagine that.
Oh, but the tastiest thing has to be
when you put mayonnaise right on top of some soft-boiled eggs.
Even the fried eggs are half-cooked at my house.
Really?
Yep. That's just how my dad likes his eggs.
I guess it's because he always liked to suck on the yolk.
So, if you fry the egg too much, then the yolk gets too hard
and my dad can't suck the yolk out.
So, how do you eat chicken skewers?
What do you mean "how"?
Do you eat it right off the skewer?
Or do you pull it off with chopsticks?
Let me see.
When I'm alone, I'll eat it off the skewer.
but when I'm eating in public, or with company,
I'll use chopsticks to pull it off.
Yeah! And don't you feel weird
when there's only one piece left on the plate?
Yes, the last bite
certainly makes things awkward at the table.
And then it gets later and later and no one eats it.
It gets all dry and stale and it's not lookin' so tasty,
and no one really wants to eat it,
but they don't want to say anything,
and then the waiter comes over to take the plate
and you're like, "Woah, we're still eating that!"
In the end, we all go home without eating that last bite.
Oh, that's such a waste.
I feel sorry for it...
Oh! With Korean barbecue,
I feel sorry for the meat that's left on the grill
that turns to charcoal.
Well, at a Korean barbecue,
you're always eating and chatting at the same time,
so you get a little distracted.
And when you're grilling beef tongue with green onions,
that cooks really fast.
Oh, you're so right. It's already done cooking
by the time you flip it over, isn't it?
Wait, you flip it over?
Huh?
You flip it over?
You should never flip beef tongue with green onions.
Why shouldn't I flip it?
'Cause if you flip it over,
all the green onions on top will fall into the grill!
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You don't need to flip it over at all
You roast it on one side,
and the heat cooks it all the way through.
I get it. I guess I'll do that from now on.
You absolutely, positively never flip it.
Never flip it.
Ever.
Ohh...
Oh, which end of a choco-cornet is the head?
The fat end or the skinny end?
Such a bad boy!
What's with all the kidnappings lately?
I mean, these guys imprison girls
and force them to call them "Master" and stuff.
It's sick.
Oh...
I think it's about guys playing way too many
dating sims and erotic games. The master/slave thing
is a pretty common scenario, ya know.
Oh yeah, like you'd know all about that.
Wait, you're in the eleventh grade.
How do you know about erotic game scenarios?!
Lucky Star!
You're amazing.
You're always at the top of the class.
Huh?
Don't you have any faults, Miyuki-san?
It's a little embarrassing,
but I guess I tend to think about things too much.
So much that I end up spacing out.
I Sometimes cut my finger using the veggie slicer,
Sometimes, I'll trip on my feet and fall down.
Or a corner of my tote bag will get caught in the train's door.
Wow.
Woah, hold it. Miyuki-san, those aren't called faults,
People call those moe points!
Huh? Moe points?
Clumsy is sexy.
Kona-chan,
what have you been thinking this whole time?
How come you wear glasses? I mean, you're really pretty,
but you can only appeal to a tiny section of the fan base.
Ha. Appeal to.
Besides the whole popularity thing,
don't glasses actually make your vision worse?
How come you never switch to wearing contacts?
Well, it's a little embarrasing to admit
now that I'm in high school, but I suppose you could say...
...I'm afraid of contact lenses!
Actually, I'm pretty scared to put anything into my eyes.
I can't even open my eyes underwater.
Damn, she's a natural airhead.
A total cutie pie!
Hey, isn't that Miyuki-san over there?
Huh?
I wonder if she broke down
and decided to get some contacts.
I guess she's probably better off
with the glasses after all.
That must've hurt.
And she's like that naturally.
Kagami's staying home 'cause she's got a cold, huh?
Mh-hm.
But at least she's only got a cold and not the flu, you know?
Thankfully, I'm stupid,
so I dont have to worry about catchin' flus and stuff.
I heard that works with a cold
but I didn't know it was the same for the flu.
I thought the flu was the deluxe version of the cold.
You saying that colds and flus are two different things?
I-I guess I think they're different things.
Or maybe the aren't.
I dont know anymore. I'm kinda confused now.
Oh! The difference between influenza and a cold?
Mm, mm.
Let's me see now...
Influenza is a viral illness,
with many symptoms such as fever and muscle aches.
If it's not treated,
there's a risk of more serious complications.
On the other hand, the symptoms of a cold
are sore throat and a runny nose,
and the fever doesn't run as high.
Those are just a few of the symptoms
that differ from the flus.
Huh...
So, to answer your question,
yes, they are different illnesses.
Oh, really...
Oh, but then again,
colds and flus do share many common traits.
I guess one could say a flu is sort of a scaled-up version
of a cold, after all.
I knew it!
Hmm...
Why are you looking so serious, huh, Kona-chan?
Ah, it's nothin', just somethin' that's been bugging me
since our conversation this morning.
Huh? The one about colds and flus?
You didn't disagree with me
when I said I was stupid, did you Tsukasa--?
Wait, It's not like that! I didn't mean--
Hello, Konata-chan. Come in.
She came by to visit Sis.
Oh, thanks for coming to see her.
No worries, I'll just go up. Thanks!
Haha, Kagami sure is cute when she's sleeping,
isnt she?
How'd you get into my room? What are you doing here? Get out!
Huh? You came by for a visit?
All the way out here to see me?
Yup, that's right.
Oh, no. I appreciate the thought
but I'd feel terrible if you caught this thing.
Oh, this makes me so happy.
She's all worried about me
because of that new virus that's going around.
I thought the only things she cared about
were games and anime.
But now, this is so touching.
Hm?
'Kay, so, uh, I'm gonna copy that homework
we got the other day.
But you don't have to get up,
you cute little sleepy face, you.
Out!
Kagami!
Miyuki-chan's come over to visit you!
Okay.
May I come in?
Oh, I hope this isn't too much trouble.
Not at all, you should be resting though.
-Here's a little something. --Thank you.
I'm feeling a lot better now.
I took some medicine, so my fever's down.
--Here. --Wow!
You brought me flowers and fruit! You shouldn't have!
Come on, sit down.
Oh.Thank you. I will.
I had thought of coming by to visit you with Izumi-san.
Unfortunately, I just couldn't seem to find any time.
I'm sorry.
No, really, it's fine.
Ah! I almost forgot,
I brought you the minutes from the last committee meeting.
Oh. Well, thank you!
Have a look at it when you can,
but only when you're feeling up to it. There's no rush.
Mm.
There's that,
and I have the budget requests for each club here.
What else was there? Let me see now...
Let's see...
Oh, but you're not feeling well right now!
I should go home so you can rest.
Now this is what a visit should be like!
What do you mean? What happened?
Well, you know how Konata came by yesterday?
That's what happened.
Maybe that was just Izumi-san's funny little way
of showing you she cared.
Perhaps the bit with the homework was her attempt
at cheering you up, Kagami-san.
And maybe she was trying not to wake you up,
but couldn't help noticing you as you slept.
And that would certainly explain how she saw you sleeping.
I never would've thought of it that way!
Is this girl a saint or something?
Oh, I just realized,
I haven't seen Tsukasa-san today.
Morning.
Are you feeling any better today, Sis? You need anything?
Look at that.
My sister isn't even sick and she's more relaxed than I am.
Well, it's not like I'm always sleeping in this late.
Really! Today's like "spring sleep dawn" something or other.
Oh! By the way, good morning!
Oh, I know how that is.
Lately, even I'm having trouble waking up in the morning.
Yeah, I know, and I've been so sleepy lately.
Me too. It's especially warm out today,
so that doesn't help either.
Isn't it though?
You really can't help it.
Wasn't it warm a couple days ago during our break?
It was
When I woke up, it was just starting to get dark.
I spent the whole day sleeping. Can you believe it?
It's a good thing if you can rest up
when you have the day off.
Yeah, but the thing is, I was in my pajamas all day!
Oh! Like today.
I had no idea those were your pajamas?
Oh, yeah, there my jammies!
I think they're adorable!
Why, they don't even look like pajamas.
--You think so? --Yes.
Do you think it's okay if I wore them all day?
I think you could even go outside in them.
Jeez, would someone get to the punch line already?
It's gone up a little.
No, wait!
The bra that I'm wearing has underwires and extra padding!
That's why I'm heavier today!
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
I wonder how much that is in grams.
If I just subtract...
It's over. I totally screwed up!
I forgot I had a physical exam today,
so I wore my character-print underwear.
I'm so embarrassed now!
I'm still short.
How dare you look happier than the rest of us! Damn you!
Hey! I'm here, now.
Oh, hiya' Sis.
I Just thought of something.
You always come here to hang out.
What's the deal?
Don't you have any friends from your own class?
Unlike you, I have friends.
Are you picking a fight?
No, I just thought they were avoiding you, is all.
Why don't you worry about yourself for a change
and get to work on those social skills?
Social skills? What're you talking about?
See, even though I look like this,
I've got about a hundred friends.
Both my social and my bargaining skills are actually pretty high.
Oh, and I go to parties every night.
Huh?
And with my allies,
I strive to restore the light to the crystals,
rescue the kidnapped princess,
and save the world from ruin!
Wait, you're talking about a game!
Oh yeah, I haven't seen that guy in while.
What guy?
She's talking about one of her game buddies.
Mm. He's a warrior class character,
who wanted to improve his hand-to-hand combat skills.
He left to train somewhere else where's there lots of monsters,
but hasn't come back yet.
I heard from someone else that he's camping out
in one of the underground caverns.
I wonder if he's all right though,
being all cooped up down there like that.
Everyone's worried about 'im.
How do you get cooped up in a game?
Trust me, it happens.
I don't know, but by the looks of his login info,
he's been playing the game non-stop for days.
Cooped up in the real world too, huh?
Whatever, its the same guy in both worlds.
I always wanted to ask you guys this,
how'd the two of you become friends, anyway?
Tsukasa was about to be kidnapped
by some big suspicious foreign dude.
I just happened along, saw what was going down and jumped in!
I unloaded a front punch,
whirlwind kick combo attack on him
and rescued her from that creep.
Why does everything you talk about
revert back to gaming?
Hey, I was just doin' what any other
skilled martial artist would've done, you know?
I don't approve the use of hasty violence,
but you did save her.
The thing is that the foreigner
was just asking me for directions,
I couldn't understand what he was saying though
and that's when Kona-chan came by.
Wait, that's no good! How can you be so smug about it?!
Oh, that's right. It's that time of the year again, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
I just remembered that baseball season's starting soon.
Oh, do you not like watching sports and stuff, Kona-chan?
I sorta figured you'd love watching sports
because you're so athletic.
If a game goes into extra innings, it's guaranteed
to totally screw up
the late-night programming schedule for anime.
Or even worse,
they could end up cancelling the broadcast for that night.
It sucks when something you like disappears, doesn't it?
When do you eat the strawberry
on top of a strawberry shortcake?
Why do you want to know?
I was just wondering
if you liked to save your favorites for last?
I guess I save my favorite stuff for the last bite.
Although with strawberries, it depends.
Beef tongue with green onions, you cook both sides?
Beef tongue with green onions?
Hmm. It cooks pretty fast,
but i guess if you roast it on both sides,
it'll get done quicker.
You can't! The green onions fall off.
But you put the green onions on it
after the meat's been cooked.
But if you do that, the onions won't get roasted.
But the green onions are just a topping, aren't they?
Man, you just don't get it at all.
Wait, maybe you can cook it both ways.
Oh!
Which end of a choco-cornet is the head?
Is it the fat end, or the skinny end?
Hmm. The fat end?
Wow. Guess we agree on that.
You're kidding.
Okay, so which end do you eat first?
Hm. Don't you tear off the thin end
and dip it in the chocolate in the fat end?
Do you have any other friends,
besides us and the ones that you have in video games?
Oh, yeah, I used to have this really good friend
back in junior high school.
Oh, you actually had one.
Yeah, but I haven't talked her in a while.
I wonder what she's up to these days?
You know, I remember in our junior high year book,
she wrote that her big dream in life was to become a mage--
So, she was a geek too!
Lucky Star!
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
It's time for the first ever episode of Lucky Channel!
So throw your hands up in the air and say "yay!"
And a big hello to all the viewers tunning in!
I'm Akira Kogami, and I'll be your navigator!
And... I'm Shiraishi.
Who's that?
Just kidding!
Allow me to introduce Minoru Shiraishi.
He's going to be my number one assisstant!
Ta-da-da-da!
Yeah, well, I am Minoru Shiraishi,
and I will be Akria-sama's assistant from now on.
Howdy.
My, my, my! You're so tense, Shiraishi-san!
Come on now, you're finally on TV!
Loosen up you big stick in the mud, you!
Sorry, I'm just not used to this.
I know it's only our first show, but we've already got
bunches of letters from viewers just like you!
Okay! We got a letter here from a viewer
in Osaka calling themselves "I Love Berry-Kou."
"Dear, Lucky Channel, congratulations
--on your first ever episode." --Thank you, Thank you!
"By the way, I've got a question for Akira-san.
You are referred to as a Super Idol by everyone,
including yourself.
How much money do you make as an idol? Please tell me."
What I'm paid?
Yes.
You know, this question's kinda personal,
so maybe we should move one.
Yeah, you know,
what are you thinking asking a question like that?
A-Akira-sama?
Well, it totally depends on the job.
You know, some gigs are cheap.
Some are really cheap,
Either way, I get paid a flat fee from the production company.
So, who knows how much money
those guys are skimming off the top.
I've been in this business since I was three-years-old,
and every cent of my pay still gets direct deposited
into my parent's bank account.
So, all I get is a small allowance,
and, believe me, it's tiny.
Uh. Come to think of it,
Mama's been buying a lot of brand-name bags lately.
She couldn't be spending the money from this show already.
You vampire!
Just because Dad stopped sending money after the divorce,
you're going to suck me dry now, huh?!
What do you think I am?!
Some kind of Cinderella, or something?!
Huh? Oh, no, it's time for us to say goodbye!
I'm so sad now!
Please send us your questions and comments.
If you guys have idea or opinions about the show,
or if you want to tell me how much you love me,
start sending those letters, 'kay'?
Is there anything you want to add, Shiraishi-san?
Uh, right. So, I hope you guys tune in to see us next episode.
See ya!
I heard they're giving you a part in the show.
Is that right?
Huh? Where'd you hear that?
We don't karaoke together enough.
To tell you the truth,
I hardly ever go to places like this.
Come on, we've only got two hours,
so start singing, people!
Stop being so pushy!
Two hours is plenty of time.
I have to say, this sure is exciting.
It's so fun!
I like how after you sing, you feel really good.
Anyone see the catalog?
Catalog?
Yeah, the catalog.
The catalog?
You know, the thing with all the song numbers in it.
You mean this?
Right on! I'm going first!
Hang on... Wait, you just entered three songs?!
Yeah! It's way better if you load it up!
What song is this?
Space Iron-Men Kyoudain!
Ohh! We gotta start with this one.
I don't know this one.
Go for it, Kona-chan!
Konata-chan, this is too loud!
Turn down the volume!
How the hell does she know a song like this?
On the next episode of Lucky Star.
Konata here. I'm so sleepy.
How come on nights when you slept a lot,
you wake up even sleepier the next morning?
Kinda defeats the purpose
of gettin' a good night's sleep, doesn't it?
Next time: "Efforts and Results."
Look forward to it!
Okay, let's do this!
Sure, let's go!
Grr!
Quit screwin' around and start!
It's so stinky, y'know!
Stinky!
Well girls, Golden Week's almost over now,
were you two able to get done
with all your homework and stuff?
Um, I haven't finished yet.
You know how you just wanna play during these long holidays.
We're in trouble... aren't we, Sis?
Sorry, but I'm almost done with my homework.
But we've been playing this whole time...
Thanks for breakfast.
Can you help me with this problem?
If you can't figure it out, do you honestly think I could?
You're in college, aren't you?!
Do me a favor and wake Tsukasa up.
No... She won't wake up for me.
Honey, wake up already.
Dad sure is late, isn't he?
Yeah, didn't he have
a groundbreaking ceremony this morning?
Okay, Mom. What time is it?
--I'm home. --It's past noon!
Hi, Dad! How was work?
Good morning...
It's afternoon.
How can you sleep for so long?
Did you see the special finale of Love Apron last night?
No. Missed it.
I fell asleep in the middle...
You didn't see the end?
I can't believe you slept through the end of it!
This guy shows up outta nowhere with a red bucket on his head!
--Kagami... --Mm?
Miyuki-chan's on the phone for you!
'Kay!
I was wonder if you'd like to get together
to go over the answers on our homework.
Sure. That sounds like an awesome idea.
Kagami, Konata-chan's on the phone!
Yeah, so, do you wanna get together
to go over all the answers to our homework?
Wait a minute! You're just gonna copy all my answers, aren't ya?
'Kay, I'm here. Can I copy your homework now?
Man, talk about being blunt...
Fine! You can copy my homework if you want,
but if you don't do it on your own, you're still gonna
blow that exam we have coming up after the break.
I guess you're right...
In the long run, it's not gonna be good for me.
I'm good at pulling all-nighters before a test,
so I'm down with the copying action.
Do you even have a conscience?!
Hello, everyone.
--Oh, hi, Miyuki. --Hey, what's up?
Are you going to be studying with us as well, Izumi-san?
No, she's just gonna copy it.
You're kidding me?!
Haven't either of you done your homework?
Okay... What'd you guys do during the break?
--Let's see... --Hmm...
Hmm... I got 23 pages of math, 20 pages of world history,
and 30 pages of English to do...
I got a five-day break...
If I study for five, no, four hours a day...
Math takes 1.15 pages an hour...
Oh, no, I haven't done any homework today.
Let's see... I got three days left,
so I guess if I work six hours a day...?
-- --
Two more days...
If I work all day and night...
Well girls, Golden Week's almost over now,
were you two able to get done
with all your homework and stuff?
Yeah, so, do you wanna get together to
go over all the answers to our homework?
I wanted to get everything done. I even had it planned out.
Your plans failed.
Your resistance was futile.
You're worse off than her!
At least she tried her best and did it on her own.
No matter what anyone says, deep down, she's a hard worker.
But her accuracy's horrible. I can't bear it.
Horrible... just horrible...
So, were you guys able to have any fun during the short break?
I know you had quite a lot of homework to do,
and you also have that little midterm thing today.
Don't tell me you spent the whole vacation goofing off,
instead of studying!
Man, that didn't feel like a vacation at all!
Life's tough.
I just kicked back and played around the whole time!
Uh, Ma'am...
Yeah?
I kicked back and played around the whole time, too!
Hey!
I always thought they designed these things
so that you couldn't get the prizes.
Eh, kinda depends on the prize.
Some of these are supposed to be hard to get.
Really?
Whatever, I never felt like trying it anyway.
Oh, amazing!
Yeah, this little guy's an easy one to grab.
Really...
If it's that easy to get one, maybe if I tried it...
"...I could get one, too,"
is that what you were thinking?
No! What are you talking about? I wasn't thinking anything!
But I guess it couldn't hurt to just try this one time.
Go for it, Sis. You can do it!
Darn. I thought I had that one for sure.
Oh, bummer.
No way!
Why?!
A wise man once said that:
"A UFO catcher's someone else's piggy bank."
True words of wisdom.
What? Oh! Again?
Oh, no....
I totally suck at this game.
You've got really good rhythm, Kona-chan.
Nah, it doesn't have anything to do with rhythm.
Rhythm, coordination, problem-solving,
the skills you get from gaming are useless in the real world.
Looking at you, I don't doubt that one bit.
Wow, you're super strong.
Yeah, I know.
How much money does she spend on these things?
Izumi! Hm?
Has anyone seen Izumi today?
Hey, Miss Kuroi? I got a Miss Izumi on the line for ya.
Kuroi speaking. Why aren't you in class?
I'm sorry. I gotta take the day off.
I'm not feeling too good.
That's unusual. Did you catch a cold or something?
Nah, it's just the May sickness is all.
I feel sluggish, you know.
Hurry up and get down here!
Hey, we're going home now.
What's up, Konata?
Why are you stuffing all those books in your bag?
The exam's start tomorrow,
and that means I gotta take all my books home tonight,
so I can cram till dawn.
You never take your books to study?
You leave them here every day?
Unbelievable. Look, Konata, for one thing, there's no way
you're gonna learn all that stuff the night before an exam.
Eh, I've always made it through exams doin' it this way.
You're confident.
We'll see how long that attitude lasts you tomorrow.
Okay, I'm gonna return the exams you took the other day.
Not too shabby.
How'd you do?
Please don't ask, Sis, but I did the best I could, ya know?
How 'bout you, little miss all-nighter?
Totally passed it.
You aren't human, are ya?!
Lucky Star!
Blah... I don't feel like doin' anything.
Come on, we're all going home.
On the way home, you always end up hanging out with us anyway.
Oh, it's Comp-Fest!
And they're gonna be givin' out QUO Cards.
I gotta collect 'em all.
Right! Time to get a part-time job!
You're talking out loud to yourself again.
That's crazy. I've never heard of anyone using
a case of May sickness as an excuse before.
I understand where she's coming from though.
Well, they call it a sickness,
so the excuse is totally legit, isn't it?
Do you honestly think that's true?
--Yeah. --Ah...
What exactly is the May sickness anyway?
Miyuki, you wanna explain it?
Well...
By definition, May sickness happens after you've
accomplished a major goal, such as a college entrance exam.
Or if you've just gotten a new job.
It also happens when a relationship
that started in April doesn't work out,
or when you can't reconcile the life you wanted
versus the life you have.
The symptoms include lethargy, apathy,
and even a mild depression.
You see, if you just feel lethargic,
I don't think you can call that the May sickness.
Besides, all of us are still in the eleventh grade,
so it doesn't even apply to us yet.
I like the change of pace in spring.
I always do my best this time of year.
Oh, yeah.
I guess I can see your point, though.
I tend to feel a little blah around this time of year, too.
I dunno, it's like sometimes I don't even feel like
doing homework and stuff when I get home.
Yeah, I'm the same way!
I'm skipping the snide remark, I'm pooped.
-- --
What's wrong, Yuki-chan? Why are you sighing and stuff?
I'm a little embarrassed to talk about it,
It's like my phobia about contact lenses.
I'm afraid to go to the dentist, and I've put it off for so long,
that my cavity's gotten worse.
And now it's so bad that it hurts even I drink water.
But... isn't that... sorta normal?
I mean, I'm afraid of that, too.
But if you knew it was gonna get this bad,
then why didn't you take care of it earlier?
Well, even though I knew it was going to be tough for me
when my teeth starting hurting...
For some reason, you still don't want to go to the dentist.
Even after the pain starts,
you still don't want to go anywhere near a dentist,
you just put it off and try to bear it for as long as possible.
Are dentists really that scary?
I've never had to deal with them, so I don't know.
You've never been to a dentist? I'm jealous!
There's that distinct medicine you smell in the office,
and then the tension as you wait in the lobby.
I know! And the sound of those drills
drilling away in the back!
Change Getter!
So scary!
Maybe guys like going to the dentist more than girls do.
Why's that?
Don't they say that a drill is kinda like a guy's...
Dinosaur Empire!
I hear guys go totally nuts for battles between robots
that use drills for weapons!
Yeah, but I think they'd hate to have their teeth shaved off.
Know what? When you go to the dentist,
have you ever noticed how pretty
all the dental assistants and receptionists are?
Come to think of it, they are.
I wonder why that would be.
Maybe the person hiring them has certain aesthetic standards.
Beautiful dental assistants and drills...
The way you put it, I agree,
it does seem more geared towards men.
Then, what do you think a dentist geared more for women
would be like?
First thing they'd have to get rid of
would be that medicine-y smell.
And the chair they put you in should be
one of those puffy, reclining chairs with a massager in it.
Aromatherapy would be relaxing.
And you could also have a foot massage at the same time!
That sounds good!
And, if you were able to play games while
they were drilling on you, that would help to ease the pain.
It might be hard to play games then.
But it is a good idea to have something to distract us.
Like putting on some headphones,
and listening to your favorite tunes.
Yeah, good one!
That's a great idea!
Mm-hm!
But in the end, I still don't want to go to the dentist.
Me neither.
What the...?!
Now, what's wrong?
They're turning another one of my favorite series
into an anime, but the cast is totally different
from the one on the drama CD.
Really? I don't get what the big deal is.
Is this like an act of God or something?
Politics? Money? What?
I never got into drama CDs, so I don't care who's in the cast.
If the voices match the characters
in the original series, I'm okay.
But that's not how it works, Kagamin!
If you're used to listening to the drama CDs, it's weird when
you start watching the anime and all the voices are different.
See, it takes a long time before that weirdness goes away.
Huh?
But something good definitely comes outta news like this.
Yeah? Like what?
Drama CDs and anime.
You can enjoy two worlds with two different sets of voices.
That's two for the price of one!
You're quite the tough shopper, aren't you?
Well, guys, looks like Miyuki-san's left a nugget
on her plate, so it's up to us to figure out
who's gonna get to eat it.
How 'bout we have a staring contest,
and the winner gets to eat it?
What? That is so childish.
That sounds fun! Come on, let's do it!
I think Kagamin may have already won.
You say something?
Then let's begin the staring contest, right now! Buh-blah!
T-That's insane!
Amazing!
That didn't even look human!
Jeez, you guys, talk about overreacting...
I'm sorry I took so long, the bathroom was crowded.
Did I miss something?
Come on, show Miyuki that crazy face you just made.
No, I don't want to.
It was amazing, Miyuki!
You've never seen anything like this, ever!
Fine...
Isn't that totally amazing?
It'll come in handy for the special talent section
of your college applications!
Yeah, use it! Use it to apply to colleges.
I'm sure you'll get accepted!
Yeah... that's not really a compliment.
So I saw this report on TV about
how many books the average Japanese person reads in a year.
Anyway, they said manga wasn't good enough,
and that only normal books counted.
Isn't manga...
I wonder if light novels would count.
Huh? I don't know...
I guess it's okay if you counted light novels.
What about picture books?
Uhh... Mm.
They're called books, so I guess they'd count?
If you said Harry Potter and books like that are ordinary,
everyone who's into the fantasy genre would agree, right?
So, is there such a thing as an "ordinary" book?
Besides, they ended the whole report by saying something
about how the younger generation
is starting to turn away from printed media and stuff.
The thing is, we use the net
to look at all kinds of websites and blogs,
so, I think we actually read more stuff these days
than ever before.
Yeah, I kinda get what you're saying and kinda not.
Hey, guys. Are ya ready to go home?
Yeah. Almost.
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't go home with you guys today.
Huh? What's the deal?
Do you have to run an errand or something?
Mhm. I started a part-time job, that's why.
Huh?
Wait, she started a part-time job?!
Is the Comp-Fest that important to her?!
You know, I'm really surprised
Konata actually went through with it.
Me too. She really got herself a part-time job.
I thought that she was just kidding about getting one.
I wonder about it, though...
I'm more surprised by the fact
that someone actually went and hired her.
That doesn't sound very nice!
Well, for one thing, I'm having a hard time picturing her
being a diligent worker.
Good point, Sis.
I wonder where she ended up working.
Maybe she works at a bookstore. You know how she likes manga.
I wanna buy this.
Yeah, hang on a sec. I'm in the middle of somethin' right now.
Uh?
Got 'em!
I really hope she doesn't get fired...
How 'bout a convenience store?
I wanna buy this.
That'll be 498 yen, please.
Ah, you got the right amount...
--Wha...? --
Nah... Not there.
Maybe a fast food place?
Got a problem with my smile?
Maybe not.
Family restaurants are also outta the question.
Welcome...
I wonder what kind of job she got.
Yeah...
Maybe she's a traffic monitor?
Nah.
A video rental place?
I dunno...
An izakaya?
That's not it.
Pizza delivery?
No license!
Supermarket cashier.
Nope.
Cram school teacher.
You're kidding!
A bread factory!
Huh?
Let's see... Hmm...
Let's ask her tomorrow.
Hey, Konata, what kind of place are you working at?
Yeah, tell us.
Hm?
Oh... it's just your average cosplay café.
Ah. That's perfect for her.
Should she be working there?
Lucky Star!
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
Second episode! It's me, Akira Kogami, your host.
I hope you're all excited, 'cause I sure am!
And sitting right next to me is a wonderful young man who's
going to assist me on the show,
Mister Minoru Shiraishi! Ta-da-da-da-da-dan!
Uh... f-f-fuh...
I'm Minoru Shiraishi, Akira-sama's assistant.
I'm still really new at this, so all I'm hopin' for is that
you guys remember my name, yeah.
Clappity-clap, clap...
Now, I know it's just the second episode of Lucky Channel,
but we're already got tons of messages from you guys!
Yup! Tons and tons of messages!
You guys are making me super happy! Thank you!
It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
All this attention's because you're so popular, Akira-sama.
Ugh.
Uh... What?
Saw the show today.
Yeah?
--You were in it. --Huh?
The show, man! You had a part.
Oh, yeah. They did give me a little part.
Yeah... They did, didn't they?
Uh-huh. So, uh, what was the scene you were in anyway?
Sure! Um... It was Scene 45, Part A,
the classroom after vacation.
Right, right. Yeah, now I remember.
You came and went by so fast, I'd almost forgotten.
Yeah, well, I only had one line the scene, so I--
Bleh. You complaining or--
No! Nobody's complaining!
You should be thrilled those guys gave a newbie like you
a line in a scene.
Things were different when I debuted on the screen...
Oh really? How old were you when you made your debut?
Three years old.
Back then, I was ecstatic that they even gave me a crummy line.
But it's not about how many lines you get, after all.
Well, it was pretty tense for a while there,
being surrounded by the biggest names in the industry.
What an amazing experience!
Yeah, you were tense. I could tell.
Huh?!
You were stiff as a board. You looked like a total amateur.
Tell you what... I don't usually do this, but what the hell.
Come on, let's hit that scene together, you and me.
Uh, you mean like right now?
They might bring you back for another episode, right?
Yeah... I guess.
You have to practice your craft, man.
Listen, I'm offering to help you out here!
Oh, yeah! I got it, I got it!
Thank you, I really appreciate it.
The script, please.
So, which scene was it?
Scene 45.
Oh, yeah... This one.
Okay, I'll play Kuroi, the teacher.
Whenever you're ready.
Ready, and... Action!
"So, were you guys able to have any fun during the short break?
I know you had a q-q... quiet..."
That's "quite."
"Quite a lot of homework to do.
You also got that little midterm thingy today.
Don't tell me you spent the whole vacation goofing off,
instead of studying."
Man, that didn't feel like a vacation at all.
What was that?
What?
That totally sucked. There's no motivation.
The line didn't deliver.
Deliver?
Deliver here! Right here! I gotta feel it!
Oh... I'm sorry.
Hell, if you're just gonna say the line,
a monkey could do that.
But monkeys can't talk, man. I--
--Huh?! --Ahh!
I guess it's time to say goodbye now!
I think it's sad when happy times like this
go by so fast, don't you?
Well, anyway, keep on sending your questions and comments, and
please don't forget me! I need to know you love me, too, 'kay?
And we'll see all of you in the next episode.
See you later! Bye, bye, everybody!
Yeah, so, what are they like?
By "they," you mean...
The cast. Somebody's getting kicked off, yeah?
They hate each other, right? A buncha divas, right?
No, it's not like that. Everybody's pretty cool.
Then, why don't you help a girl out and--
Amazing, Kona-chan!
What a passionate performance!
Hey, Konata!
Are the next two songs gonna be like the last one?
I picked a couple anime songs
with a few from some live-action shows.
That's not the point!
Pick songs that the rest of us can recognize!
Hey, I can sing whatever I want, so chill out!
Fine... Whatever.
Hey, Tsukasa, punch some songs into that thing,
or we'll be listening to her warbling anime vocals all night.
I don't mind if she does.
Actually, this is kinda fun.
Miyuki, not you, too!
Sorry if I block the screen,
but I'm gonna do this one standing.
You really think that's gonna help?
It's harder if I'm sitting down,
'cause I can't use my diaphragm.
You're gonna sing even louder than the last song?!
Hey, footage from the show!
Wow, look at that!
This looks like a TV show
from way before we were born.
Okay, ladies, here are your drinks.
Oh, thank you.
Uh... oolong tea?
That's me. Thanks.
And the iced lemon tea?
Right here, please.
Who had orange juice?
That's me.
And the ginger ale goes to...?
Oh, yeah... Just, uh, right there. Thanks.
On the next episode of Lucky Star.
Kagami here.
Okay, so when I put 200 yen
in a vending machine to buy a can of juice
and get back a 50 and some 10-yen coins as change,
I think to myself, "Score!"
But then, when I wanna buy a 150-yen ticket for the train,
and after I put in a 100-yen coin,
I think, "Oh, I've got five 10-yen coins left!"
So I put in four,
but I only ever had four,
so now I'm one short.
So I end up putting in another 100-yen coin to buy the ticket.
And then I get back nine 10-yen coins as change...
and I feel so defeated, you know?
Next time: Various People.
Look forward to it!
Okay, let's do this.
Sure, let's go.
Grr!
Quit screwin' and start!
Oh, that's right.
It's time to wear the summer uniform.
I bet Konata's gonna show up in her winter uniform.
There's always someone in every class
who forgets the switch.
Good morning, Sis!
And that someone is my sister.
Oh, darn it!
I forgot to send my entry into The Tele
for that giveaway of theirs.
I was kinda hopin' to win that apron from Love Apron too,
darn it.
It sounds like you don't have enough love.
Huh?
You forgot about it because you don't have enough love
for the show.
Whatever, I've been really busy with all my committee stuff.
Besides, I also had to study for exams.
No, no, no, no, no.
Those are excuses.
I've never forgotten to send mine in.
Stop comparing yourself to me!
You got time 'cause you goof off all day!
Besides, the way you said that ticks me off!
Ah ha!
How does anyone win a contest like that, anyway?
One word, and that's love.
Whatever, I'm a woman with no love!
There it is!
Well, if you send in a normal-looking postcard,
you're never gonna win anything.
What do you mean, Kona-chan?
I design it so it'd get picked!
Design how?
The first basic step is neat penmanship.
Then you have to make a postcard
that attracts the attention of the person who's picking 'em.
For example?
For example, take a highlighter and draw a border
around the edges of the postcard.
Ahh, that makes it stand out!
Then draw a picture on it that's got something to do
with the prize you're trying to win.
A picture, huh?
Hmm.
But I can't draw too good.
Not to worry, Tsukasa.
Send in a bunch of postcards and overwhelm 'em with volume!
I know I can do that.
Although, if you do it that way,
you can't use a computer and you can't just make one
and make a bunch of copies.
You have to write each entry by hand.
And it's gotta be at least 100.
100?
Sure, it's normal to send 100 postcards.
That's gonna cost a fortune!
But winning takes lots of time and money.
Winning is all about how bad you want it.
Okay, but at this point,
wouldn't it just be cheaper to buy it?
You can't buy the feeling you get when you win something.
Can 100 postcards fit in a mailbox?
No, don't put all of them in the same mailbox.
You put a few in this one. You put a few in that one.
Just do that every day for a week.
Really?
Yeah, 'cause if you send in a stack of cards all at once,
whoever is choosing will notice and shove yours aside.
It's a sign of desperation,
so it's not a good idea to do that.
But sometimes it really pays off.
Then what do you think I should do?
Like I said, you need love!
Yeah, yeah.
Anyway, if you really wanna win stuff,
there's always those free handouts
or those flyers in newspapers.
Just keep your eyes open for the drawings that don't have
too big a following and you're set.
Then your chances of winning are pretty high.
I'm gonna try that.
Where's the love in that?
Hmm.
Hmm.
I just noticed something.
You guys look different, for twins, that is.
Of course. We're fraternal twins, not identical twins.
You can tell us apart just like ordinary sisters.
Identical twins look the same but fraternal twins
come from two different eggs,
so they differ in appearance and personality.
Oh, I get it.
That explains why Tsukasa's really laid-back,
and you're so vicious.
What'd you say?
You see?
Maybe if you do your hair the same way,
you'll look more alike than you'd think.
Kona-chan!
No way, Kagami can't do cute.
Oh, shut up!
And keep your kooky fantasies and comments to yourself!
Hey, are you guys telepathic?
Huh?
I heard that even if twins
are raised separately,
they end up having similar lives.
If they get married, they'll pick the same type
of people to marry.
I even heard sometimes twins marry other twins.
Weird, huh?
It's even weirder when one twin's in danger,
and the other one gets a feeling
something's wrong, even though the other twin's far away.
That's a whole lot of phenomena, isn't it?
So you guys have to be telepathic.
Come on, let's try it out.
Hokey-pokey--
Okay, you read way too much manga.
There is ManaKana.
ManaKana?
Yeah, them.
They said there were things about them that were different.
Like how Mana's the one who's really cautious,
and Kana's the one who's optimistic.
And they said that when they sing they can tell
their voices are different.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
ManaKana always thought they're from different eggs,
you know, fraternal.
But a little while ago,
they found out they're twins from the same egg.
What? They're identical?
Yeah, why are you so surprised about that?
I heard the definition of identical
and fraternal twins had been changed recently.
You think it's possible that you and Tsukasa came from
the same egg?
Let's see, how're you guys are the same?
I got it, both of you like sweets, right?
Yeah, I do.
Sure.
Both of you are also left-handed.
Yeah.
That's right.
What's your favorite color?
I like white.
Mine's black.
That would be the color of your souls.
What was that?
I guess all this talk about eggs and sausages
and stuff got me hungry.
We weren't talking about food.
Ugh, it's so muggy in here.
It's not even that crowded in here and we're sweating!
Guess it's that time of year again.
Hot!
I wish someone would turn on the air conditioning.
Ah!
Don't do that!
So hot!
Ladybug Samba, punk rock version.
So I just found out that a cousin of mine's
gonna be getting married this month.
Wow, she's gonna be a June Bride!
That's nice!
Tell me something.
How did such a wet and gloomy month ever become
synonymous with weddings and happiness?
Uh.
You're wondering why the month of June is
synonymous with weddings and happiness?
Uh-huh.
In Roman mythology, the goddess Juno,
where the word June comes from,
was regarded as the protector of women and marriage.
The Greek's version of Juno, Hera, was the goddess
of anything related to marriage and childbirth.
That's why it's said that whoever gets married
in June will be blessed by
the goddess and have a marriage
filled with happiness.
Oh.
Yeah, but isn't Hera supposed to be Zeus' wife?
Yes, that's right, she is.
I always pictured Hera
to be the jealous type,
'cause Zeus was always foolin' around on her,
so I'm not feeling the happy here.
When you get married,
do you wanna wear a dress or a kimono?
I'd really like to wear a dress.
It's what I've dreamed of since I was a little girl.
Hmm, maybe I'd like to wear a dress.
But I also think a kimono would be nice.
Hmm, I wish I could wear both.
They have miniskirts now and all kinds
of colorful wedding dresses too.
Wow, miniskirt wedding dresses.
That could be really cute if it had some kind of frilly
design on the hem.
So many dreams and so many frills.
Oh my.
Tsukasa's like Angel Salvia.
No, actually your hair makes you look more like Daisy.
So you should be wearing a miniskirt
and your top should be yellow.
Huh?
I think Tsukasa-san would look good in a miniskirt.
You do?
Sure, the outfit's important,
but the kind of person you end up marrying is too.
It could be a childhood friend,
or some girl from a rich family.
That's a tough decision to make 'cause
one's got the money and the ability
to cast magic spells like and ,
which always come in handy.
But if you're after true love--
Then, Bianca is the one!
Whoa, Kagami, when did you get so pure?
I thought you'd go for the girl with the money.
I'm out of comebacks.
Hiya, Konata!
Hm?
You know that game I borrowed?
I need help getting past this one level.
Whoa, not so fast there, Kagamin.
Don't you think it's more fun when you figure things
out like that on your own?
Hmm, yeah, you have a point.
You know it.
It's fun to figure things out on your own, uh-huh.
So I guess you won't be copying my homework anymore,
will you?
Hm.
You know those detectives in manga and TV shows?
Isn't it weird how they keep coming across murders
all the time?
Guys like Conan & Kindaichi.
If they didn't, they wouldn't have
any mysteries to solve, would they?
Really?
'Cause they could go after normal cases too.
Normal, how?
They could have a case where they run all over Japan
looking for a missing person.
Tracking someone down's got a lot of
game-like aspects to it.
It's got thrills. It's got suspense.
Yeah, I guess.
A case where a husband wants his wife tailed
'cause he thinks she's cheating.
Looking for a lost pet could be a case.
Yeah, right?
Yeah, but do you think it'd be any fun to watch that?
Well no, I guess it wouldn't be any fun at all.
You see?
You're right.
Real-life cases don't have the clever tricks,
bizarre situations
or show-stopping finales that the crimes in manga
and anime have.
Hmm.
You're right, they don't.
Like faking fingerprints, or scrubbing a crime scene
so luminol won't pick up anything.
Huh?
Making it so the forensics team can't solve it.
Well, the police don't want someone copying
the perfect crime,
so they censor that stuff from manga and TV.
Yeah, or maybe
perfect crimes happen all the time but they don't tell us.
Maybe they're never solved.
Ever!
Careful talking like that!
Someone might hear you.
Don'tcha hate how
there's been so much rain lately?
Yeah, I know.
I remember when I was little I used to like
rainy days a lot.
I never liked them 'cause if you go out, you get wet,
and then you can't hang your clothes out to dry.
How come you liked rainy days so much?
Because if it rained,
there wouldn't be any baseball on TV,
and I'd get to watch all my anime.
I should have known
you'd say something like that.
Yeah, but now they've got
stadiums with domes.
Lucky Star.
What's the matter?
You know how in manga and anime,
they've got really smart characters
and really stupid characters
and they're both going to the same school?
I've had enough outta you!
Shut up!
If you don't like it, why don't you get lost, you dork!
I always thought that was kinda strange, don't you?
I noticed something too.
The other day I watched this anime where the teacher
and the students all looked the same age,
and it was totally weird.
Heck, the teacher looked younger!
Uh, ma'am...
Yes, Tachina-san?
That's not surprising 'cause the world's always
had a fascination with stuff like that.
People who look young and act old,
or people who look old and act young. You know?
Uh, no.
You never question it.
You just go with the flow.
It's a lot weirder to have students
with different test scores
in the same class, don't you think?
You're right.
I couldn't agree with you more.
And since you brought it up, Konata, I was always surprised
that you got accepted to this school.
You're so good at pulling all-nighters,
maybe that's how you passed the entrance exam.
Wait!
Is that how she did it?
Nah, just kidding.
That's way too much work for an all-nighter.
Oh, thanks goodness.
I'm surprised you actually studied for it.
Did a new quiz game come out for the DS or something?
No, but my dad did give me a couple of conditions.
For a D rank school, I'd get a Pippin,
a C rank, a 3DO, and a B rank's a PS2.
Man, Izumi's dad sure knows
what buttons to push.
I just thought of something.
Huh?
Huh.
I'm surprised Tsukasa's
in the same school as us.
I can't believe you'd be so blunt about it!
K.O.
All right!
Uh, damn!
I can't beat her in a fighting game.
She spends too much time playing these.
Pick another game.
Even if it isn't a fighter, I'll take you on!
Oho, sure about that?
Then how about we play a quiz game next!
Ugh, you're kidding!
It's a lousy quiz game and she totally beat me!
No way.
Maybe she went and memorized
all the questions and answers.
Her memory's sharp as a tack when it comes to games!
So what are we gonna play next?
You in a hurry or something?
Hey, that's weird, where is it?
Didn't you used to have an easy party game
that you liked to play?
Hey, how do you know so much about what games
I've got in my house, huh?
Well, I just thought it was something
even you could beat me at.
Really stinky!
Hey, Kagami,
how come you're not eating any of these snacks?
Usually, you gobble 'em all up.
No reason, I just don't want any.
Oh, I get it.
You're on a summer diet, aren't ya?
No, I'm not.
It's nothing like that.
No one to show your bathing suit to anyway.
Shut up!
You don't need to go there!
Oh, that's right.
You guys were born on the Star Festival.
It's almost your birthday, isn't it?
Yeah, so what?
Oh, Kona-chan, you remembered our birthday!
Mm-hmm.
We're gonna be seventeen.
Seventeen's the year before the unlucky one.
What do you mean? What's gonna happen?
Seventeen's when unlucky things start happening
and it's right before the real unlucky year.
Uh-huh.
So now, with my seventeenth birthday coming up,
I'm getting a little worried.
I ended up buying power stones and talismans
to ward off evil and other stuff.
Well, at least you're having fun, right?
Yeah, right.
I bought so much, I got to the point--
Yeah, now that we have one of those reckless charms,
I mean, one of those cautious charms.
She said reckless charm.
She's all, "That's enough.
"Safe childbirth! Safe driving!
"Be careful now!"
Heh heh heh. Yeah, yeah.
Oh, that's right.
Did you guys know that your birthday happens
to be on Ponytail Day?
Uh-uh, I didn't know.
Why is July seventh Ponytail Day?
'Cause in the legend of the Star Festival,
Vega had a ponytail.
That's why.
Boy, that's stretching it.
And did you know that there's this thing called
the Japan Ponytail Association?
And that every year they pick a celebrity who they think
would look good in a ponytail
and give 'em an award for it?
Wow, I didn't know.
That's silly.
I mean, doesn't everybody look good in a ponytail?
Oh, you think so, huh?
Oh, I didn't think it would work with my hair.
How is it?
Great!
A small ponytail is really cute on you.
Kona-chan, you look great!
I think you totally pull off that look.
Yeah, you think so?
Mm, I really do.
Wow, you look so--
Yeah, you look so--
Okay! Fine.
It doesn't work on me.
I get it.
You look manly like a samurai!
Drop it already!
You know how drunks go around with their neckties
wrapped around their heads?
You guys have any idea why they do that?
Yeah, I do.
See, when a drunk loosens his tie,
he's gotta pull it over his head to take it off.
The tie gets stuck, and there you have it.
Oh.
What's even weirder are the drunks that stagger around
carrying take-out boxes.
What's up with that?
Take-out boxes?
You know, Kato-chan carries 'em in The Drifters.
I still don't get it.
That's the visual of the typical drunk.
They've always got the necktie around their heads
and they're carrying take-out.
I don't know why that is.
You see?
Vega and Altair.
I hope they meet this year.
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle.
I'm just hopin' that
your reckless charm works.
Yeah, whatever.
The Comp-Fest is in
the middle of a huge Quo card giveaway.
You know, you've been collecting those Quo cards forever,
but I don't think I've ever seen you use them.
Hm? Oh, I don't use 'em.
But, why do you collect them, then?
When something comes out that's related to
a show or manga you like,
don't you wanna have it, as a collector and as a fan?
Okay, but you're supposed to use those things, aren't you?
You can't use them, ever!
You have to store them someplace safe.
It really pisses me off when I see all those people
using those cards like common money.
These are sacred things.
They're meant to be bought and carefully archived.
You're not supposed to use 'em,
and it's out of the question to go and auction 'em!
If you do, you'll fail both as a fan and as a collector!
Okay.
Didn't think you get so worked up about it.
Here's how I do it.
I always get three cards for the collection.
First off, I pull the most pristine one
and lock it away for eternity in a special case.
The second card's for me to keep
so I can look at it every now and then.
And the third one?
It's a loaner.
You're kidding.
Kagami, isn't it human nature to want two or three of
something that you really, really like?
Come on, aren't you the same way?
Huh?
Uhh.
Fine, whatever. So you don't.
I'm an otaku.
I'm totally weird.
I'm a weirdo.
No, I, I didn't say that.
I think I sort of know what you're saying, I guess.
Tsukasa, you seem like the type
who'd be popular with boys,
but I never hear 'em talk about you.
She's kinda on the plain side,
so she doesn't really stand out.
Mm.
I think it's 'cause she's got a scary sister guarding her!
You say something?
Maybe it's not because I'm plain.
Maybe it's because you guys and Yuki-chan are more unique.
Yeah, that Miyuki-san, she sure is smart and pretty.
She's got an awesome figure!
She wears glasses, she hates the dentist,
and she's clumsy in a cute way--
Hey, you're getting
weird on us again.
You know I've never heard any rumors about Miyuki either.
Maybe guys are scared to talk to her
'cause she's so pretty.
Oh, I doubt that.
She's totally nice and gets along with everyone.
I guess you're right.
Hey, maybe she gets asked out all the time.
And then she turns all of them down?
I don't know, maybe she does.
Maybe she doesn't even know she's being asked out
when they ask her.
Oh, that might be it.
You know, Yuki-chan's sort of clueless,
so maybe guys need to be more direct
when they ask her out.
I swear!
Your class has gotta be filled with a bunch of
scared little boys.
You're telling me that there's not one of them with the guts
or passion to go up to Miyuki and ask her out on a date?
I don't think so.
Maybe what the school needs are more maniacs in class.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, girls like Miyuki-san
are much more appealing to the maniacs.
Maniacs, huh?
Oh no!
I didn't realize it was already this late.
Sorry, but I think I have to go now.
Oh, already?
Yes, I'm sorry,
but don't mind me. I'll see you later, okay?
Well, I'm off then.
Have a good rest of the day!
Later!
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.
So here's the end of the story.
This guy got up and then he--
Huh?
Oh no.
Excuse me!
Yeah!
I'm so sorry.
Eh, don't worry about it.
Yeah, that always happens!
It's no big deal.
Even I've done it before.
I've done it too.
See, it happens to everybody at least once.
You've done it too, right?
Never. Uh.
And that, Kagami, was an example of moe-ism.
Miyuki-san, good job, girl!
Lucky Star.
Lucky channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
Yeah!
It's time for more super fun on Lucky Channel!
And I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami, and--
Oh, and I'm Minoru Shiraishi, Akira-sama's assistant.
How's it going?
Yeah, sure.
You know, today's a really special day
because it's officially...
Ta-da!
Our third episode together!
What do you think, Shiraishi-san?
Are you getting the hang of it?
Yeah, no, not really.
I'm sorry.
Aww.
Looks like Shiraishi-san's having a hard time opening
up to me, and that makes me really sad!
You're even sitting further away from me than usual.
Huh?
Guess this means you don't like me anymore.
Sob!
Whoa! Hey, that's not true!
Look!
Scoot.
Hi! I wanna start this episode with a twinkle today!
You see, we're gonna start doing something
that'll make all you fans out there happy!
That's right!
Today's our first installment of Lucky Star
featured character introductions!
Bom bom bom bom!
Yes, today, we'd like to introduce you to
Miss Miyuki Takara.
Let's see.
She's a class committee-chair. She's beautiful.
She's gentle and kind. She's kanullabul?
Knowledgeable.
Knowledgeable, good at sports and super human, too.
Shiraishi-san, you know a lot about Miyuki-san, don't you?
That's right, I know all about her.
She's a really nice person.
Besides that, she wears glasses,
which makes her even more pretty, as you can see.
You know, when someone's as beautiful as she is,
you feel like you can't really approach her.
However, she's actually very easy-going
and will talk to any--
Wow, it would be nice
if you were that talkative on my radio show.
Uh.
Ugh, you just can't stop talking about that girl, can you?
Well, uhh, I know her, and I was just telling everyone--
Sure you were.
Miyuki-san was it?
Miyuki with the pretty face,
Miyuki with the big boobs.
Every fault's an aspect of moe.
Ohh, I'm so jealous.
Come to think of it, don't the maniacs go for her type?
Sure, she's got the maniacs,
but I've still got my pedophiles so take that.
Oh no!
It's time to say goodbye, isn't it?
I hope you had a super happy fun time!
We wanna know what you think about the show,
and I wanna know what you think about me.
So, send those cards and letters, please?
Yeah, well, we hope to see you again next time!
See ya later!
Okay, so what's she really like?
Well, like I described her.
Oh, please.
You mean she's not backstage burning through
a pack of smokes every 15 minutes?
Oh, no,
she's not like you, she's--
Uh-huh.
That was so cool.
It certainly was a unique song.
I'd like to hear a song
that normal people know.
Oh, you'll know
the next one, Kagami. Promise.
Huh?
Intro's comin' up!
Try to guess it.
It's not gonna be
another weird song, is it?
Hmm, what is this?
I don't know.
Kagamin, your answer please.
Oh, FMP, Full Metal Panic!
Oh.
And it's your
favorite version, Kagamin. Fumoffu!
Oh, really?
No, I just read the book
and got a little.
Kona-chan, you're good!
She has such
a mature singing voice!
She's just
impersonating the singer.
So, how about you guys?
What are you gonna sing?
I'm not sure if
there's anything I can sing.
I don't think
I know any of these songs.
Like it matters!
Come on, Konata's gonna be singing this stuff
all night if we don't pick anything.
Pick something!
Okay, I'll try.
I'm not confident about my singing though.
It's all right.
We're the only ones listening,
so just pick a song and have some fun!
Really?
Okay.
On the next episode
of Lucky Star...
Tsukasa here!
So, um, the other day I laughed so hard
I couldn't breathe.
I thought I was gonna pass out.
And the next morning at school
I'm out of time?!
Next time, A Question of Motivation!
Look forward to it!
Okay, let's do this!
Sure, let's go!
Grr!
Quit screwin' around and start!
Anyone wanna tackle this problem?
Shiraishi?
Aww, you made me do the last one.
Really?
Then, Izumi.
Izumi!
No, I wasn't sleeping.
I didn't say you were, you have a good nap?
Oh no, I forgot my English textbook!
Then just go borrow Kagami's.
She already had English today, didn't she?
Jeez, what's with you?
How could you be so careless?
Yeah, I know.
Check your bag before coming to school.
Tsukasa forgets stuff all the time, doesn't she?
All the time.
But now that you mention it,
you never forget stuff like textbooks, do you?
I have to say, when it comes to things like that,
I'm pretty reliable.
I never take my textbooks home, so there's no worries.
Yeah, see what I'm saying?
That's not being reliable at all.
If you leave your books here,
then you can't study the stuff
you learned in class that day.
But I never study at home, so what's the point?
Yeah, you take your books home to study
the night before a test, blah, blah, blah.
But Kona-chan's really good
at pulling the all nighters.
That's it, I bet that's the reason
I always forget to do my homework!
Hello, it's not that you forget
to do your homework, you lack the motivation to do it.
Speaking of homework, can I see today's stuff
for Japanese class?
See what I mean?
I just thought of something.
If you're in the same class as Miyuki,
why don't you ask to see her homework?
Yeah, how do I put it?
Miyuki-san's such a good person,
that it just doesn't feel right asking her.
It feels kinda weird, you know?
You sorta get what I'm saying?
Yeah kind of, that's a pretty weak excuse,
if you ask me.
Izumi. Izumi?
What, is she late again?
No, stop, hold it!
I'm here, I'm not late!
I'm late, but I'm late cuz
I was helping someone out!
Oh.
It's someone I hang out with all the time,
but today I couldn't just get up
and leave 'em like that 'cause it's not right!
Kay.
So then he said no worries I'm cool,
let's disband, but I can't,
cuz if the other five get what they want,
and that one guy's the only one
who couldn't get it, that sucks,
and I kinda feel guilty, cuz that's not cool, you know?
I mean when you've been hangin' out with people
this long you're supposed to back 'em up.
Yeah, havin' friends is a good thing, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
So I guess you spent all night gaming it up online,
is that it?
Kept playing after I logged off, huh?
Izumi, Izumi?
What, is she late again?
No, stop, hold it!
I'm here, I'm not late!
I was walking past the strip mall
on my way here and this girl bumps into me,
and all of a sudden she grabs my hand,
and starts running.
She tells me that she stole a piece of taiyaki
and is on the run!
I'm running and listening to her,
and I'm thinking she's nuts!
So we're running, and I'm thinking,
"Why me?"
But she's holding on to me and I'm stuck,
and we duck into this cafe to hide
from the owner of the taiyaki shop.
There's so many places in that story to nitpick!
But I can't do it!
As a teacher, as a human being.
Oh, I caught a summer cold.
Hey, Izumi, is something wrong with you?
Yeah, I'm really sorry, ma'am.
But I need to take a sick day today.
Haha, you were up all night gaming, huh?
Used the sick excuse before, so it ain't gonna work.
No, I really am sick this time--
Don't tell me,
"I got a summer cold."
The rainy season's over now,
and the weather's great.
So get out of bed and get to class!
She didn't even believe me,
she treated me like I'm the boy who cried wolf or somethin'.
Well, you reap what you sow.
You feeling any better today, Kona-chan?
I think my fever's gone down,
but my throat still kinda hurts.
Oh, I know why that is,
it's cause you breathe through your mouth.
Huh?
Huh what?
Well yeah, everyone breathes through their mouth,
but you mostly breathe through your nose, don't you?
Yeah, but Kona-chan probably
breathes through her mouth way more than her nose.
Hmm?
I mean, you know how when you got a throat cold,
it's cuz the cold virus got in through your mouth?
And if you get a sinus cold,
it's cuz it got in through your nose.
So you figure anyone who gets a throat cold
is a mouth-breather cuz that's how the virus
got in their throat, get it?
How about we let Miyuki-san handle stuff like this?
-Yeah. -Okay.
It's hot.
And I don't feel like doin' anything.
Hello, Kagami.
How about we have your birthday party
over at my place today?
It's so hot right now I can't move a muscle.
Aww, that sucks,
I was just baking some cookies too.
Coming.
Cool, see you in a bit.
Come on in.
Happy birthday, Tsukasa,
and the other one with the longer hair.
I have a name!
Happy birthday, Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san,
I hope you like the flowers we brought.
Ohh, thank you.
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
I know it's not much,
but I saw these and thought you'd like them.
What is it?
Oh please, open it!
Oh, they're matching earrings!
I couldn't decide on what to get,
but I thought those might look great on you!
You two are gonna flip,
when you see the presents I got you.
What is it?
Go on, open it.
What's this?
A brigade leader armband.
I knew you'd love it.
Jeez, Konata,
why do you think I'd wear something like this?
Aww, come on, Kagami, just put it on!
I think it'd look perfect on you.
It's more your style.
Um, what's this?
To Heart?!
It was really expensive, too.
Take care of it when you wear it.
Hey, stop trying make both of us cosplay!
Oh, it's not that different from our school uniforms.
That could be a problem.
Well, if it's too big.
I know, and what if it's stinky too?
You know, it's our birthday.
You think you could ease up on the cookie-eating?
I can't help it, Tsukasa makes the best cookies ever.
Oh, glad you like 'em.
Actually, I helped her bake those this morning.
Yeah, she taught me a lot.
So what's wrong with you?
I dunno, but suddenly I'm thinkin'
that a few of these cookies
aren't as tasty as some of the other cookies are.
What was that?!
Is this one of your cookies, Kagami?
Is anyone ready for a slice of this yummy cake?
That's our Kagami, a hard worker.
But only on her birthday.
Shut up.
By the way, when you guys cut the cake,
do you end up arguing about it?
Huh? 'Bout what?
The cake, I mean you're cutting all those slices.
How do you decide who gets the strawberry on top?
And which one of you gets to eat
the little chocolate thingy?
You've always loved eating the chocolate sign,
right, sis?
My slicing's off today.
It's not moe when she's clumsy.
Wha'd you say?!
Thank you for the food.
Thank you for the food.
What's wrong?
My strawberry's so small.
What's the matter?
Do I have cake on my face or something?
I think I just found another
charming quality about Kagami is all.
Stop talking like him, okay?
Can you believe summer vacation's almost here again?
You're right, it is.
The beach, the pool, summer festivals.
Anything else that we absolutely have to do?
Screech.
There's only one festival that matters during summer:
The War Zone in Ariake!
No matter what, it's gotta be Comiket!
No, no, no, no no, no no.
That stuff's only for you!
War Zone?
Well, I guess there's something for everyone to do.
Some people like to visit their relatives, right?
Good morning, everyone.
Hi, Miyuki.
Hey, what do you do every summer vacation?
Well, let me see.
There was talk about vacationing overseas again,
we'll probably do that.
Again? Did you say again?
Damn bourgeois!
Isn't that yogurt?
When you said you started working at the Cosplay Cafe,
I was kinda surprised.
Don't those places only hire girls with amazing figures?
Yeah.
I know, my lack of breastiness
is something that's always really bugged me.
But in this game, they were saying that a flat chest
was a status symbol, and how it's considered rare.
And when you think about it,
there's probably a demand for that kind of thing.
I'm quite the valuable commodity.
I wanna know how a line from a game
can make you so confident.
Then maybe I'm valuable too?
Finals are coming up,
and here you are playing games all the time.
You should be studying, you know?
If only you could somehow channel your passion
for gaming into studying more,
your grades would be so much better.
If a game could influence her that much,
maybe if there was a game that promoted studying,
it would turn her into a genius.
There are those moe quiz games.
What's wrong?
Hasn't there been an awful lot of teenage crime lately?
I know, and when it happens,
they always ask the neighbors about it,
and they say something like:
"He always seemed to be a nice boy,
"he didn't seem to be the type that could do that."
Well, then that's all the more reason to be careful.
You can't tell what someone's capable of,
until they snap.
Although if you ever did something horrible:
"I always knew deep down,
"she'd do something like this,"
is exactly what I'd tell everyone.
It's so hot.
It's so hot, I don't feel like doing anything anymore.
I know what you mean.
It has been hot lately.
Then again, you've always got one reason or another
for not doing anything, doncha?
Lucky Star!
Hello there, Kagami.
Hey, so how's the studying coming along, huh?
Yeah well, I was just cleaning up my room.
Huh?
You know how when you've got somethin'
important you have to do,
but you get this urge to clean up instead?
Yeah, I get it.
Go study.
All right, time to get some studying done.
I think I'd better take a 30 minute break.
I'm starting to lose my concentration.
Aww, time's up already?
30 more minutes, just 30 more minutes.
Oh.
Oh yeah, it's almost time for Haruhi to start.
Click.
Talk about cutting corners,
Nagato just sat there the whole time.
Man, that guy's not really doing it for me anymore.
Whoa, that's right guys.
Let the flaming begin.
It's two A.M.
I'd better stop for today.
I'll just sleep a bit and wake up early.
If I get up at five, I'll get three hours of sleep.
Then I've got the whole morning to study.
After all of that, I ended up watching anime,
and reading my manga all night long.
Oh, that's just like you.
That's one thing about you Konata,
you've got strange tastes,
when it comes to anime and manga.
You only read the stuff guys like,
and you play those dating sims.
Well yeah, it's probably cuz
my dad likes that kinda stuff.
So, go figure, it's rubbed off on me.
When I was little, I'd sit next to him,
and watch him read and play his games.
I get the manga part,
but what kind of father plays adult-oriented
dating sims with his daughter sitting there?
Ew.
If both you and your dad are into that kinda stuff,
what does your mother think about it all?
Oh, my mom's been gone for a long time now.
Yeah, I never told you,
but my mom died when I was really young.
I'm so sorry.
I guess it means I can do the household chores
better than anyone, even you, Kagami.
How can you go off on a tangent like that,
after you've brought the mood down?
I bet you're a really good cook, Tsukasa.
I dunno if I'm all that good,
but I do love to cook.
I wonder how good Miyuki-san is at cooking.
I bet because she's rich, she's probably awful
at doing the housework.
Oh, do I know how to cook?
Actually, I only help out around the house
every now and then.
So I'm afraid I'm not very good at chores and things.
I'm ashamed to say it.
See, told ya.
Yeah, but Miyuki's so good at everything else,
you can't possibly compare her to any of us.
She's just being modest when she says
she's not good at something, that's all.
Hmm, I guess you're right.
That's not true.
I just thought of someone else.
How about our teacher?
She says she lives alone,
and I always got the impression that
she'd be a total slob.
What are you talking about?
These days, anybody can get by,
without knowing how to cook.
You've heard of convenience stores, right?
I'm kidding, I do all my chores!
I cook and clean as good as anyone!
Please don't joke,
when your joke doesn't sound like a joke!
Tsukasa hasn't given my dictionary back yet.
Tsukasa?
Sorry, but can I have my dictionary back?
I was just cleaning up, cuz I figured, I would?
You too, huh?
Hey, whacha thinkin' about?
They want everybody who's workin'
at the Cosplay Cafe to come up with new stuff
for the summer menu.
Really, they make you guys do that?
Wait, you haven't stopped studying for the exams, right?
That's it, since it's hot out,
how about we have somethin' hot and spicy,
like an ultra-spicy ramen?
How about coming up with something
that you'd actually order in a cafe?
An ultra-spicy parfait!
Do you think you could stop and think for a second,
before you answer a question?
I can't stand up.
Could somebody tell my why our school
doesn't have a swimming class?
We have a pool, don't we?
I hate to admit it,
but I'm glad we don't have a swimming class.
Huh, why is that?
Remember how I told you I couldn't open
my eyes under water?
I can't swim very far because of that.
It's so embarrassing.
Your weaknesses are your greatest strength,
it's so unfair!
That's right, this summer's ComFest
is just right around the corner!
Oh yeah, the only reason I went out
and got myself a job was for ComFest.
A festival, and with it, so many memories.
Why'd you pull out an old reference like that one?
Well, when you're excited,
and everyone around you's getting excited,
don't you get the feeling you make each other
that much more excited for the festival?
If you could only focus a tiny bit
of that passion on your schoolwork.
I can't get to sleep.
I guess I'll read a book, maybe that'll help.
I just bought this, it'll do.
I didn't get any sleep, and it's already morning.
And now I'm tired and ready to go to sleep.
Figures.
Stare.
I know I'm supposed to turn off my cell phone
when I'm next to the priority seats,
cuz it's got somethin' to do with pacemakers and stuff.
Mm hmm.
But I don't get why we're not allowed
to talk on our phones anywhere else on the train.
Well isn't it because when you do that,
you're bothering everyone around you
with your conversation?
Hmm, I guess.
But aren't trains filled with people
that talk too loud, even when they're not on the phone?
I'm talkin' both men and women.
Well yeah, I guess that's true.
Do you guys do your New Year's priestess thing
at the shrine during summer too?
Nah, we don't do that kinda stuff in the summer.
And you know, I still can't believe
that it's already that time of year.
I know, what are you eating?
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?
Yeah, that.
Well, I guess with all the studying I've been doing,
I got on the scale yesterday,
and I'd lost a little weight.
So I figure, why not, you know?
Woah, don't tell me you gave up.
Good morning.
Good morning, Kona-chan.
Hey, what's the matter, Kagami?
Konata!
It's my weight again, I gained it all back
in like the blink of an eye!
That's cuz you let your guard down,
and ate too many snacks.
Hey, wasn't that a Senryu?
You're making such a big deal out of it,
you don't look any different,
if you gain a kilo or two.
Why bother getting excited or freaked out
about each kilogram anyway?
This is one of the reasons why girls are so--
Hello, you're supposed to be a girl too, arencha?
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hi Luckies!
Lucky Channel's back,
and I'm so glad to see you guys again.
So have all of you been doing well?
I'm Akira Kogami,
and I'll be giving you 120%.
This week I'll be--
Just kidding, I'm Minoru Shiraishi,
the assistant.
Hey.
Don't you ever cut me off again!
I'm so sorry!
This isn't kid's play,
so learn how to handle yourself.
Like a professional.
Or maybe you don't want this job anymore.
No, no!
I'm really very sorry.
I promise you, I'll do my best!
Okay, today we've got, ta da!
Really super important news
for all the Lucky Channel fans out there!
If you picked up the November issue of
Comptiq, you'll know all about Akira's
fashion project.
You were supposed to send me a postcard,
and you did!
A whole lot of postcards!
Uh, you know, I think there was someone else
involved in that project with you, wasn't there?
Thank you so much for sending in your entries!
I am mammoth happy!
I don't think I know that reference,
is it from the 80s?
Now I'm gonna single-handedly
pick the one idea out of all the amazing
entries you sent in.
This'll do.
Let's see, this is from a Miss Cherry,
who lives in Saita City, Saitama.
Akira Fashion Project!
On Lucky Star, Kagami-san looks super cute,
in her pigtails, why don't you try
putting your hair in pigtails too, Akira-san?
Oh, pigtails, huh?
Oh, yeah!
You're right, Cherry!
A girl loves long hair more than anything!
And if she puts her hair in pigtails,
maybe if I did that it would look cute too.
I dunno if that's a good idea.
Your hair's kinda short.
Pigtails'll make you--
Yeah well, it's not like having long hair
is better or anything, right?
Don't sit like that.
Long hair weighs you down.
It takes forever to shampoo, you know that?
That looks passe these days anyway.
You guys are always goin' off about how much
you like the long hair, but if you think about it,
hell, you don't know a damn thing.
If you could just come back to topic?
You don't know how much time,
how much money, how much effort goes into maintaining--
-Hello? -Nobody notices.
It's time to say goodbye, isn't it?
Oh well, if you guys are wondering
how I'm gonna look in pigtails, don't worry!
Go to my website and take a peek!
And don't forget my radio show!
I hope you guys tune in, kay?
Please keep sending those letters!
Yeah, please look forward to the next episode.
So what's up with the attitude?
What attitude?
You kept snapping at me, what's that?
Did I piss you off when I corrected you or something?
No! I didn't think they'd recognize
Nouri peace speak from the 80s!
Huh? Eh?
Huh.
Look, I'm really sorry.
Let's just forget about the whole thing.
You know-- Yes?
They're auditioning for Minoru Shiraishi.
You're kidding?! Nope.
When'd this happen?!
You should try out.
What are you talking about?!
Break a leg.
But I'm the real guy!
Huh? The real what?
Whuh?
Kona-chan, you're amazing,
you can sing anything!
As long as it's an anime song.
I think you sing wonderfully,
and in different voices too.
It's the number one rule,
that when you sing a song from anime,
you have to do it exactly like the original singer.
Really?
All right, my turn now.
What are you gonna sing, sis?
Her title came up a little while ago.
But I don't know the song.
Miyuki, you don't know this song?
No.
Practice what you preach, right Kagami?
Eh.
Oh, I heard this one before.
Well yeah, we've been watching the show together.
Oh, I forgot.
I like the movie better than the series.
Yeah, whatever, old man!
Hey, she's good.
Yeah, out of all our sisters, she's the best.
On the next episode
of Lucky Star:
Hello, it's Miyuki.
Did you know that Golden Week
is a term the motion picture industry came up with?
Apparently around this time,
there's an increase in movie-goers.
Next time, The Famous Shooter.
Look forward to it.
Okay, let's do this!
Sure, let's go!
Grr!
Quit screwin' around and start!
Well, starting tomorrow,
you guys get to have a nice, long break.
Don't forget you're still students,
and behave like the good little boys
and girls I know you are.
Okay!
I don't know why,
but you students get antsy around this time of year.
Then y'all get bored and go out
and cause some trouble.
And as your long-suffering teacher,
that makes me very worried.
Please behave, and don't cause any problems.
Got that?
'Cause if you guys get all delinquent out there,
you're gonna ruin my vacation!
Behave yourselves, I'm begging you!
This isn't good.
Yay, we're officially on vacation now!
And the best thing about it is
the fact that I won't have
to see your face each and every day.
Come on, sis.
You know, I just realized that even though
I'm on vacation, I'm still gonna
see our teacher every day.
Why?
You taking an extra class or something?
No, we're both in the same party
in this net game.
Yeah, of course you are.
Net game?
Our teacher's a wiz, and I'm a tanker.
When the two of us team up, I'm the one
who's gotta pull the monsters.
It's a pretty sweet deal in terms
of cash and XP.
It's nice, she's got my back,
but I'm always the one running around.
All she has to do is click AoE skills the whole time.
Check this out!
The other day, I pulled a ton of mobs,
but Teach went and fell asleep at the keyboard.
It took me all day to get my XP points back.
Ugh, try speaking a language we understand.
Good morning.
I can't believe how hot it is, can you?
I know, amazing hair by the way.
How 'bout we turn
the air conditioning on?
Jeez, there you go.
Don't be so quick to rely on stuff like that.
Use a fan or something and suck it up.
Here.
Ahh!
You're right, a fan gets it pretty cool, too.
Yeah, see?
But I'm still hot.
You get so tired fanning,
and you know how when you stop fanning,
you feel even hotter than before?
Yeah, well, yeah.
Good try, though.
This is so much fun,
we're all wearing yukatas!
Mm-hmm!
Well, I know it's kinda like cheating,
but our obis are the pre-tied kind.
They're much easier to put on.
Yeah, putting on a kimono or yukata's
hard enough, you know?
You have a proper tied-up obi,
don't you, Miyuki?
I'll bet you even tied it yourself!
Oh, no, actually, I had the person
at the shop tie it for me.
Tying something like an obi would
be much too difficult for me, to say the least.
I heard that.
Hey, aren't you wearing a proper one, too?
I didn't expect that.
Mm-hmm.
Did someone at the store tie it up for you?
Nope, I got my dad to tie it for me.
Oh, really?
C'mon, let's go!
How come her dad knows how to tie an obi?
Hey, Konata-chan!
Huh, who's that?
Are you in trouble with the law?
That's Yui nee-san, she's my cousin.
Nice to meet ya!
I hope you're behaving yourself today.
Make sure you listen to what these older girls say
and get home early, okay?
No, no, no, no, no.
Konata isn't an average girl,
we're all in the same grade!
No, all of us are in the same grade!
Really?
I'm so sorry, I couldn't tell!
I mean, they're so much taller than, you know.
Yeah.
No worries!
I'd tell ya,
kids these days, you guys sure do
mature awful fast, don't you?
No, like I said, Konata isn't
a normal girl.
We're the normal ones, lady!
Oh, look, it's a shooting gallery.
Hey, Yui nee-san, I bet you're good at this stuff.
Well, the truth is,
I'm so good, all the guys back at the station
call me Sharpshooter Yui.
In three seconds, I can shoot five rounds,
and blast a peace sign on the face
of a paper target.
Here, show us how awesome you are.
That's a rifle!
I have to use a rifle?
I didn't know.
I only ever use pistols.
Go, go, shoot, shoot!
Hey!
What's with the goofy poses, Narumi?
You know you're still on the clock!
You're on patrol, so patrol!
Okay then...
Hey, mister, how does this work?
If we hit a target, can we pick one of those prizes?
Anything you hit, you get.
It's all good.
Anything?
Yup, anything you hit.
Hmm.
Whoa, lady, I'm not the prize!
Lower the gun and back away.
At a summer festival, you can't forget the shaved ice!
It is hot, let's get some!
Okay, here we are.
I'm lookin' at all these flavors.
They've got strawberry, lemon, melon.
Wait, what the heck's a Blue Hawaii?
What kind of flavor is that?
Well, it's Blue Hawaii-flavored, I guess.
Of course, I figured you'd say that.
What do you think, Miyuki-san?
Do you have any idea what a Blue Hawaii is?
What's a Blue Hawaii?
Uh, lemme see...
Perhaps it's a song,
♪ Blue ♪
No, blue.
I don't really know.
Sorry I didn't know the answer to that.
I'll look it up when I get home, okay?
Mm, yeah, sure.
It is possible that--
Yeah, no, the person who wants to know
should be looking it up, not Miyuki.
Umm,
I think I might know about that Blue Hawaii thing.
Hm?
Yeah, I heard somewhere that the name
and the flavor come from this blue-colored cocktail.
I also heard that it's called the Blue Hawaii
'cause it's named after the movie Blue Hawaii.
So that's where it comes from!
That was a good reference.
Hee-hee.
Man, when Tsukasa's the one teaching me something,
I end up feeling like a total loser!
I just noticed I only have a little bit of money left!
Tsukasa, nothing is cheap around here.
Think a little before you spend your money, I swear.
Come on, Kagami,
it's a festival.
You spend a ton of money here
'cause you get caught up in the vibe.
Yeah, I guess.
Same thing with Comiket,
you don't think you're spending a lot
on doujinshi, but that's the illusion of it!
Then you're like, "Whoa, I'm broke!"
I'll never understand
the world you live in.
You get up early to stand in line,
and getting from the west hall to the east hall
is like a hike and a half.
Yeah, I still don't understand!
Cotton candy's so fluffy and sweet,
I really love it.
You're not a little kid anymore.
Slow down, or you'll be sick.
I don't know, I never thought doing that
with another girl was that much fun.
Don't go there.
Would it be too much to ask
for a little romance in our lives?
We're at a summer festival wearing yukatas!
If this was a dating sim, chances are
one of us would trigger a flag somewhere.
A flag?
There'd also be an event scene,
'cause we're outside wearing yukatas!
Wow, okay horndog, we got it.
Is there anything you wanna play, Kagami-san?
Hmm, now that you mention it,
I'd kinda like to do some goldfish scooping.
I haven't even tried anything and they're running away!
Maybe it's because deep down in their fishy hearts,
they know you're totally vicious.
The ugly truth has been revealed at last, mm-hmm.
Ooh, look!
There's one, you see it?
Oh yeah, I see 'em!
Okay.
All right!
I got one, I got one, yeah!
Yay, sis!
Don't worry, little guy.
I'm gonna take good care of you.
Hey, I knew I'd see you guys!
I heard there was a festival thing
going on around here,
so I thought I'd swing by
and check it out, you know?
I really love festivals!
So, did you come here
with your boyfriend or something?
Of course not, I don't have a boyfriend!
There isn't even a tiny bit
of romance for us anywhere, is there?
Surprise, surprise.
Well, well, we meet again.
Looks like you're having fun with a new friend.
Howdy!
Huh?
Wow, this girl looks like she hit puberty super early!
Girl?
Nope, wrong, she's our teacher.
I'm so sorry, I totally jumped to conclusions
and thought you were their classmate.
Nah, it's okay.
This is my cousin, Yui nee-san.
She's a cop, but I guess you figured that out.
Yeah, and because today's the summer festival,
they've got me on duty, pounding
the pavement out here.
Can you believe they make us work in heat like this?
Work?
Looks like you're having fun.
Are you working today, too?
You know, like, making sure your students
don't cause any trouble?
Nah, I was bored, so I'm just wandering around.
Oh, I'm so jealous!
If I was off duty right now,
I'd be wandering around and having fun, too!
Looks like you're already having
enough fun as it is!
So, are you on your own today?
Yeah, just me, myself, and me.
That makes two of us!
Huh?
Lucky Star.
I'd recommend balsamic vinegar,
but if you don't have that,
you can use rice vinegar.
Balsamic vinegar?
Balsamic vinegar.
Balsamic vinegar.
You know how during summer vacation,
you get really, really bored because
there's nothing to do?
You sorta get used to being super lazy.
So, if you're too busy being lazy
and doing nothing, you won't be asking
to see my homework.
Ah!
I know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, it's really cute how it's kinda
pudgy and all rollie-pollie and everything.
I mean, it totally looks like a frog, doesn't it?
I know, it does!
Uh huh, oh!
So it's depleted uranium, that's amazing!
Oh, hey, if I'm on the phone too long,
I'll get scolded.
Yeah, okay bye!
I was talking to Kona-chan, and I asked her
why you get bored during summer vacation.
You know what she said?
Mm-mm.
She said she wasn't bored 'cause she was busy
playing all the games that stacked up during school.
I guess some people know how
to have a fulfilling summer vacation after all.
Maybe I should go do something, too!
Yeah, well, I guess that's okay.
But do your homework!
As long as you do that.
Oh man, same old story.
I'm gonna pull one.
De-buff 'em, okay?
Oh, that's cool, Teach just logged on.
Hello.
You're online a lot, is it because of vacation?
I have some time, you wanna go hunt things?
I'm in the cave over by Chopalan Village.
You got it, I'll be waiting near the gate.
Huh?
Ma'am, could you not talk about
real world stuff every single time
we meet inside the gaming world?
Now she's scolding me, just like Kagami does every day.
Hey there!
It sure is hot out.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Come on in.
Hello.
Hey, you guys got the fan out today!
Well, like you said, it's hot.
Hang out and enjoy the breeze.
Yup, I knew it.
I totally knew you were going to do that.
Good morning!
Oh, Kona-chan's here.
What up?
Oh, you and your good mornings.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
Oh well.
Isn't it hot, though?
What, you too?
Come on, everybody does it.
Well, I don't do it.
But Kagami, weren't you doing it this morning, too?
Told ya.
Busted by dad.
It looks like Comp Fest is really popular.
What is that?
Each time you buy a manga or one of these magazines,
you get an entry ticket.
Then, if you fill 'em out and send 'em in,
they'll send you a limited edition quo card.
Really?
Every time I take my manga up to the cashier,
it's like I'm possessed or something.
You were saying something about
this quo card stuff the other day.
I swear, the Japanese are helpless
when it comes to giveaways and limited editions.
That's why when you buy something like that,
you always get one for the vault,
one to look at, and one to loan out!
Yeah, but you're talking about how you handle it!
It's not like everybody thinks the same way as you do.
And sometimes I forget who I loaned it to,
and then I gotta buy another one.
So don't forget.
So, do you think I could take a look
at the you-know-what?
Oh, homework!
Jeez, fine, I'll teach you all the stuff
you don't understand,
but you're gonna have to do the rest of it by yourself.
Balsamic vinegar.
Kagami, I don't know this one.
Oh, with a problem like that, you just...
Kagami, I don't understand this stuff
from here on down.
Oh, close one.
Kagami--
You're not even thinking about it, are you?
But I am thinking about it.
Are you really?
Yeah, and I don't understand any of this stuff
from here on down.
Then you aren't thinking about it!
She never taught me how to do these.
It's me!
Came by for a visit.
Yui nee-san, right on time.
Could you show me how to do this problem?
Huh?
What's that, your math homework?
Sure, I'll help you do it!
Yeah, well, seeing as how I'm supposed
to be a role model,
you shouldn't rely on others for answers,
because it won't do you any good!
Huh?
Homework sucks when you don't understand the questions.
Whether you get it or not doesn't matter,
just scribble down whatever seems right.
They just want you to turn it in on time, see?
Oh, I get it!
Awesome.
But then, this strategy of yours sorta goes against
the stuff you said before.
If I do it this way, it's not gonna do me any good.
Yeah, well, that's how I always did it.
I'm so tired.
I think I'll take a break
and go online for some hot gaming action.
Half an hour of hunting should perk me up again.
Half an hour's not bad, not bad at all.
Oh, a rare drop, no way!
Labatine, I've never seen anyone
with one of those things.
An ultra-rare item!
I got Labatine!
Okay, come, come!
I need to try this sucker out, but where?
Cool, everyone's really excited!
I should go get us some high-quality potions,
then pass them out to all the guys.
But I'll need to go back into town first.
We're gonna get fizzy!
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hi, Luckies!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
Can you believe it?
Lucky Channel's on its fifth episode!
And I'm so excited, I can't hold it in anymore!
Let me introduce my assistant,
who's getting lots of face time on the show
and getting a big head because of it!
Nah, I'm just kidding.
The one and only Minoru Shiraishi!
Clap, clap, clap, clap.
I promise my head's not gonna get any bigger.
Anyway, folks, it's an honor to be here,
and I hope I do well.
I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
Now, as you know, we get a ton of letters
every week from fans just like you.
Today's hand-picked letter was sent
by a U.S.S Gatoh in Tokyo!
Is this guy some kind of or something,
I mean, he sent in, like, 50 of those things!
He's probably just some poor, pathetic loser!
Anyway, here's what the letter says:
"Big hellos to Akira-san and Minoru-san.
On Lucky Star, I always see Konata-chan
go online to play net games,
so I was just wondering, Akira-san,
do you go online and play games, too?
By the way, online I'm what you'd call
a net-gay, but I don't swing that way
in real life."
Wow!
Someone's got issues!
A net-gay?
What does he mean, net-gay?
Is that short for network game?
I never play those things.
You're better off not playing 'em, Dorothy.
That was blunt.
Uh, why do you think that?
'Cause there's tons of people
who get so hooked they totally give up
their lives in the real world.
Betcha didn't know I used to be that way.
Whenever I had time, I'd log on
and go on these super-long hunting sessions,
or I'd just PKK some people.
Yeah, but that's when I was younger.
When you were young-er?
I mean, those terms you were using,
I didn't understand any of them.
It's better if you don't know 'em.
Whatever, it's not like the audience
is gonna understand any of this stuff either.
Yeah, anyway, you used to play those things.
Maybe you could, y'know, share some memories
you might have had as a gamer with our audience?
Oh, right!
Here I go!
Memories!
When I was just a beginner,
I didn't understand anything and got into some trouble.
Then these guys who were experienced gamers
came and helped me out.
Then they pitched in and gave me lots
of really expensive armor and super-rare stuff!
I was the happiest girl in the world!
I'll bet you were.
I had so much fun, I totally want everyone
to go online and start playing now!
Oh no, it's time to go!
Bye, nii!
Yeah, well, see ya next time!
So, I guess you're popular in the world
of online gaming.
Uh, Akira-sama, something wrong?
On page 38, scene 12...
Uh-huh?
Who the hell is Yutaka, dammit?
You're getting mad about that?
My name's Akira, damn you.
Akira! Right, I know--
Who's in charge?
Where's the director?
Get the director!
Get the producers!
Akira-sama, you have to calm down.
--I am calm. --I beg you!
--I got an idea. --Yes?
Let's take the name Minoru Shiraishi,
then we turn it into something else.
Something like--
You're so cool, Kagami.
Ah, thanks.
Tsukasa, Miyuki, who's gonna go next?
I am!
Again?
Give someone else a chance!
You can't hesitate,
we're on the clock here.
Time's money.
Sorry, I'm still looking
for a song I know, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's okay.
Let her sing, it's a good way
for us to kill some time.
Oh, I know this song!
I didn't think Konata'd pick
a song from a popular show!
On the next episode of Lucky Star:
Konata here, when I started playing Monster Hunter Dos,
the rule was that you had to defeat
at least five geanos to use a weapon, right?
So, what did I do?
Yep!
I went back to the village and had the gathering hall
offer me the quest.
But even after I defeated the five geanos,
even when I picked all the snow mountain grass,
even after I got all that popona tongue,
I couldn't go back to the village.
That's when I realized I couldn't access the storage box,
so there I was, getting boned on reward points,
and it's all because I didn't read
the user's manual!
I couldn't save any money.
Kinda makes you wonder if that's
how the real world works, doesn't it?
Next time, fixtures of summer!
Look forward to it!
Okay, let's do this.
Sure, let's go.
Grr!
Quit screwing around and start!
Summertime! Beach time!
Before we leave, ma'am, I want to make sure
you and my cousin are okay with driving and supervising.
Oh, yeah!
That's interesting.
Hmm?
You guys must have a lot of time on your hands.
Grr!
Sorry if we're taking you away from your day off.
Oh, no, it's totally cool.
Narumi-san, is it true you're a police officer
in the traffic safety division?
That's right! I'm the expert when it comes to traffic laws.
-He passed me. -Huh?
Damn him!
Hey, wait, you're supposed to be a cop!
She goes nuts when
she's behind the wheel She's out of control.
And we just sacrificed Kagami and Tsukasa to her.
Oh, come on now. She's a police officer, right?
Hmm? Hey, that's weird.
They were there a second ago.
No, Teach, you're going down the wrong street!
It says one-way, look!
I can't believe I got it wrong both times. Curses!
♪ Ah, yeah ♪
♪ Yo, yo, yo! ♪

The blue car's amazing! Who's driving it?

It's speeding up! Did the brakes die?
No way!
What's with her and her bleeping-D driving?
Nanako-san, you're a good driver.
A really good driver.
Huh? You think?
It's funny, but I always get motion sickness
when riding in cars.
Today, I brought along some medicine that would keep me
from getting sick. But you see, Nanako-san,
because you're a skilled driver, I didn't get sick at all!
Huh?
What am I doing talking to you? We gotta get outta here!
Okay.
Guess we should find a hotel.
Wow!
It's so sunny outside.
It's perfect for swimming.
I swear, yesterday I didn't think we'd ever get here alive.
I'm going to put my swimsuit on
and wear it down to the beach.
Sometimes you can be so childish, Konata--
No way, you can't be serious.
Hey, aren't you a little old to be wearing
your school swimsuit in public?
Not if you're catering to special interests, Kagami.
Whoa, how old is that thing?
Hey, do you really need one of those tubes?
I mean, you're so athletic and I know you can swim.
Just because I know how to swim doesn't mean
I have to jump in and start swimming marathons.
There's a thing called leisure, you know.
Sweet leisure.
Since I'm trying to meet the needs
of folks with special interests,
I'm using this thing 'cause it completes the outfit.
I don't think anyone with special interests
would go to the beach.
Hmm.
You always see people splittin' watermelons in manga
and anime, but it never happens in real life.
Naw, I've seen that happen before.
Maybe people think it's a waste of food.
You got a point.
'Cause when you blow up watermelons with a shotgun,
you get pieces of watermelon all over you.
You watch too much anime.
Miyuki-san, you're rich, have you ever split watermelons?
I can't say I've ever done that.
Hmm, on second thought, I guess I can't really picture
rich people doin' that kind of stuff.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Oh.
Hmm. That figures.
Nothing happens in real life the way it does in manga.
I'm so sorry I disappointed you.
So it's like, you know, whatever. Man, it's so sad.
Here we are at the beach and we have to babysit.
We're a couple of lonely single ladies.
-You got it all wrong. -Oh, yeah,
you could compromise and lug something
like that around, but that's no fun.
Give me a bunch of girls and I'm a happy camper.
-You know? -But I'm not--
I hear more and more folks are getting married later in life.
Guess you and I've got all the time in the world.
-Know what I'm sayin'? -You got it wrong.
The only reason that I'm here is because my husband and me
have a commuter marriage. I'm married, married!
If the beach is a mecca for pickin' up girls,
how come no one's pickin' us up?
It's better this way, 'cause no one's bothering us.
Besides, with you and your outfit, the guys probably think
we're sisters on vacation with the parents.
- -
Yokkoi Shouichi!
What's wrong?
Oh, you know, doesn't it feel kinda gross to sit down
when you're all sopping wet?
I know how you feel.
Maybe you should get into an air chair pose.
She doesn't need a workout.
Hmm...
-What's wrong? -My neck's tired.
I see.
Yes, I totally knew it!
What are you getting so excited about?
We've just been served food that's the epitome
of the beach house experience.
Check it out, runny curry. That's what I'm talkin' about.
You're right.
Isn't it weird how the things you'd never eat in everyday life
become amazingly delicious
when you eat them in a place like this?
Woo-ha!
Chugging beers at the beach is awesome!
Who cares if it's lukewarm? This stuff's the best.
Yeah, but they're pushing it
when they charge you 300 yen for a lousy hot dog.
Yeah, right? The thing's almost raw,
but who cares? You still eat it anyway.
I kinda like how when you order the fried chicken,
it's always really greasy and it's got way too many spices.
The plain fried noodles also seem to be
much more delicious here.
Hey. Does the food here really deserve all the hype?
Uh-huh. But it's not as cool
as running down the beach in a loincloth.
That supposed to be another anime reference?
I'm so hammered.
Looks like we're spending another night here.
Is that okay, Yui-neisan?
I've got another day of vacation.
It's cool, I'm fine.
The water's really cold.
Oh, come on, ma'am, it can't be that cold.
You're just exaggerating.
Lucky Star.
- -Oh.
Why does your hair always feel so squeaky
after you've been swimming in the ocean?
Well, maybe it's got something to do with all the salt
in the water. Right, Miyuki?
That's true.
It's mostly caused by the salt and also by the ultraviolet rays
from the sun.
But is that really such a bad thing?
Your hair's always exposed to UV rays anyway.
That's also true, but do you really want me to explain it?
Because I'm afraid it's quite involved and lengthy.
Mm-hmm!
All right!
The reason your hair becomes damaged at the beach is due
to exposure to UV rays as well as salt and seawater
and ocean breezes.
When exposed to these elements, your hair loses moisture.
Furthermore, if you sunbathe under strong UV rays,
the melanin in your hair begins to change,
causing your hair to lighten.
If salts or impurities, such as chlorine from swimming pools
remain in your hair for any length of time,
it causes your hair to turn brittle.
UV rays and impurities are the main cause
of follicular damage during the summer season.
However, the factors I've mentioned also cause
significant damage to the hair's cuticles.
So, when exposed to strong UV rays, the cystine bonds
that preserve your hair's strength become--
Hey, guys, lookit.
♪ Timotei! Timotei! Timotei! ♪
What the?
Sometimes I wonder how the other folks see us,
when they see us.
I don't know.
Another short conversation.
I guess they probably think we look like family
or something like that.
Yeah, I guess.
That's all you've got to say?
Yui-neesan, look!
♪ Timotei! Timotei! Timotei! ♪
No way! I used to do that too!
Bitchin'! That's just the reaction I was looking for.
How old are you, kid?
Mmm! Mandom.
Enough with the bad puns, Gramps.
What's wrong, Kona-chan?
Looks like I just triggered a flag.
What are you talking about?
An event scene is gonna happen.
Remember, if you want to see all your choices at the end,
save often.
I've going in, girls.
Picture's complete.
That's perfect. Bring it.
I had no idea.
You're such a geek.
No wonder today was so totally boring.
What do you mean?
Did any guys hit on us today?
It's not like I-- You're the one who brought it up.
I wasn't obsessing about it or anything, I was just saying.
That's why I brought up.
Oh, now I get it.
You wanted someone to hit on you.
No, that's not it.
- -
Oh, no, I missed it!
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
I was just wondering what you did with unwanted hair.
Well, I'm kinda smooth all over, so I don't really do anything.
Oh.
What do you do?
Ah! Who me?
I guess I'm kinda normal.
Hmm.
Actually today was kind of risky for me, if you know what I mean.
No, I don't.
It was almost time for my...
- -...you know what to happen.
Oh, I get it.
But it didn't, so that's good.
Were you okay with yours today?
Mm-hmm, it missed me.
Mine ended just last week,
so I guess you could say, it was perfect timing.
It's such a hassle when you want to go to the beach.
Yeah, I know.
It sucks when you can't go in the water because of it.
But you could always use one of those thingies.
Yeah, right, but you still worry about it.
I've never used one of those things.
-Hmm. -
Someone's having a blunt conversation.
What if we are? It's not like you never--
You're kidding!
What are you lookin' at?
Oh, nothing.
The story I'm about to tell you
really happened.
A man who worked for a video software wholesaler left work
one night as he usually did.
It was especially dark that night
as he got on the bus to go home.
This man lived on the edge of town
near where the bus route ended.
One by one the passengers were dropped off, but the man,
he was alone, riding through the inky blackness
on this especially dark night.
The bus so was empty and so quiet now,
the driver thought he was alone, but he wasn't.
And then...
...he sang "Danzen! Futari Wa... Cure" in a really loud voice!
Anyhow, that's the way I heard it.
- -
Huh?
Oh.
Oh, wow, wasn't that a scary story?
Yeah, actually it was...
I'm Sukekiyo!
Where the hell did you get that thing?
Good night, sleep well.
Okay, then, good night.
Inugami clan!
I love scaring Tsukasa.
Go to sleep, already.
Hey, let's bail!
Oh, okay.
I don't have anything
funny to say now.
I'm Tsukasa. I'm Tsukasa.
-Kagami! -Huh?
-What's wrong? -It was so scary.
I believe the girl has taken another step on the path
toward womanhood, Kagami.
Huh?
Man, this year's Comp Fest is gonna be huge.
The Japanese are suckers for limited edition stuff.
If labeling stuff as limited edition is enough
to boost sales, they should slap it on everything.
Well, if they did that, it wouldn't be limited, would it?
Though we asked around,
and the truth is that if you drink...
Don't forget, girls, make sure to clean up your rooms
before your vacation ends.
Wow! Cool! It's my old junior high textbooks.
Hey, sis, look. Check out this old photo album.
Look at this weird picture of Dad.
Yeah, when I saw that,
it made me wonder about his thing.
You guys look like you're having fun.
How's the cleaning going?
Let's see.
Hey, do you want these clothes?
Oh, yeah, sure, I'll take them.
Okay, I'll leave them here.
Thanks, sis.
Hey, you want this?
Sure, if you don't want it.
How about this? And this?
Wait! Is she using me
as her trash bin or something?
You always end up flipping through
old photo albums instead.
Yeah, I know, I know.
When I find an old magazine, I can't help but read it.
That's just what I mean.
Hey, where's Tsukasa?
Oh, you know my sister.
She has a hard time throwing anything away.
She's still cleaning.
Yeah, she seems like the type who totally keeps everything.
Although, you seem to be the type who throws everything away.
You know, this negative image you have of me is really
starting to piss me off, girl.
Wow, you kept all of your junior high textbooks?
What, you mean you didn't keep yours?
Oh, no, I left all of that stuff behind along with my memories.
No, take them home.
You're causing trouble for the school.
At last, I finished my cleaning.
Even though there's stuff I know I'll never use again,
I remembered the times I did, so now I can't throw them out.
Well, that's just the way some people are.
They want to keep everything.
You're that type of person, Tsukasa.
You seem to be the type who'd toss stuff that could be useful.
I mean, you still leave all your textbooks behind.
Miyuki, you know you really should go and get
your teeth checked before school starts up again.
I know that I should.
It's just that I don't think that I could.
Well, if that's the case, I'd feel really bad making you
head all the way down there.
If you can't go to the dentist,
we'll just have the dentist come here.
No, please, wait a minute!
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
Time for the sixth episode of "Lucky Channel."
Can you guys believe it?
I am Akira Kogami and I hope you guys are getting used
to this segment 'cause I sure am.
That's lame.
Did you say something?
Oh, well, it looks like my assistant, Minoru Shiraishi,
still isn't used to this.
He must be nervous 'cause all the people are watching.
I'd really like it if he'd get used to his job.
Especially when he's talking to his superiors.
I mean, how many times does a girl have to remind him
before he gets it, you know?
It's irritating!
Anyway, on today's episode, we're going to introduce you
to a key character on "Lucky Star."
It's Konata!
Shut up, you pussy.
Why me? I didn't ask for this!
Miss Konata Izumi is 17.
She likes games, anime, and manga.
Yes, and according to our sources, she's always watching
the new shows and reading the latest manga.
On weekends, she spends her time gaming online till dawn.
So, you're saying she's an "otaku."
Well, yeah, I guess she is.
Huh...
Hurry, do something.
You know those crazy otaku, they never leave the house.
They're always crying while watching
the "Dog of Flanders" and stuff.
How dated is your idea of otaku anyway?
You do your homework or what?
Can you handle your job, guy, or what?
Well, umm...
Well, it's true that both the "Dog of Flanders"
and cute "moe" characters both have a healing effect, you know?
But girls like me are way better than some mangey dog.
These days, the public really wants to see
cute, innocent girls, right?
When I look to the right, they look to the right.
If I look left, they look left.
They wait in line all night before a concert
and they don't take a bath.
They stink so bad it makes your eyes water
and yet, they still want to see me.
That's what drives them. Standing like cattle
in the heat, burning under the damn sun waiting for me. Me!
Waiting until the bandanas around their heads get so sweaty
and it's all for me!
But in the end, I guess they are the customers, though.
Even if they insist on telling me their life story
at a handshake session.
And even if they do make a few off-topic comments,
you sympathize with them, you know?
'Cause in the end,
the only reason I'm here is 'cause of folks like that.
I gotta do my best up here, 'cause those people are my fans,
you know?
Is that what it's really like for you?
Oh, you'll find out real soon.
Being an idol is the hardest thing you'll ever do.
Oh, yeah, once you've been through the best and the worst,
you'll see what it's all about.
Some client or fan you hate comes up and you gotta smile.
Oh, that was fun!
Okay, did everybody get a good idea about who Konata-san is?
Yeah? Good! Then I'll see you again in the next episode.
Bye-nee!
Uh, actually today's show was
more about otakus than Konata-san.
Uh, are you okay?
You do it.
Huh? Oh sure!
At that moment, the reporter saw...
Now that's lame.
Yeah! That was awesome.
Kage rules!
Okay, calm down.
So, Tsukasa, did you pick a song?
Yep, I did.
I can't wait to hear you sing, Tsukasa-san.
I hope I can sing it good.
Hey, Miyuki, what are you gonna sing?
Oh, I don't know that many songs.
It's a little embarrassing.
Ooh! That's what she picked, huh?
Go for it, Tsukasa-san!
L-O-V-E, lovely, Tsukasa!
Oh, jeez.
L-O-V-E, lovely, Sayuri!
Who's Sayuri?
Whoo-hoo!
♪ Oh baby! ♪
The name isn't Sayuri Kuninama.
Does anyone know who Sayuri is?
What was her membership number again?
You're ruining the song.
- -
On the next episode of "Lucky Star..."
Kagami here.
You know how when you've got a hangnail
and it's just wiggling around?
You want to pull it out, but you think it's gonna hurt,
so you don't, but then you do and it comes out and it's bigger
than you thought and it hurts! Then there's scabs.
You try to time it so it doesn't hurt when you peel it off,
but then it starts getting itchy and you think,
"Sure that sucker's ready to rip, let's do this."
So you go slow, peeling from the sides first and then
you just rip through the center and you end up bleeding anyway.
And then you're like, "That's gonna leave a scar."
Next time: "Image."
Look forward to it!
Okay, let's do this.
Sure, let's go!
Quit screwing around and start!
It feels like forever since we last wore these uniforms.
Oh, look, it's Kona-chan.
Kona-chan, good morning.
Well well, Kagami-san, Tsukasa-san.
How do you do? Kiran!
Uhhh!
My, Tsukasa-san, it seems that your ribbon
has been tied crooked.
Thanks a lot.
Gross.
What's wrong, Kona-chan? You seem different.
Ah, yes, as of late I've found myself completely obsessed
with Marimite.
Marimite?
Grow up already!
Ha, ha, ha!
Ah ha ha ha!
So now what?
You're not gonna start dressing like a character
from that show?
Let's see. Isn't that cosplay?
Don't worry. I'm not gonna take it that far.
You sure about that?
Yeah, besides, I already do a ton of cosplay at work.
That's right. She works at a place like that, doesn't she?
Wonder what she'd be like as a classy lady.
Hmm.
That's so wrong I can't even picture it.
The baseball broadcasts are running longer and longer,
why do the fans of new anime have
to be the ones getting hosed all the time?
If watching anime is that important to you,
why don't you get cable or something,
don't they have channels for that kind of stuff?
Ha, you know if I could get it I totally would,
but the cable guys all say the same thing,
"We don't provide that service here."
Hi, Yuki-Chan, good morning.
Hello, Tsukasa-san, good morning.
Why are you so gloomy? Did something happen?
I had to have a cavity taken care of the other day.
Oh, so you went to the dentist? That's pretty brave.
Why is it that when you go to the dentist
to get some work done,
you find yourself returning there again and again?
You're so right! I totally know how you feel.
It's never just one or two trips, it's way more!
Miyuki-san, how do you do?
Oh Konata-san, how do you do?
I trust you're having a good day.
Yes, thank you for asking.
Wow, Miyuki-chan's amazing. It doesn't sound
weird when she talks proper like that.
She doesn't even notice that Konata's talking that way.
This is the first time I've ever seen anyone greet
someone else with a "how do you do."
Oh, is that so? At the all-girl high school that my other
friends attend, it's common for them to greet each other
with a "how do you do."
Wow. Schools for well-to-do girls are something else indeed.
So very elegant.
Hey, so teach told me to collect
your homework from summer vacation.
Very well then, Sebastian.
Seba-- who?
I would assume all butlers are named Sebastian, no?
I guess that's one way of looking at it.
Say something amusing, Sebastian.
No way.
Well, your vacation's over, people,
but now's not the time to be spacing out.
Y'all should be thinking about the future while your
divin' head first into your studies.
The future, huh? What am I gonna do?
I mean, now that I'm halfway finished with high school.
Oh, come on, Kagami, don't tell me you're seriously
thinking about your future?
Huh?! What's that supposed to mean?!
Well, for one thing, you did choose the liberal arts route
so you could be in the same class as us.
Tsukasa, you tattle-tale!
Sorry.
And of all the people you, you tell her?
Aw, you could tell us, be honest.
You're a lonesome little girl, aren't you?
There, there, it's okay.
Shut up you!
High school, high school.
Yoo-hoo! I'm here to hang out with you!
Onee-san, it's the homework I did over vacation,
I did what you said and wrote the answers that seemed right,
even though I didn't understand the questions,
and now I'm being forced to do it all over again.
You've gotta help me!
I guess I could, but then,
if I help you, they'll just make you do it all over again.
I think you know what I mean.
Curses.
You don't get an extension on summer vacation,
but you get one on the homework.
I better borrow Kagami's notes.
Listening to the cicadas always puts me to sleep, oh!
Huh? What the-- huh?
Aha! The baseball game went late, so the schedule's off.
Huh, guess something good can come of it after all.
Wait! My recorder's timer's off.
Huh?
Where are your glasses, Yuki-chan?
Well, you see, they broke this morning,
I had placed them on my chair and forgot about them,
it was an accident, I'm terribly sorry,
may I borrow today's notes from the two of you?
Of course!
You're still as clumsy as ever, keep it up!
Konata-san, you're handwriting is so mysterious.
Tsukasa-san, keep trying!
I swear it's like those two are totally useless, here.
Thank you so much.
It's a good thing we have the same teacher or you'd be stuck.
And could you please keep this a secret? It was such
a nice gesture and I'd hate to pour cold water on it.
I'm starving!
Are you ready to have lunch with us, Yuki-chan?
Tsukasa-san, Konata-san, here are your notes.
Thank you so much for them.
Not at all, no need to thank us, we're happy to help.
I never thought I'd be lending you my notes, Yuki-chan.
I was so surprised.
Doubt it'll happen again though.
Ah! Mmm! Stare.
Uh, what is it, do I have something on my face?
In games when characters with glasses come to school
without glasses, they suddenly become popular.
But I guess that doesn't happen in real life.
Ah! No I guess not, unfortunately.
Anyone else think choco cornets look like drills?
Huh, drills?
That's right! I just remembered we were talking about
which end of a choco cornet's the head,
and how the thin end kinda looks like a butt.
Hmm, although if you look again,
the thicker end looks more like the butt.
A butt?
Well, that's a big butt, and a layered belly.
When you gain weight on the lower half of your body,
trying to find a skirt that fits you is really difficult.
Yeah, right! When it fits your waist it doesn't fit
your hips, when the skirt fits your hips just right,
the waist is all loose.
But you can't help it, so you buy the one with
the loose waist, and then when you're out walking,
the skirt starts spinning around until it's backwards.
I know!
A layered belly on a cornet body.
Flip it to the side and it's a sleeping body.
If you sleep too much, you'll get a cornet body.
Let me know when I'm supposed to laugh, okay?
Hey, sis, didn't you go on some kind of diet
to get rid of your summer pudginess?
Yeah, I did, but even though I lost some weight,
I didn't lose anything on my waist or hips.
No, Kagami, it did work.
I can totally see the fruits of your diet.
Really?
Yep, the difference is crystal clear.
They say that when you go on a diet,
the places where you don't wanna lose weight
are always the first ones to go bye-bye.
Cut it out! Don't even go there!
So when you read literature the idea is to always
be thinking about the message that
the author is trying to convey.
I see, I see, I see.
I heard that if your eyesight's bad,
you look like you're glaring and it freaks people out.
But then again, it depends on the person.
Hold it right there! You looked at me when you said
it depends on the person, didn't you?
I heard that when you make your eyes all narrow,
it makes you look pretty.
You get this wistful faraway look, or something like that.
Wait, what are we doing?
Konata's late, she should be here by now.
Where the heck is she?
Oh, there!
I'm here, I'm here! Sorry I'm late.
Oh you think? You know, for someone
who's always complaining about ball games running late,
I'd think you'd be more punctual.
Yeah, well, you know, lately all the games have been
going over so I guess maybe I caught the bug too.
What, like the flu?
Well, what's the story, why are you late? Slept in?
No, no, it's not that. I'm not a child.
Then I can't wait to hear the grownup reason you're late.
Well, okay, when I got ready to leave the house to come here,
I noticed that it was still early,
and I had some time to kill. I figured "yeah." So I started
playing this game, and then I just couldn't stop.
Even for a child that's a crappy excuse.
Now that we're in our second trimester,
we've got the arts festival and sports festival coming up,
and exams right after.
You'll do great at the sports festival, Kona-chan,
'cause you're so athletic.
Sports festivals make me tired.
Yeah, well, it's rare to find a homebody like you
who's in such good physical shape.
I wonder what our class is gonna do for the arts festival?
I don't think there's anything anyone wants to do.
We can't really decide on anything to do
unless somebody steps up and says they wanna do something.
But the person who does always gets stuck putting
everything together so nobody says anything.
And then the only time we have to do anything is after school.
And then we get home late and miss all the anime.
Where have I heard that before?
Lucky Star!
Since dad's put me in charge of cooking the dinner tonight,
I gotta go grocery shopping.
Yeah? So what are you gonna make?
Everyone's favorite, chicken curry.
Everybody in my family just loves chicken.
Chicken curry, huh? That sounds good.
You know, I heard once that if you let curry sit out overnight,
it gets yummier.
I heard that too. I know what I'll do, I'll make a little
extra and then I can have it for lunch tomorrow.
We always have leftovers.
Hiiragi residence.
Uh, Tsukasa.
Kona-chan?
It's so early. Anything wrong?
Yeah, it's the curry.
Curry?
The curry I made yesterday,
I left it out overnight, and it spoiled.
What? No way.
Way.
But why? Curry doesn't usually go bad overnight.
I know.
Did you put something weird in it?
No, but this morning there
was mold all over it.
So cornets for lunch again?
I don't mind. This thing's tasty.
Well, as long as you're okay with it.
Wait, hang on a second.
You know, I just realized something
about the kind of lunches you guys bring to school.
Some days you bring proper lunches,
and other days you bring simple lunches.
Why's there such a huge difference?
Oh, well, that's because Tsukasa and I always take
turns making the lunches.
Hmm.
Stuff like lunches always end up being kinda simple
'cause I'm not that good at doing housework.
There, I'm simple. Happy now?
Yes! Kagami, you're the type of person who makes pots
and pans explode whenever you cook.
Relax, nobody can do that.
Wow, Yuki-chan, your lunch looks super tasty today.
Really? Oh, I just packed
some of last night's leftovers.
Oh!
Dinner at Mikyuki-san's house.
Is really fancy.
And these are just the leftovers.
Hey, um, everything looks so good,
what's the filling inside the fried eggs?
Oh, well, we had eel last night,
so I just put that into the eggs.
You never see leftover eel.
Moldy curry's the only leftover at my house.
Well, your house isn't really normal, is it?
--Good Morning. --Hi.
Hey, you.
Look, look, my parents bought me a cell phone.
That's pretty cool of them.
Yeah, I did really good on my exams this time,
so they got it for me.
Well, now that you finally got one,
give me your number and I'll give you mine.
Sure, I just gotta go find my number.
Let's see.
Hmm.
Uh, sorry, this'll take a second.
Oh, oh!
I didn't know you had a cell phone, Konata.
Except I keep it at home 'cause I always forget to bring it.
Besides, my dad's the only one who ever calls me.
Then it's pointless for you to even have a cell phone.
Oh, yeah?
--Kerororo. --Whoa!
Isn't he cute? Mom and Dad bought him for me
with the cell phone.
That reminds me, there's this girl in my class
who's got a ton of straps hanging from her phone.
She decided to weigh it to see how heavy it was,
and the straps alone were like 800 grams.
Oh, wow, that's a lot.
That's heavy.
Once she took the straps off,
her shoulders didn't hurt anymore.
Think about it, every time she made a call
or answered the phone she was working out.
It's weird, but cell phones always make me nervous,
you never really know know when they're gonna ring.
Really.
Oh, I hope somebody calls me on my new cell phone.
You're losing it over a cell phone.
These days they're not that big a deal.
By the way, did you ever find your number?
Oh! Oh, not yet.
And in England, the House of Lancaster and
the House of York began a series of civil wars for the throne.
On the battlefield, the armies of Lancaster wore red roses,
and the armies of York wore white.
That's why it's called the War of the Roses.
The fighting started in 1455 and went all the way
to 1485 and that's when--
Uh, what is that? Is that my cell phone?
Oh, I finally got a call.
Huh? Who's this?
Okay, confiscated.
You can pick it up at my office after school.
Yay! She gave it back to me.
It sucks that your first call was a spam text.
Hi, oh, hey, Dad, yeah I'm still at school.
Just hanging out with Konata and Miyuki
and lost track of time. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be heading home in a little bit. See ya.
That always happens even if I'm a little late.
-- --
Hello? Oh, hiya, Dad, yeah, I'm still at school
with Kona-chan and the others, yeah.
You think he'd figure it out after calling one of us.
Fathers always worry about their daughters,
it's what they do best.
Can you believe how much spam you get these days?
You just need to change your address
to something that's not too obvious.
I changed mine, and it's all good.
Not too obvious, huh? Gimme an example.
Well, I got my address written out to say
"meganekko geki love" in romaji.
What I really wanted was something with maid in it,
but addresses with maid-san and miko-san are so popular
they've all been snapped up.
Wait, you don't have to broadcast it
to everyone on the bus. I got it, I got it already.
The stuff you're talking about is worse than the spam problem.
Good morning!
Hey, you.
Oh, why are you crying? What's wrong?
My poor little cell phone, it never hurt anyone.
She sort of forgot to take it out of her pocket.
Aw, then it's gone on to a much better place.
They'll never buy me another cell phone again.
Oh, he made it through unscathed.
Persistent little guy.
Oh, hey, about that text you sent me last night.
You know the one that said something about how Kagami
wanted me to return her homework notes today?
Was that the last message you sent?
Yeah, that was the last, did you reply to it?
Huh? Let's see.
How come it's so hard for you
to return a simple text message?!
I never reply to a text when it's from someone
I'll be talking to later on.
You're supposed to reply to those things.
I see you every day. What's the point in going to that trouble?
You're gonna lose friends that way.
Ah, it's not like it's so important it can't wait.
How can you say that?
Huh, after all the back and forth,
I still didn't get my notes back.
Tsukasa, can I come in?
--Oh, hey, sis. --Ha!
-- --What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
This manga I borrowed from Kona-chan made me weepy.
Good morning! Thanks for letting me borrow the manga.
It was really cool.
Yeah, wasn't that silly, bet it made ya laugh.
Huh? But it was so touching that it made me cry.
It's hard to believe you guys
are talking about the same manga.
Here if you cry, you're on Tsukasa's side,
but if you laugh, you're on my side.
No way.
I don't wanna be classified with either one of you.
I think it'd be kinda neat to see how you react to it.
Oh, is it really such a bad thing to
wanna know what your friends are all about?.
Here's an idea, attack number...
-- --did you cry or did you laugh?
--I laughed. --I cried.
Okay, what's your favorite manga?
"Keroro Gunso."
I can't really tell if these
guys are the same or not anymore.
Why don't you join the manga club or something, Kona-chan?
I mean, you like manga.
Yeah, I guess I wouldn't mind joining up with those guys,
I'm pretty sure they've at least got flexible hours.
Draw draw draw draw.
What the, you call this drawing?
Mm-hmm.
I got a question, this thing here, who's it a picture of?
That's Tsukasa.
Really? That's me?
And that's Miyuki-san.
I guess you sorta got the feel for her.
This is Kagami.
Oh, I breathe fire, huh?
My, it's the spitting image of you isn't it?
What a scary little girl, how frightening.
Would you cut it out already?!
Oh, the new "Fullmetal" book just came out.
Yeah, the new issue of "Compti" came out today too.
I'm gonna swing by Gamers now, do you guys wanna go?
Oh, sorry, I think I'll just go by the local bookstore today
I got errands to run.
But you have to come with me to Gamers today 'cause
it'll nurture the friendship between us.
Stop it. What's up with you today? You use a word like
friendship and it doesn't fit you at all.
Oh, yeah, that, I was just trying to get you to
give me all your purchase points
by appealing to your sense of loyalty.
So that's all my friendship means to you?
What a crock.
Lucky Star!
Man, it's quiet, is she mad I used
the sunflowers for the pigtail gag? I wonder.
Huh, what, who me? Huh?
You want me?
Akira-sama? Me? Oh, okay, got it.
Hey, um. I think we're on the air right now so uh...
if I don't do somethin' now they're gonna change--
Hiya, Luckies! Or you know, however she says that line.
Okay, guys, Lucky Channel's on the air again this week
and I'm Minoru Shiraishi, the assistant.
Akira-sama's in a bad mood.
Ha!
How dare you introduce yourself before introducing me,
Akira Kogami. Do you not understand what rank is?
No, I was--
-- --Huh!
I've noticed you've been getting quite
popular around here lately,
you and those pigtails.
Me? Popular? No not at all.
You're so full of yourself, it makes me sick!
I'm terribly sorry!
First off, everybody was expecting
the Akira fashion project
to showcase me, yes, me and my pigtails.
What are those?
You're right, you're absolutely right!
Hmm, I'm gonna wear twin drills.
You're kidding, twin drills?
Don't underestimate the speed of the getter.
Number two, huh? Pigtails are over.
The next big thing is going to be twin drills.
Didn't Konata say in episode two
that a drill is kinda like a guy's, you know?
Did she now?
All righty, everyone, we're gonna straighten this out
on our radio show and on our website!
So, until the next episode.
Bye, me!
--So... --Yes.
The pigtails.
Oh, the ones I had.
The ones in the picture.
Yes.
--Were those sunflowers? --They were.
I think I've seen those somewhere before.
What do you mean?
--Years ago... --Whoa! Hang on a sec!
--One of my first-- --Gero gero! Gero gero!
Boy, was I nervous.
It was very cute and very well done.
Don't you get nervous on the first song you sing?
You think "am I gonna sing this song good enough," you know?
Your turn, Miyuki!
I'd like her to sing "Omoide Ga Ippai."
Why that one?
Would you please hand me the mic?
Here. Good luck!
Umm, I don't do this very often,
so I'd like to apologize ahead of time
if my singing hurts your ears.
Don't worry, you'll do great!
Wow, good one!
I totally get the connection here. Nice, Miyuki.
Oh, her voice is awesome!
This is a new kind of moe and it's workin'.
Yuki-chan, you're so cool!
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"...
Tsukasa here! Wait, time's up?
Next time "Energetic Despite Not Being Myself."
Look forward to it!
Okay, let's do this.
Sure, let's go!
Quit screwing around and start!
Today's the warmest it's been all autumn, and all over
the country school athletic festivals are what's happening.
Yeah, I just came to cheer my daughter on,
but who knew it'd be this exciting?
I mean, the trip was well worth it!
Let me tell you, some of these pictures are amazing!
Oh, Dad.
I wonder whose daughter you're talking about.
I don't know. Maybe I should cut my hair for the festival.
Just chop it all off really short.
Ah! Why do you want to cut your hair?
It's taken you forever to grow it out!
Uh, I wasn't serious, I was just thinking.
Such a profound response must mean...
It's about a guy, isn't it?
Don't relate everything to that!
And don't talk so much, Tsukasa!
But if Kagami did go and cut her hair...
Isn't the super slim Pocky the same
as regular Pocky?
Don't do it!
Pigtails are the classic tsundere hairstyle!
Sorry, my face is so boring!
Oh, yeah, the athletic festivals' coming up.
What a drag.
I never thought I'd hear a teenager say that.
You're good at sports, Kona-chan, so you'll do great,
but someone like me?
I'll just get in the way.
--Aww! --You're gonna be fine.
Hey, sis, which event are you gonna sign up for?
I totally know what Kagami's gonna pick.
The bread-eating race!
If I didn't know better, I'd say you're trying
to pick a fight with me.
All righty then, what event are you going to sign up for?
Uhh.
Was I right? I was, wasn't I?
Pissing me off!
I guess you could say I've been doing
some training for the festival.
Autumn is the season for sports, you know.
Really?
The question is, are you really doing it for the festival,
or are you doing it for the event thing
that happens after it?
What event thing?
You want me to say it?
Really pissing me off!
So, Miyuki's gonna be running in the relay race, huh?
That's understandable.
You're tellin' me. But get this,
at first, she was gonna do the obstacle course!
Okay, does anybody else feel like volunteering?
Though I've never done that before,I'll do my best!
But you can't, Miyuki-san!
Huh?
With those curvy curves, you shouldn't be doing
the obstacle course.
You'll have to squeeze through things and go over stuff.
After that, she got switched to the relay.
That sounds like something a middle aged guy would say.
Do you remember back in junior high?
Did your school ever have any scavenger hunts?
Yeah, we did those.
One time a guy who was doing it
came up to me with his list.
Me?
The weird thing is, he was too embarrassed to tell me
what he wanted to scavenge.
I wonder what it was.
There are so many unspeakable things it could be.
Well, I could ask Miyuki-san.
She might have an idea.
Leave her out of it, there's no easy answer
for a question like that.
She asked her anyway!
Something about you that's hard to mention
that might be the item in a scavenger hunt?
Mm-hmm.
It's only speculation, but perhaps
it's the mole on your face.
One could consider that a sensitive subject.
Figures, she's a master at dodging difficult questions.
But I'm sure she's wrong
I do enjoy the athletic festivals,
but after that we still have exams.
I think it's kinda sad 'cause after the festivals' over
we run out of things to do.
The midterm proficiency and finals exams
are all we have left!
And you always wear yourself out in the second trimester
'cause of the arts and athletic festivals.
Yeah.
The midterm is going to be especially difficult!
I heard that Autumn's a good time for reading,
so maybe I'll read some books.
The climate this time of year is also
excellent for studying.
And right before Christmas is when they
bust out all the new games!
Although we have final exams before that.
Oh, yeah, and then there's--
Hold it! How about the two of you
stop avoiding the inevitable?
That's right! It's almost time for the athletic festival.
Do you know that pistol that starts the events?
I always thought that was a real gun!
I never figured it out
--till junior high. --You've gotta be kidding.
No, I think seeing that is what made me
want to become a cop in the first place.
You chose your career because of a misunderstanding?
Oh, by the way, Konata,
when's the school athletics festival happening?
Here, it's this Sunday.
Augh! This Sunday?
How come you didn't say anything?
Why didn't you tell me this before?
But, Dad, we just got the flyer today.
I'd better get ready.
What's up with your dad?
All right, people, today's the real deal.
You're gonna get out there and show 'em all
the fruits of your labor!
Yeah, ma'am? I haven't labored that much but don't worry,
this stuff's gonna be a piece of cake.
Don't get cocky!
The cavalier race is where I want you to give 'em all hell!
Attack the enemy from all sides
and pound 'em till they holler!
Wouldn't it be better if we found their weak spot
and pounded that until they holler?
But all we need to do is take their hats,
I don't know about pounding.
Relax, don't sweat the small stuff.
That's one of the mistakes you make when you're a kid.
'Cause you're just a kid.
We're rooting for you, sis!
Do your best out there!
Hey, do either of you know how they get the red bean buns
to stay on the strings?
Most likely the buns are attached by
some sort of clip or something.
Oh. I guess it'll make it harder to pull them off then.
Just remember you're a girl!
And as a girl you must win elegantly!
There's nothing elegant about a bread eating race!
-Get set! -
Aah!
She did it!
Yup, that's our Kagami.
That man's camera is really amazing.
My dad. He's so easy to get.
Hey, aren't you running the 100 meter dash?
It's coming up.
Yeah. I guess.
Kona-chan, can you teach me how to run fast like you?
Just imagine yourself winning.
It's all about visualization.
On your mark!
Get set!
That's some old school visualization
you got going on.
Goal!
Kinda like that.
You're kidding.
Three meters, 25 centimeters.
If you fall back they only measure up
to where your hands hit.
- -Oh, yeah!
That's Kagami.
The sand's not even safe from her jabs.
One two three, one two three.
I heard that to run the hurdles you have to
time the number of your steps.
I don't get it.
One, two, and three and jump!
Oh, now I get it!
One, two, three, one, two, three.
Get set!
Three, two, three, one, three, huh?
Wait, I started off with my right foot so that's
two, three, one!
I'm not getting it!
I'm on my left foot now, so--
Wait! What is it?
Three, two, one, augh!
Stunning. She's plowing through every single
one of those things.
She's got a knack for it.
I guess I suck, huh?
No, listen, I thought my daughter was in that race.
I didn't know, honest!
Same old, same old.
Time for the last relay race.
Yuki-chan, do your best out there!
You've got it all wrong, my daughter goes to this school!
Hang on, I haven't done anything!
Yeah, way to go, you can do it, run!
All right, we're in second place!
We're doing pretty good then.
Over here, Sachi!
Here! Got it!
We're in third place now.
Now this is what I call a race!
They're putting up a good fight!
It's getting interesting.
I wonder if Yuki-chan's going to be all right.
Got it.
Whoa!
Go, Miyuki!
All right, Yuki-chan, you're so awesome!
That's our Miyuki-san.
She even remembers to give the audience fan service.
Lucky Star.
Hmm. Okay.
Is that Tsukasa?
Oh, man.
Happy Henry likes beer, but could not obtain food.
Hey, uh, could you do something about that noise?
Sorry about that! I'm playing the alto recorder
in music class, but every time I play a note,
it feels like I'm gonna pull a muscle!
Why did you choose the alto part?
Well I sort of thought the lower parts
would be easier to play.
Oh. Well, how about you get your fingers used to
the recorder by playing a simpler song?
Oh!
You're missing most of the notes.
Just try to follow what I do, okay?
Ready, and...
Whoa, hang on, Tsukasa, try it by yourself.
That doesn't seem right somehow.
When you're playing, try relaxing a bit more.
Maybe you'll play better if you're not as tense, you know?
Okay, just relax.
Yep.
I'll give it a shot. Here we go.
She's sucking in more air than she's blowing out.
I'd eat in the cafeteria more, but every time
I come here, it's always super packed.
If I don't get some food, I'm gonna faint!
Standing in line always makes me tired.
Man, this blows.
Aren't you used to this kinda stuff
from all the cons you go to?
Yeah, but if there's nothing exciting at the other end,
waiting in line sucks!
Well, at least you stay true to the things you like.
That reminds me, the other day
I went to an amusement park.
I thought I was in line for one of the attractions,
but I was actually in line for the restroom.
You're always supposed to check what you're
lining up for before you line up!
I was standing in line for hours.
Oh, you know, when I get stuck standing in a line,
the person in front of me ends up buying the last
of the thing I wanted to buy.
Actually, that happens to me a lot!
You're just unlucky, Tsukasa.
Do you all know what you're getting for lunch today?
How tragic. Oh well, I guess curry's good enough.
I think I'm gonna go with ramen.
Ooh, me too!
I was craving some miso ramen today with lots
of corn and seaweed.
That's what I'm gonna get.
You also gonna get the eclair and the flan pudding?
Only if I have room for dessert.
You always have room for dessert.
What are you getting?
I think I'd like to have a sandwich today
with some strawberries.
That totally sounds like something you'd have.
-Yeah. -Hang on.
Just throwin' this out there, but isn't
a strawberry sandwich dessert, or can you even call
something like that lunch?
You do have a point there.
You get picky about the weirdest things.
Oh, what about the choco cornets you're always eating?
Wouldn't they be considered a dessert?
How dare you question my choco cornets?
Well, now that that's settled,
I've got some bad news for Miyuki-san.
The line for the sandwiches is over there.
That's typical of her.
That girl is moe incarnate.
Oh, look, Kona-chan, you're up next.
I'd like some curry please, with extra sauce.
You got it!
I admire your cunning!
Hey, I'll take whatever I can get.
Okay, next?
The soy ramen please, with sort of firm noodles.
Okay, it'll just take me a minute.
Sorry about the wait. Here you go.
I'll go ahead and grab us some seats, okay, guys?
-Okay, thanks! -Okay, thanks a lot!
Okay, folks, who's next?
I'm next, may I please have the miso ramen?
Oh, I'm sorry, the person ahead of you
just got the last of the noodles.
We're all out of ramen for today.
If you don't mind having soy flavored ramen,
you can have mine.
I can always get the kitsune udon.
Thanks sis, you're the best.
I just thought of something.
Hmm?
You get to be the older sister because
you were the one to pop out first, right?
That's right.
I'm so glad I get to be the younger sister!
Okay, why's that?
'Cause its kinda sad if the older sister is
asking the younger one for help with homework
or if she's asking to copy it.
When it comes to copying homework, I don't think
any of that matters anyway.
Look, we're twins, so I don't think there's
any difference as far as age goes.
Don't worry about it.
Just hurry up and finish your homework.
Okay!
I wonder how it would be if I were the older sister
and I was all reliable and stuff like her.
Oh, please, sis, could you show me your homework?
Again? Come on, Kagami, do I even have a choice?
-You gonna be okay over there? -You're so amazing!
You're spazzin' out.
Ta-da!
New Type has published my very own postcard!
It's gonna be in the May issue!
"Konata Izumi from Saitama."
Wow, that is pretty cool. Can't believe they printed it.
Huh?
I mean awesome, girl, amazing!
It's a once in a lifetime thing!
I know, isn't it?
Now I got another reason to pick up a copy!
A bunch of copies!
Don't worry, I'll still be your friend.
This one's 1,260 yen,
and this one's 567.
If I get another book, I'll get another point.
I'll just pick one of these, and then I'm good.
No, it's a trap. That's what they want you to do.
But I'm way too smart to let 'em do me like that.
Making me buy something I don't want just so
I get an extra point?
I'm so on to their little game.
Ha ha ha. What do they think I am, stupid?
There's no way I'm gonna fall for that old trick.
Whoa!
I totally forgot volume five was out!
Yes, please, this'll do.
That'll be 2,587 yen, please!
Eh, whatever.
-They're stuck, -Oh, I'm so sorry!
Looks like they wanna stay together, huh?
I always stuff like that only ever
happened in manga and games.
Looks like they happen in real life too.
Yeah, you think?
You know what?
Those two totally triggered flags back there!
Konata, fantasy isn't reality, it's illusion.
Try not to mix them up, okay?
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, luckies!
Delivering tons of love with a dream-colored heart!
I'm your navigator Akira Kogami. Welcome to Lucky Channel!
Hi there, I'm Minoru Shiraishi, the assistant!
Wow, it's already the eighth episode!
Isn't it crazy how time just flies by?
I heard that!
We should start thinking about getting some new material
or folks'll start saying we're stuck in a rut!
What was that?
What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do?
No, I was thinking about trying some new stuff is all.
-You said it. -You know, yeah.
Oh, by the way, when I was walking around the other day,
someone called me over!
Was it a survey for a day spa?
Oh, come on now, Shiraishi-san,
do you know what you're saying?
Of course you don't know, see, it was a fan.
But you don't know about fans because you don't have any!
Right?
Ah! No, I don't have any fans!
No, of course you don't!
You're just an assistant, right?
Keep up the hard work, assistant!
But I do have a couple of fans, look! You see?
Augh! What the--
What the hell, Edo,
where's my fan letters?
Why you...
Just one freakin' letter?
"Your membership is about to expire, please respond by"--
This is junk mail from the video store!
This is a shout out to all of you guys
sitting in front of the TV!
Please send me some fan mail or I'm gonna cry!
I want want want your letters, okay?
Shouldn't we be starting the show now, Akira-sama?
Don't be so damn conceited.
It'd be easy to replace you, feel me?
Sorry, ma'am.
Tada! We have an announcement!
We're gonna be taking characters from the show
and making super cool figures out of them!
Akira-sama, the board! It's upside down!
Oh, ha! You're doing it on purpose. You're so funny!
Let me tell you guys how it's gonna work this time around!
Peel, peel, peel.
Don't touch me.
Heh, this is totally weird.
So, here's how it's gonna work this time around!
Don't touch me.
This damn time around!
Peel, p-peel, peel! Ugh.
Hey! What the hell, you guys?
Hey, what the-- You're blocking my close-up, Joe!
Get the hell out of my shot!
Get your ass out of the way!
This is all your fault, isn't it?
No, it's not!
Oh, hi! So about this figure project thingy,
we're gonna need you guys to vote on it to see
which character's gonna be turned into a figure, okay?
We're waiting for your opinions so don't disappoint us,
you got it?
Make sure you guys vote for your favorite!
Whoa! It looks like we're all out of show for today!
I hope we see each other again next time!
Bye-bye, me.
It's obvious someone from the main segment
is gonna get this one too.
What am I, some kind of freak, a friggin' clown?
Nothing has been decided yet.
Actually, they are making a figure out of me.
The hell you talkin' about? Who said you wer--
Miyuki-chan, that was amazing!
I'm sorry it wasn't better.
That's a side of you I never thought I'd see!
Oh, please, you're embarrassing me.
Oh! Yuki-chan, let's sing something together.
I'd love to!
Yeah, go for it guys!
Sing a duet!
What do you wanna sing?
Let me see...
While you decide, I'm gonna rock the mic!
You're gonna sing again?
Yeah, Kagami, and you should sing more too!
- -What's this?
Saiyuki! Masaaki's Son Goku was the best!
Didn't Shingo-chan play that character?
Yeah, like the third time they did it.
This is the theme song from the original 52-episode series
that ran from 1978 to 1980.
Yes, did you feel that?
How old are you?
This is a long intro.
This is the part where Octogawa-sensei
goes into his awesome narration!
I don't know who that is!
Oh, here it comes!
Ataaaaaa!
More shouting?
What the-- that's not even English, I'm out.
You got us all worked up for nothing.
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"...
Miyuki here.
When one is attempting to illustrate the size
of something that is incredibly large,
they'll use the term super D class to describe it.
The "D" stands for the "HMS Dreadnought,"
a battleship of the English Navy that was activated
into service in 1906.
Now then, the term super D class,
or super Dreadnought class, originally referred to anything
that was larger than the HMS Dreadnought.
Well, that was the original meaning behind the term.
These days, however, the term is used mostly in the context
that I described to you earlier.
Next time, "That Feeling."
Look forward to it!
Okay, let's do this.
Sure, let's go!
Quit screwing around and start!
Now that autumn's here, it's the perfect time for reading.
So, I've been reading lots of books.
Whoa, that's unusual.
I know it's good for me, 'cause I'm gettin'
all this knowledge, but it's starting to get expensive.
You don't have to buy them,
just go to the library and check 'em out.
I'll bet they've got a lot of stuff you'd like.
No, a library wouldn't really carry
that big a selection of manga.
Reading books, huh?
Reading books.
I just can't concentrate.
Well, everyone needs to take a breather now and then.
A little gaming should help me relax.
Oh, Miss Kuroi's online.
"How's it going? Stop messing around and start studying
'cause you know I'll yell at you if your scores suck."
Curses! They got me surrounded.
Please, Teach, have mercy!
Playin' my game's no fun when reality comes a knockin'.
Sigh.
Quick question, ma'am,
when you were in school and had to study for a test,
what'd you do when you got bored?
"When I couldn't concentrate,
I went and goofed off or I slept. Nothing special."
That's what I do.
"But I'm your teacher, so I've got to be hard on you."
I get where she's coming from,
but it still blows!
If I want to good at school,
I have to set some goals and work my way up.
So, could you teach me all the stuff I don't understand?
Sure, we can study together.
So for this one,
the value of "X" is gonna be equal to--
What?
Nothing, I looked at the clock
and realized my show just started.
Tonight's episode is when this magazine
writes an article about the main character
and then everybody finds out that she's pregnant.
I see. Are you gonna watch it, then?
Mmm. It's okay I'm recording it.
Boink.
I know!
I get sleepy when there's a lot
of stuff I don't understand.
Guess you've been sleepy the whole time then.
Maybe I shouldn't overdo it
right off the bat like this.
I think I'm gonna call it a day.
Okay, but it looks like your ambition
needs to do some catching up with your goals.
I still can't concentrate. All right!
Oh, you say you'd like some tips for studying?
Yep, I was sort of wondering if you had any advice for me.
Let me see. You tend to burn yourself out
if you concentrate too hard on something.
I find that when studying,
if I stick to my usual habits, I'll be fine.
I'm feeling confident about that test today.
It's like I've been enlightened or something.
But your usual habits consist of you not doing anything,
so what's the big deal?
Oh, you mean even if it's really, really cute?
Yep, and you gotta watch out for their claws
'cause they're poisonous.
My, I didn't realize they could be so utterly frightening.
--Howdy, guys. --Huh?
Hey, Kagami, how'd you do on the test?
Yeah, I didn't do so hot this time,
but my grade was still in the top percent.
Even you have rough patches, don't you?
You know, this time she helped me study for my test.
And I got a really good score too, better than usual.
So, how did you do on it?
Even though I was pretty confident, I didn't do so good.
It's kind of a mystery.
No mystery there.
Inevitable's a more accurate description.
Anyway, I was thinking about how we're sort of
like birds of a feather flocking together.
-Hmm? -Think about it.
For one thing, both you and Miyuki-san
are class representatives, aren't you?
-Yeah. -And then, you and me
both like to play video games, right?
Yeah, but we don't play the same genres.
You like dating sims and RPGs,
and I like to play shooting games.
I used to think Tsukasa and me were the same,
but after this test I can see the difference.
-She's not as dumb. -
Well, I'm not going to worry
too much about blowing the test this time.
You should definitely worry.
Just 'cause no one did well,
doesn't mean it's okay to slack.
You'll get left behind.
Hmm.
Hmm?
Actually, this time around
me and dad didn't bet on anything anyway.
So, I've got nothing to be upset about.
I seriously doubt you're
ever gonna amount to anything.
If you're gonna to look to Miyuki for studying tips,
try taking more notes and not just when exams hit.
I think Miyuki-san is very sensible.
She's definitely a Type "A" person.
You know I hear that from a lot of people,
but in reality my blood type is "O."
Really, "O"? You don't look it.
Well, actually...
...according to this book
on blood types and personality traits,
I have many of the characteristics
of a person with type "O" blood.
I'll find an example.
Here, it states that type "O" people are childish and naive.
That description fits me perfectly, don't you think?
"Type 'O' people also tend to be pushy, stingy, and greedy."
Ah, I didn't know you had a dark side, Miyuki-san.
Aren't you a Type "A" person?
Yeah, although a lot of people mistake me
--for a Type "B" person. --Huh?
"The Type 'A' person is sensible and considerate to others,
and they also create peaceful relationships."
Are you sure about this?
I'm a caring and sensitive person, don't you know?
Only about the things you're interested in.
I'm gentle and kind and love everyone.
Only when you need to copy homework.
Hmm.
Okay then, what's your blood type?
Who me? I'm a Type "B."
"Blood Type 'B,' someone who's rude, contrary,
moody, thoughtless, disjointed, and slacking."
Got a problem with it?
--Then, Tsukasa's a Type "AB." --Huh?
--Why do you say that? --Yeah, why?
Just thinkin' out loud.
See, if you go by your personalities,
Tsukasa looks like a Type "A"
and Kagami looks like a Type "B."
Nice theory, although we're both Type "B,"
and we're sort of twins, so there's that.
Yeah, that's right. My bad.
And while we're on it, you're a bigger slacker than I am.
There are several ways of predicting personality types,
such as using animals or even sushi.
Sushi?
Here is what Miyuki-san is.
Ooh, Miyuki's ikura, huh?
Even her sushi's classy.
Goody, I just love ikura!
So, how about me and Tsukasa?
Mmm.
Cucumber roll.
A cucumber roll?
Well, I guess it is considered to be sushi.
This thing is petty accurate.
What does that thing say about you?
I wonder.
Ginger...
You're ginger!
Don't be dissin' the ginger!
She's right, ginger is an essential component
to any sushi meal.
Besides, her outlook seems to be a favorable one.
Yeah, Miyuki's right.
Cucumber rolls are more like sushi than ginger.
Oh.
Hey, Konata, so about that blood type stuff
we were talking about today.
Well, fraternal twins can have different blood types.
I didn't want you to think that you were wrong
when you weren't, but I just wanted to let you know
you were right about it, so...
Well, thanks for being so honest.
That's pretty cool of you.
I guess there's Type A in you after all.
Oh, check it out.
The other day, I saw 'em do one
of those psychic readings on TV.
Yeah, you know with that kinda stuff,
the guesses hit the mark sometimes,
but sometimes they're way off too.
It's all a part the show.
Statistically speaking if you make enough guesses,
you're bound to get a few of 'em right.
Kagami, do you realize that if you keep saying stuff
like that, your life is going to be the most boring ever?
Can't you act more like a teenager?
Wow, you did pretty good this time, Tsukasa.
Ooh, Kagami, this time you didn't
--do as good as you usually do. --
Even so, Kagami still got a better score.
Hmm.
Well, girls, I know you both worked hard.
The two of you studied and did your best
and I have to say I'm really proud.
Wow! You did pretty good, Tsukasa.
But Kagami did better.
No surprise there.
Come on, Matsuri,
can't you be a little more considerate?
Good morning, ma'am, how are you?
Good morning, girls, how are you?
The two of you are such fine young ladies.
I really do envy you, you know that?
Not at all.
You're both Ryouou High, right?
I hear your grades are so stellar.
If only I could get my child to be half as smart as you.
It feels like I'm getting compliments
because I'm her sister.
Does that even count?
I don't know.
- -"Lucky Star."
Since we're done with exams,
how about we go out and have some fun?
Yeah, good call.
You guys want to go see a movie or something?
Is there anything good playing right now?
There is, and I hear it's awesome.
Oh, really?
Yeah, we're talking premium entertainment.
It's a hybrid splatter film slash psycho-suspense thriller.
Whoa, sounds good. Let's go for it.
We should go home and change
then meet up later.
Sounds like a plan.
Let's get it on.
I'm not having fun.
I'm really not having fun.
We still have a couple of minutes.
As usual, she's late again.
We're gonna miss the movie.
Oh, darn it.
For once, I'd like to see Konata show up
before we do, you know?
Jeez Louise, the thing's gonna start in a minute.
When'd you get here?
I didn't know it was you until I saw that.
Glad you could make it.
Now, let's get inside before it starts.
Ooh, wait a sec. I need a favor.
Can you guys let me pose as your sister?
Why, what's the deal?
Well, I'm gonna get a children's ticket,
but I don't want to get hassled going in.
Lousy brat! She's always going off
about her height, but she totally exploits it
whenever she can.
That was scary, Tuckabee.
Oh, man, you're so cute.
I could use some food right now.
I heard that. Aren't you hungry
after all that screaming, Tsukasa?
Mm-hmm.
What do you want to eat?
Hey, how about we hit up a cake buffet?
That sounds good.
A buffet...
...the sanctuary for all that a woman desires.
They sure have a lot of different cakes and drinks here.
Yeah, you're right.
I wonder if we can try one of everything.
Piece of cake for you, Kagamin.
First things first, there's a one-hour
time limit for each table.
You can find our selection of drinks
over in the drink corner,
and you'll find our various cakes
in the showcases over there.
So feel free to take what you want.
-Okay. -Bow.
Oh, by the way, if you can't finish
and have an excessive amount of leftovers,
you'll have to pay a separate fee
for what you leave behind.
I just wanted to give you ladies a heads up.
Okay.
Very good. Please enjoy yourselves.
An excessive amount of leftovers.
Yeah, that's just for people who take way more
than they're gonna eat.
Let's go, I'm starving.
That's a lot of cake.
You gonna be able to finish it?
Speak for yourself, Kagamin.
When it comes to cake,
this a perfectly normal amount for me to have, thank you.
Let's eat some cake!
Ah!
Mmm!
And that one, and that one!
Mmmm!
Okay, this is startin' to hurt, now.
We kept filling up our plates, and now we can't finish.
-Uh, I think I'm ready to pop. -Hmm.
But the lady said we'd be charged for the leftovers.
Yeah, we have to finish 'em.
I can't!
It's too painful.
Ah, our time's almost up.
Whoa, Kagamin, you're pounding two pieces at once.
Of course, I don't want to waste it!
--Don't do it! --Huh?
If you start drinking water now,
you're never gonna finish what's left on your plate.
You gotta focus on shoving down as much cake as you can.
Pack it in and when you're done,
then you can wash it down with some water.
--Uhh. --Don't just sit there!
Pick up your fork and suck down some more cake.
But I can't eat anymore.
You've got room for some pudding
or Bavarian cream, go on!
No, it's all you, have fun.
I'm gonna hurl if I take another bite, come on.
No way, I've retired from eating.
The pudding's gooey. You can slurp it.
Come on, hurry up!
I'm not having fun. I'm really not having fun.
Now that our exams are over,
I've been doing some serious game playing.
No wonder I'm so tired.
If you were only that hardcore about studying,
your test scores would be better.
These days, the dating sims I've been playing
have a ton of save points.
Thing is, I can't find a good place to stop.
I like to finish those things in one sitting.
Something's bugging me here.
If high schoolers aren't allowed to buy games like that,
how the heck do you buy them?
I don't buy that stuff. Dad buys it.
Whoa! Your family's gotta be
the weirdest family ever.
I can't believe you make your dad go out
and by that stuff for you.
That's why I'm all sleepy today.
I bet you're not that into gaming, are you, Miyuki-san?
Oh, well, we don't have any game consoles,
but there is a computer.
I do play a little on that.
Yeah, that's news to me.
What kinda games do you like to play?
Things like "Minesweeper" and "Solitaire."
I think those games are exciting.
Oh, Miyuki-san, sure they're called games,
but they're not really games.
I know what you mean.
I like when you're playing simple games like those,
you get totally sucked in.
Yuki-chan, what's your highest score so far?
On "Solitaire," I usually score over 10,000.
It's all about luck with that game.
And then in "Minesweeper," I cleared expert mode
in under 100 seconds.
Ah, she's the type
who plays that stuff all the time.
There sure was a lot of stuff happening
in sports this year.
Yes, for starters, that figure skater won
the gold medal at the Winter Olympics.
And then, there was that high school baseball tournament.
Wasn't it amazing how they had to go into extra innings?
Mm-hmm, and how about Prince Handkerchief?
If you're talking baseball,
there's also that player who left for America.
Hey, is this year's Japan series already over?
Yeah, for a while.
Ahh! No way! Were there any sales?
Relax, the series was
between the you-know-who's and that other team.
Neither of 'em owns department stores
or supermarkets or anything like that.
There was a commemorative sale, though.
Hmm, I bet it was a sale on hammers,
something like that. Mm-hmm.
I wonder if it was ham.
I just gotta make sure that next year,
I don't miss the sales.
Well, knowing you,
I bet you're just gonna load up on candy and stuff.
No way. I need to pick up stuff
like sugar, salt, soy sauce,
and all your basic household-y things.
Huh?
Oh, that's right, Kagami,
you wouldn't know about any of that, would you?
I suck at chores! I got it! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Eye drops, huh? You need any help with that?
Thank you, I'd really appreciate it.
Okay, lie back and look up.
Oh, okay.
Hi... now just relax.
Yes.
Here it comes.
Come on, relax, okay?
All right.
Sorry, I'm not doing this on purpose, really.
It's just that...
your face is scary.
Hmm? I've always had a problem
with giveaways and stuff, 'cause it takes forever
to get the thing you sent away for.
True, however, I found a way to milk
twice the enjoyment out of every giveaway I participate in.
How?
It's always fun in the beginning, like a festival,
but then nothing happens and you start to forget
about it and then it shows up and you're happy again.
One entry and twice the fun.
I guess if you really like something,
you can find the fun in it.
But I still hate the waiting-around-for-it part.
"Lucky Star."
Lucky Show!
Hi, luckies.
Hi, everybody, it's time
for another super happy episode of "Lucky Channel."
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami.
Can you believe we're already on our ninth episode?
Time sure flies.
And sitting over here, we have a certain someone
who our producer, Ito, is gonna say,
"Yo, Shiraishi, can you come here a second too?"
Why? What'd I do?
Oh, I'm Minoru Shiraishi giving 100%
of all I got as Akira-sama's assistant.
It's a pleasure to see you again.
Well, today we're gonna introduce another
character from the show,
Tsukasa Hiiragi. Where is it?
It's under the thing with the-- got it.
You sound like a nerdy turtle.
-Finally-- -Hiiragi-- I'm sorry.
Finally, things are picking up around here.
Yes, we're strapping on our loincloths
and gettin' down to business, right, Akira-sama?
Loincloths, huh? Yeah, since I'm an idol
and everything, stuff like that is a little,
you know. Just keep it mind is all, yeah?
Yeah, I'll do that.
Okay...
how about we give ourselves wedgies
with those loincloths?
So, I'm just gonna go out on a limb here,
and give you a piece of advice.
You're out on a limb?
If all you got as a comedian is toilet humor, you're done.
I didn't know I was a comedian.
And using other people's material is a no-no.
You do that a lot, cool it.
Okay. Okay, what are we talking about?
Oh, we were introducing Tsukasa Hiiragi.
Oh, yeah, that's the one who looks like the chick from...
- -..."To Heart," Akari Kamigishi.
Doesn't she?
I can't believe you'd say that.
What'd you mean, I think she kinda looks
like an idol from way back when, don't you?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
She does a little bit, okay, I see it.
She definitely has what it takes to become an idol.
If I didn't know better--
Are you high or something? Tsukasa Hiiragi's an idol?
You didn't have to throw an ashtray at me.
How long you been here, huh?
'Cause it blows my mind that you still have no concept
as to what a real idol is.
Learn your friggin' job.
-I'm sorry. -That girl is just
a soothing character type.
I mean, come on, with those droopy eyes
and that sad look, hello.
Okay, maybe she doesn't look happy.
Whatever, that hoochie's not what's important right now.
I'm gonna teach you once and for all,
right here and now, what an idol's all about.
We'll start with the posing basics.
Huh?
You know I'm doing this to help you out.
So it would be freaking awesome
if you could pay more attention while I'm flapping here.
-Yes, ma'am! -Here's how to deal
when you're ambushed by a bunch of cameras.
Okay, go ahead, push the button.
Droopy eyes and a sad look.
You see what I'm talking about?
And then, there's these props-- very essential.
It's a good thing for an idol to keep a few of these handy.
-Where? -There's times you'll
be walking down the street looking fabulous.
You never know when someone's gonna whip out
a camera and start shooting, so you gotta stay frosty.
And make sure your choppers are sparkly white.
-- --Theater.
Your eyes should be big and round,
and don't even think about blinking.
--Confined to this area only. --Psycho.
When posing, your expressions must be natural and organic.
For example, if someone lines up a medium close-up of you,
like this, "Akira so surprised!"
It's like that.
Right, very natural.
There's also a version of that pose
for when you and some guy are caught leaving a ho--
-- --Oh no!
It's time to say goodbye already?
Now, don't you guys forget to keep
sending in those cards and letters.
We really, really want to know what you think of the show,
and don't forget to let me know how much you love me too.
You can also shoot us an e-mail or call into the radio show.
Yes, we'll be seeing you all in the next episode.
Bye!
We had a photo shoot, didn't we?
That's right, we did.
I wore this little pink cardigan.
--Ooh! You were so cute. --Thank you.
--What's wrong? --Mmm, maybe not.
Well, everyone said it was cute.
But you were so into it, weren't you?
Yeah, I guess I was.
Bet you were having fun.
Well, I mean, looking up into the camera,
the hands folded under the chin pose.
Yeah, it was fun, yeah, yeah.
Ahh, you're totally hooked.
Totally, even the cross-dressing. Totally hooked.
Did you check the photos?
No, I haven't.
--Well, the manager did. --Yeah?
-She checked the photos. --Okay.
She said something about a couple of shots being...
problematic.
Well, I wouldn't worry too much about it.
I'm sure they got a ton of shots of me where I'm really h--
Sorry, that was a rookie move.
Let me make it up to you guys.
She says as she enters another song.
Give someone else a chance.
Okay, here.
You guys decide on something?
I'm still Looking.
I'm looking too, but I'm afraid
I don't know that many songs.
No sweat, I'll just sing until you're ready.
You think you could sing something else
besides an anime song?
You're in luck. It's not.
Huh? I heard this before.
What is it?
It's Kyon Kyon.
Me and my dad used to sing it all the time when I was a kid.
So, instead of an anime song,
you picked an oldie.
What? You're insulting Kyon Kyon
by calling this an oldie.
Look, Tsukasa, just pick an easy song.
Like a children's song.
Oh, yeah. I'm looking in that section. I'm so sorry.
No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.
We still got lots of time left.
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"...
Konata here, you know how in World 3-1
in "Super Bleep Bleep Brothers" when you get to the stairs
near the end of the level?
Well, there's that turtle over there, right?
All you have to do is stomp on it
and keep hitting your "A" button.
If you do that you can keep hoppin'
and jumpin' and kickin' that sucker
and get pretty much infinite lives.
Cool, right? But if you keep jumpin'
on that turtle and go over 129 lives, you die.
That's it, game over. No more lives.
What's up with that?
Hello, anyone else see a problem here?
Infinite lives means you live forever!
Anyway, I think it sucks,
but then again, maybe that's the point.
Maybe the guys in that building by Tofukuji Station,
are trying to teach us a lesson about moderation, you think?
Next time, "Desires."
Look forward to it!
Okay! Let's do this!
Sure! Let's go!
Quit screwin' around and start!
Look! They bought me a new cell phone!
Make sure you don't put it in the laundry this time.
You're right.
This time I'll keep it where I won't forget it.
Tsukasa! Could you help me out for a sec?
Okay. I'm coming!
--Ba... --
l...
...sa...
Irritated, irritated, irritated...
--...mic. --...irritated, irritated.
--Vine... --Super irritated.
--...gar! --Really, really irritated!
Ah! That's really irritating!
Just type it in already or let me do it!
No, thanks. I'm okay.
I can do it myself.
I'm here to hang out!
Hey! Come on in, Onee-san.
Whatcha playin' there?
It's a dating sim that just came out.
Huh.
I think I'm gonna pick a manga
and read that for a while.
Okay.
Uh-oh. This game's got an age restriction.
Either she doesn't know or she does,
but she's letting it slide.
Okay. Come on, Officer, which one is it?
Get this. We're having traffic safety week, right?
So we're taking in people like there's no tomorrow.
--Huh. --They're making us run
a check on every little thing,
and we gotta explain all the traffic laws.
It's a big-time pain in the butt if you ask me.
And the people even get mad at me for doing it!
Knowing you and how you act,
how's anyone supposed to take you seriously
about laws and safety?
Can you believe it? I sure can't!
I hear the cold that's been going around now
is lasting a long time.
I need to get better, fast.
According to the number I've taken,
it looks as though I'll be here for a while.
I'll just read a book until I'm called.
Mr. Ando! Mr. Shigeo Ando!
Ms. Takara! Ms. Miyuki Takara!
Ms. Takara! Is there a Ms. Takara here?
Okay. Is Ms. Mariko Nishiyama here?
Huh?
What? Did they call me?
What time is it? Oh no!
I need to pay more attention to my surroundings.
Coming up is Kamata, our last stop.
Huh? Oh, no! It happened again!
Where am I?
But in the end I still had to show Tsukasa
how to send text messages with her phone.
Even after messaging with it so much
she told me she never figured it out.
--Really? --Oh, yeah!
And now that she knows how it's done,
she's been texting me non-stop
with anything and everything she can think of.
It's gotta suck to be on the receiving end
of all of those texts, though.
--No, not really. --
I mean, I'm not gonna lose any sleep
worrying about it. You know?
Here's the thing.
At first she gets really excited about stuff,
but then she'll get bored and move on.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
Some people can be so childish sometimes.
Uh! I got another.
If she doesn't get bored soon,
you're gonna be hating life.
Wait. She can't have that much stuff to text you about.
I know. And we're together all the time anyway.
Oh! And she just discovered emoticons.
You see?
"You wanna buy the soy milk cream buns again
on our way home today?"
Hm? What's all that supposed to mean?
I don't know if you can tell,
but she's really having fun with emoticons.
Might as well be hieroglyphics.
Mmm?
Huh. Looks like she got used to doing it.
-- --Hm?
-- --
-- --Huh?
-- --
--Okay. --Oh, jeez!
I get you're having fun with it and stuff,
but you think you could text someone else for a change?
Hey. You guys got a minute?
Sure.
Well, I can't seem to figure out
how to send these text message things
--from my phone. --For real?
Oh, Dad. That's super easy.
Can't believe you don't know.
Okay. I'll totally teach you how.
Isn't it funny how people learn something new
then run out and brag about how much of an expert they are?
Uh, yeah.
There just aren't words to describe that hard stench.
I know. It stinks so bad.
--Yeah. --Huh?
Wow. You sure got a lot of people in your address book.
--Don't ya? -Hey! Don't look without asking!
You got stuff you don't want anyone to see or somethin'?
Not really. You just don't do that.
It's a guy, right? It's totally a guy!
No! It isn't a guy!
She's not picking up her cell phone.
Guess I'll try calling the house.
Hello, Kagami!
Hey, Konata?
You know. It'd be awesome if you could answer
your cell once in a while.
Yeah. Sorry 'bout that. The ringer's turned off,
so I didn't know you were calling me.
It's pointless to have a cell
if you never know anyone's calling.
Where the heck is that thing anyway?
See what I'm saying?
There's no point in you even having one.
Yeah. So, anyway, I wanted
to ask you about this coming weekend.
Wait. Hang on. Dad's calling me.
Come on. What's the deal? Hurry up!
I'll be there in a minute! Jeez.
You've been on the phone forever.
--Come on! --All right! Sorry!
Dad just chewed me up for being on the phone too long.
Oh, sorry.
I sorta always pictured your place to be kinda chill
when it came to stuff like that.
I guess it's pretty strict, huh?
Nah. We're just in the middle of playing
a cool fighting game, is all.
Ugh! Why didn't you say anything about that before?
Whether they're old or new,
point cards have magical powers in here.
And then, before I know what's happening
I'm buying all this stuff I never planned on.
But you never plan on anything anyway.
I get what you're coming from, though.
She's here!
In this city you've got...
...Ani-- and G--mers
She comes into our store,
buys something, then goes to the other shop
to buy the same thing again!
She's the one known as Legendary Girl "A"!
Heh.
Legendary Girl "A" shift assemble!
Yeah!
Welcome to the store!
We've got the "Haruhi" Volume 5 DVD in stock!
Limited Edition! Standard Edition!
We've got 'em both! Oh, yeah!
So, you want more stuff?
We've got stuff coming in all the time!
Yes, that's right.
Show her everything we've got.
The whole store.
She's gonna clean the place out. I can feel it.
Whoops. I was looking for the Limited Edition bookmark
from Aquarian Age. I gotta go Gamers.
This sucks!
"Lucky Star."
Awesome!
We'll have a sleepover this weekend
--and play games all night. --Cool.
Whenever we do this kinda stuff,
it's always gotta be at our house.
--How come we never go to yours? --Huh?
I'd just like to see where you live.
Hmm...
It's not that you can't come over to my house.
The reason I don't invite you
is 'cause my dad's always home on account of his job.
Oh. That makes sense.
Mm-hmm. Besides.
I don't wanna be held responsible
if anything happens, you know?
--No, I don't. --
I'm kinda looking forward to seeing
what's Konata's house is like.
Hey!
Hi, guys. Come on in.
Thanks for letting us stay the night.
We won't be any trouble.
Oh! It's my pleasure.
I've heard so much about you guys.
Like that you live in a shrine
and that you're a couple of shrine maidens.
What's she been telling him!
Ew! And this is the first thing he asks?
Here it is!
Wow! Look at Kona-chan's room!
I gotta hand it to ya. You're room's amazing.
Oh! She's so cute!
Where does this go?
Don't tell me. You don't want me to open this
'cause it's where you keep all the crazy junk
you're too embarrassed to put on display.
Go ahead and open it if you want. I don't care.
If you're lookin' for all my weird stuff
I usually keep it down in my dad's study.
I share it with him.
Uh. You guys share it?
Didn't you say your dad was writer
or something like that?
--Yep. --I bet you probably get hooked
on the light novels and dating sims your Dad writes.
--Don't you? --Oh, yeah.
Well, actually, my dad doesn't write that kinda stuff.
--Oh, really? --Yep.
Huh. I didn't expect that.
Well, I mean. Since he's a fan of stuff like that,
wouldn't he wanna write those kinds of stories?
No. My dad's kinda like a lurker.
He told me he didn't wanna write that stuff,
because he felt that, since his real life
was kinda like one of those nurturing sims,
he didn't wanna write about it and live it too.
Ever since I got here, it's been weird.
Yep. That's the Izumis.
So, get this.
The other day, my dad was being all clingy and stuff.
--Yeah? --So I'm all,
"You're actin' like an ass," just to see what he'd do.
Ugh! How can you talk to your dad like that?
Yeah, well, after I said it, Dad suggested I say,
"I hate you, Dad," or somethin'.
Yeah. I'm not sure about that either.
That's the point.
I don't think you appreciate the complexity
of my dad's way of thinking, Kagami.
Whatever. You totally lost me.
How 'bout we take a little break?
--It's here! --
Have you noticed lately,
how there's been a lot of 2chan speak on TV?
What's up with that?
Oh. There has?
I wouldn't know about that stuff.
-- --That's right!
I just realized you're this hard-core otaku,
but I've never heard you talk like that.
I don't normally.
But if I'm online I talk like this.
Whoa. Is that really Japanese?
I think I've failed if anybody can read it.
You want me to help with anything?
Sure. Do you wanna serve the salad for me?
Mm-hmm!
Huh?
Thank you for the food!
Yummy!
Yeah, you're right.
This stuff tastes amazing!
Whippin' up stuff like this isn't a big deal
if you do your chores.
If you helped out in the kitchen more, Kagami,
you'd cook like this too.
I don't need your advice.
Konata look! This is perfect!
Huh?
I always dreamed something like this would happen
and it has!
Huh?
--Oh, yeah. --
So, this is what's known
as the three high school girls
having dinner with a guy scenario.
And if you ask me, even for dating sims,
it's freakishly overused.
That's, well...
Doesn't it feel like evenings are getting colder?
Maybe I shoulda brought a jacket with me.
Look! A shooting star!
Huh?
Darn.
Tried, but I couldn't make my wish three times.
When they come out of nowhere like that,
it's kinda hard.
But someday I'll do it!
I'll wish fast enough,
and then it'll grant me a wish!
You'll always be a dreamer, Tsukasa.
Too bad stuff like that's impossible
when you stop to think about it.
Huh?
Whoever came up with it knew no one
could say their wish fast enough for it to work.
This one has absolutely no dreams whatsoever.
Are either of you guys thirsty?
Whoa! Thank you.
You switched hairdos.
Yeah. What do you think?
We did it for fun after we took our bath.
Hmm. Isn't it funny how the vibe you get
from something on one person
is different when it's on someone else?
Oh! A photo album! Can I look at it?
Sure, go ahead.
Wow! You're so cute, Kona-chan!
You haven't changed at all.
How old are you supposed be in this?
It's a cool shot.
I guess you and your dad are pretty close, huh?
Hmm? Oh! No. That's my mom!
She's a kid! I mean, so young!
Don't we look alike?
Yeah, like jailbait.
Every time I look at Dad
--I just can't help thinkin'. --What?
What part of my dad did my mom find so attractive
that she'd wanna marry him?
It's crazy how much you
and your mom look alike, though.
Do you like the same type of guy as your mom?
What is your type, anyway?
What's my type?
I don't know. I don't think I have one.
--Oh. Come on! You can tell me. --Wait!
Mom said that her and Dad were childhood friends first.
I don't think my mom was very picky
about the guy she liked.
Maybe that's a little harsh.
I bet she picked him 'cause she felt sorry for him.
Even with your parents, you're brutal.
You know, lookin' at this picture of Mom's
--got me thinkin'. --Mm-hmm?
These days you've got characters in manga and games,
like junior high kids, who seem really mature,
but the adults all act immature.
What's up with that?
Yeah, so?
You waiting for me to whip out a snide remark or something?
It's too bad Yuki-chan couldn't come over tonight.
Yeah. She had stuff to do, though.
I know! I'll text Yuki-chan.
That way she won't feel left out!
Maybe you shouldn't bug her.
Miyuki's probably busy doing something.
-- --That was quick.
"Glad to hear you're all having fun.
"Right now, I'm working hard and doing my best
"to finish my homework for the weekend.
If you do it again, I'll make sure to..."
I totally forgot we had homework to do!
Don't just sit there, Kagami. Do something!
I didn't have any homework.
Can I go to sleep now?
No! Wait!
-Oh! Remember the shooting star? --Yeah?
Maybe if I made shorter wishes I can get them to come true.
I don't know about that.
What you doin' over there?
I'm trying to figure out if there's a way
to say my wishes faster.
Stop running away from reality.
Hurry up and finish it.
Hey, Yuki-chan.
I didn't really understand this part today.
Can you show me how it's done?
Sure, I'd be glad to.
Kona-chan comes from Konata.
Yuki-chan comes from Miyuki.
Hmm...
Hey, Tsukasa, what kind of nickname
would you give Kagami? Kaga-chan? Gami-chan?
Uh. Hmm.
Kyou-chan might be good.
Kyou is another way to say Kagami.
Ah! That's a good call.
It's perfect 'cause it reflects
her tough-as-nails personality.
It could also work with this Kyou-chan.
But that's not what I meant when I said it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
I think it's best we don't mention this
to sis, you know?
How about it you gave yourself a nickname.
What would it be?
Tsuka-chan? Kasa-chan?
Hmm. How 'bout Hii-chan?
It's hard to make a nickname out of my first name.
That's perfect! 'Cause I can picture you as the type
who'd run around shrieking, "Hihi!" all the time.
That's not exactly what I meant either.
Right! From this day forward, Tsukasa,
--I'm calling you Hii-chan. --Huh?
What? What's wrong?
-What do you mean, "huh"? -
It's just that it's kinda weird, you know?
Picking your own nickname, and all.
--Then, how about that? --That?
Uh. I guess it doesn't matter.
Don't you want revenge, Sebastian?
--Shiraishi. --Hey, Kyou-chan! Kyou-chan!
What the heck are you saying? Are you calling me?
It's totally confusing, so stop it.
Okay. Then what do you want me to call you?
Isn't Kagami good enough?
Well, don't you wanna have a nickname too?
You know, like Kona-chan and Yuki-chan?
Hmm.
How 'bout Kagami-sama?
Uh.
Hey! Kagami-sama!
Ugh. Oh, no! She's using it.
Yeah, what?
I was just callin' ya.
Sorry for the wait, Kagami-sama.
What's wrong, Kagami-sama?
I'm sorry. It's my fault.
Just please call me by my name.
"Lucky Star."
"Lucky Channel"!
Hi, Luckies!
Wow! Isn't this great?
Can you guys believe that Lucky Channel's
surging forward with its tenth episode!
I'm Akira Kogami, your navigator.
Hello! I'm her assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
How 'bout we get down to business
by introducing the fourth character.
It's Kagami Hiiragi!
In the show, she's the one who plays
the rational character and keeps things on track.
So, basically she's a tsundere type. Yeah.
Right, I got it. Tsundere.
Talk about a shallow character.
On the contrary.
Huh?
Let's not jump to conclusions
by categorizing Kagami-san as a mere tsundere.
What is she then?
Before we get into that, we must ask ourselves,
do we truly grasp the concept of tsundere?
See, in this day and age, it's a sad fact
that as the term tsundere
becomes a part of the main-stream,
its true meaning gets lost in the process.
First we must trace its origins.
The term tsundere dates back to the year 2002,
where it was first used on the Internet.
It meant "a hostile person who becomes affectionate."
In other words, it was supposed to describe
how a character's personality changed over time!
Yeah, whatever.
These days, however, tsundere is used
to describe a character's dual nature.
For example, a girl who's cold on the outside
but loving on the inside would fit
the current definition of the term.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
I declare that this is all a huge mistake!
We must give the people back
the true definition of tsundere!
Sound the warning bells!
Rise up and be counted, you illiterate masses!
Arise!
You were going pretty good there, Sebastian.
Who's that?
So if Kagami isn't a tsundere, what is she?
Who's Sebastian?
I don't get why you're making it harder
than it needs to be, you know?
But since you brought it up, chief,
you got another word we can use
besides tsundere that gets the same point across?
What? Oh! Ah. I'm sure there's somethin'
out there that would work.
Maybe Cool-dere? No, that's not it.
Deretsun?
You really are an idiot, did you know that?
Isn't tsundere good enough?
No, it isn't. That's what I've been saying!
Oh! How 'bout we have our viewers
think of a new term that could replace tsundere?
Now, that's what I call a good idea.
Coward.
Listen up! This goes out to everyone watching right now.
I want you to come up with a new term
that would describe a character like Kagami.
And together we'll rewrite
the common facts of modern-day speech.
We'll call it The Great Tsundere Debate!
For more info, please check out our radio show
or log on to our site.
We're counting on your ideas!
Uh. So, are we done now?
'Bout freakin' time.
Lots and lots and lots and lots.
Bye-ni.
--Bye-ni! --
Fast forward!
Wow! I talked up a storm today.
That was the best show ever!
Uh. Akira-sama?
What's wrong?
Happy now?
Oh, yeah! I mean...
I got a lot of lines today.
I think I did a good job!
So, I'm gonna have dinner
with one of the producers and the president
of the production company.
--Huh? Oh! --Yeah.
We're gonna be talking about your future with the show.
Hold on a second. Wait!
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know if telling you is gonna help.
I mean, if I have to tell you, you already don't get it.
--Whoa! --You still got that
part time gig in , don't you?
Yeah, like during the day, I do.
But it's not like I'm getting rich working there.
And the Korean barbecue?
Well, yeah, I work there too, but--
Wait! No! That doesn't matter!
Just stop it! That's all private stuff!
Well, here I go.
What do you think about this song, Tsukasa?
Maybe. What do you think, Yuki-chan?
Yes, I know it.
Then, how 'bout you guys sing it next?
Thanks for finding it.
Yes, thank you.
At last.
Did you guys decide on a song?
Yeah!
Hey! Wasn't this song popular
back when we were in kindergarten?
No idea.
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know either.
I totally remember it.
Our sisters used to sing it a lot.
It's said that songs sung
by our parents or older siblings,
even though they're from a generation before us,
are the ones we remember the most.
Oh! She couldn't hit it.
I couldn't help it! It's too high.
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"!
Kagami here! Say you're out with a friend
and you're getting something to eat.
And everything's going great
until they bring out the soup.
There's always a little bit that splashes up, right?
Well, doesn't it suck when a drop gets on your clothes?
And if it's curry sauce it sucks even worse!
Doesn't it seem like it always happens
when you're wearing your favorite outfit?
And then it's like, you're totally bummed
for the rest of the day, you know?
It's like when you buy a bento box
with soup at the store.
You make sure to walk home all steady and careful,
keeping that bag level so nothing spills out, right?
Yeah. But then you get home and you open the bag
and the soup spilled out and everything's soaked,
and you're like, "I'm so not hungry anymore."
And you know how nice it is when they're bagging your stuff
and they bother to separate the cold things from the hot?
And then they screw it all up by putting the magazines you bought
in the same damn bag as all your cold drinks.
And then the paper soaks up all the condensation!
And now, you've got these warped and soggy magazines.
And you're thinking,
"Why the hell did they separate anything
in the first place?" You know?
Next episode,
"Various Ways to Spend Christmas Eve."
Look forward to it!
Okay! Let's do this!
Sure! Let's go!
Grr!
Quit screwin' around and start!
So the other day the three of us saw a shooting star,
then Kagami said that the whole wishing on it thing
impossible 'cause you can't wish
fast enough for it to work.
How nice! Shooting stars.
I rarely get to see them because the location
of my house isn't conducive to star gazing.
Oh yeah, that's right.
It's 'cause you live in the city, isn't it?
I would be so fascinated watching,
that I wouldn't be able to make a wish.
You feel so happy when you look up
and see all those beautiful brightly shining stars.
When you think about it, perhaps that explains the legend
that shooting stars grant wishes.
Your purity shines so brightly it's blinding me,
blinding me, I say!
Winter vacation's almost here.
But our finals come right before that.
Hey, Kagami, are you guys going anywhere over the vacation?
Uh-uh. Mmm, come to think of it,
we haven't done any traveling lately.
The other day, I took a trip to Asakusa.
Yeah? When did you go out there?
Well, don't you guys get sleepy
riding the train in winter?
She missed her stop?
Um, wait, isn't that in the opposite direction?
I slept so long, the train got to the final stop,
doubled back and went past my station again.
When I woke up I realized I was in Asakusa.
Oh, come on, there's got to be a limit
to how many times you can skip your station.
Missing your stop 'cause you overslept isn't a bad thing.
I mean, I got to take a little vacation to Asakusa.
You shouldn't be taking little vacations during exams.
For a minute there I thought I saw a girl
standing on the platform wearing
a sailor uniform and carrying a machine gun.
I wonder what the heck her problem was.
You're not gonna tell us you saw
someone get whacked, are you?
Besides, they say that kids who sleep a lot grow more!
Yeah, right, shorty.
There's someone else who's worse!
After pulling an all-nighter on a manuscript,
my dad took the morning train to go deliver it.
He fell asleep and missed his stop.
He slept all the way to the last stop,
then the train turned around, and before he knew it,
he slept his way back and forth a bunch of times!
He'd start to wake up whenever he'd get close to his stop,
but the poor guy always fell right back to sleep again.
All he wanted to do was come home and go to bed,
but he couldn't stay awake long enough to get off the train.
Wow.
And whenever dad got jostled by the train,
he'd wake up all startled, but then
he'd get all confused 'cause he couldn't
figure out which direction he was heading in.
Yeah, right.
Even if I fall asleep on the train,
I always wake up before I get to my stop.
That's amazing!
How do you know when to wake up?
Maybe she's got an internal alarm clock.
Although the one in her stomach seems to be broken.
What was that?
It's the one that gauges your candy intake.
Shut up!
You know how when you get on the train
and the seats are all warm?
Don't you get sleepy?
I know, that's so true.
It's just like when you're sitting in class
and you're by the window and it's
a sunny afternoon in winter.
It's warm, just like that!
It's like birds of a feather covering for each other.
No, it's nothing like that, really!
I tried waking her up on the ride home the other day.
Hey, come on, wake up, we're here.
Yeah, give me five minutes.
Just five more.
She said out loud in her sleep
and then everyone around us started laughing.
That's so weird, I have a friend
who totally said the same thing in class one day.
Oh brother, you guys are birds of a feather all right.
Ah, no we're not!
Why do we ask for five more minutes?
Maybe 'cause you'd get upset if you tried waking
someone up and they said, "Hey, give me another hour."
I guess, but asking for five more minutes
is something that comes up in other things too,
besides sleeping, like hang on for five minutes.
Yeah, I guess.
Maybe we use it a lot because it's not too long
or too short, but if you wait five minutes
for a train, it feels like forever.
Yeah, you're right.
Well, maybe.
The thing is though, whenever someone says
just five more minutes, it never ends up
being five more minutes, does it now?
You know how they tell you that you can't
use your cell phone or put makeup on
while riding on the train?
Well, I think it's way worse when you're
sitting there and a total stranger's
all leaning up against you.
Yeah, sometimes they're so heavy
that even though it took you a while
to get a seat you'd rather stand.
Or when it's some old person with
a sticky face leaning on you.
Sometimes, I'm all, "Lean that way,"
but it doesn't work.
No matter how many times they adjust their posture,
they always end up leaning against me again.
I know, I know, isn't that weird?
This one time I was asleep,
there was a middle aged guy sitting here
and there was an empty seat sitting here.
I was trying to lean toward the empty seat,
but I always ended up leaning on
the middle aged guy instead.
Maybe everyone's got a particular side
they like leaning on or something.
Whenever I'm in a spot where someone's leaning on me,
I'll tuck myself in really tight just like this,
but then they start jabbing away at me with their elbows.
You really think they're asleep when they do that?
What? You mean they're not?
See ya.
Bye-ni!
Goodbye.
Oh wait, before you guys go,
you know how some folks at school take the up train,
and then you got other students who take the down to get home?
Yeah.
Don't you think that all the people taking
the up train look way more sophisticated
than the ones taking the down?
That sounds just like Yuki-chan.
No, it's not like that.
All right, young ladies, I better
bust a move back to shanty town.
Hm?
Wha...
Huh?
This isn't my stop, it's the next one.
Hey guys, what's up?
Yo.
Ah, for some reason,
I couldn't study at all last night.
Ooh, well, I on the other hand, studied my brains out
last night so I'm feeling pretty darn stoked right now.
Good for you. How long did you study for?
-Only four hours. -A whole four hours!
What the...?
Kagami, you do
everything perfect, you know that?
Not that I'm bragging or anything,
but just between you and me,
I do a heck of a lot of studying.
When it comes right down to it,
you're pretty competitive, aren't you, Kagami?
Well, I guess it might be my pride
at being the older sister.
I always felt that pressure and that's why I work hard,
to stay a step ahead of Tsukasa.
I know I always tell her that being
older or younger doesn't really matter,
but I used to think about it a lot.
But does it even matter with Tsukasa?
I mean, where's the challenge?
Um, well, yeah, I guess there isn't any.
Damn you, Kona-chan!
Christmas is almost here.
I wonder what kind of present I'm gonna get this year.
You still get presents?
That's so awesome!
How old were you when you found out
there really wasn't any Santa Claus?
Huh, you mean there's no such thing as Santa Claus?
For real?
Did you know Santa never came by Kona-chan's house?
Her dad tells her Santa gives him gifts to give to her.
That way she thinks Santa's really out there.
Her old man really wants to look good
in front of his daughter, doesn't he?
How's it going, Hiiragi?
Oh, hey.
Hiiragi-san, I have yesterday's printout.
Oh, yeah, sure.
It's like that, Hiiragi-chan.
Wait, Hiiragi, you dropped your pencil.
Oh, thanks a lot.
Hiya, Kagami!
Oh, hey.
Kagami-san, here's yesterday's printout.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Sebastian's stinky, isn't he?
Hey, Kagami, you dropped your handkerchief.
For real?
Geez, I guess I hang out in Tsukasa's
class more than I thought.
You know my cavity's been hurting a lot lately.
Oh, how can you stand it?
You know how I totally hate the dentist.
Oh yeah, you went to get a cavity fixed the other day.
Is it all better?
You know how dentists are.
Once you're in their clutches,
they take a long time to fix one tooth,
and then after they finish working on it,
they find another tooth that
desperately needs their attention.
So after making a number of excuses,
I got up and ran away as fast as I could.
What's a girl to do?
She's all cute when she says it but that's totally nuts!
Hey, Konata.
How about we all get together and throw a Christmas party?
Oh, sorry, but I've already got plans for Christmas.
Really? Do these plans involve a guy?
Well, you could say that.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Are you and your dad going out someplace?
Good try, but I did tell him
that I'd be coming home late that night.
No way, you're going out on a date with some guy?
When did you get a--
Sorry to burst your bubble, girls,
but I got a part-time job, remember?
Phew.
But I wasn't really lying, 'cause
most of the customers are guys, right?
I thought you snuck ahead of us there.
Yeah, so did I.
Every year at Christmas the cafe puts on this event
where all of us get dressed up like
Santa Claus for the customers.
You really do like that kind of stuff, don't ya?
Hm, so do you.
Every New Year's Eve don't the two of you
go to your family's shrine and cosplay as shrine maidens?
Do not call it cosplay.
Getting back to Santa, it's awesome
that he gives out presents,
but that guy's totally breaking and entering.
I mean when I was a kid, that really freaked me out.
I wouldn't go around insulting
the legacy of a saint if I were you, you horrid child.
Whoa, hang on.
Huh?
Santa gives kids what they wish for
and she's going to dress up like Santa.
So what kind of men have wishes
that a Santa squirt like her can grant?
Oh, rolling out the casual insults, are we?
Come to think of it, are you guys
even allowed to celebrate Christmas?
Yeah, we've got Christmas presents
just like all the other kids.
Back at our house, we were brought up
to respect all kinds of deities.
Our family goes and visits temples all the time,
and we've even sung a hymn or two in a church.
Wow, you guys are so well-rounded.
Yeah, but then our big sister who's a shrine maiden too,
she told me that when she got married
it'd be in a wedding dress.
I wonder how Mom and Dad are gonna feel about that.
Whoa, hang on.
Sounds like it's gonna get complicated.
Lucky Star.
Yoo-hoo!
Boy, it's getting cold out there.
Hey there, Nee-san.
Come on in.
What you watching, huh?
Just one of those detective drama shows.
Oh, is it anything good?
No, not really.
There's nothing else on.
That's it, I got it. That guy did it!
One moment please, Detective.
Don't you think there's
something strange about this case?
'Course not, this solves it!
Who are you anyway?
This ain't your business.
Oh brother, that's a perfect example
of why the cops are such morons.
But aren't you one of those cops?
Perfect timing, Mr. Telephone.
We're almost at the part of the show
where the bad guy confesses everything.
How do you know that?
Look.
So, I guess you're the one who did it.
Yeah, whatever, I give up.
Can somebody please tell me why the hell
every cop show has to end at the top of a cliff?
Maybe it's 'cause people can't get themselves
to go through with anything
unless they've been pushed to the edge of a cliff.
Yoo-hoo, hey, how's it going?
I'm hanging in there, Nee-san.
So, what are you watching tonight?
It's the movie version of a popular detective show.
Dad rented it for us.
The case isn't here in the boardroom,
it's out there at the crime scene.
No, no, no, no, that's totally wrong.
Like police work ever gets that passionate.
You sound pretty passionate.
If I remember this thing right,
the thief isn't the guy who stole the receipt,
it's some other guy who was hired by the police chief.
Wanna know how you screwed up, Chief? That's how.
You're talking about the show, right?
You know, people are always eating pork bowls
on cop shows, but I heard that doesn't happen in real life.
Of course not.
Everyone knows most of that stuff's made up.
You mean the Metro Police chief
doesn't really have that many granddaughters?
Ugh, the chief's got granddaughters?
That's the first I've heard of it.
If anything, I'd want Mai to be real.
That's all I'd wish for.
And what an empty wish it is.
Hmm, hmm, hmm...
I can't believe all the cases of adults attacking children.
It's so horrible.
Wanna know what I think about that?
Martial arts!
If you make every kid learn martial arts,
stuff like that won't happen as much, right?
Look at Oyama-sensei.
After years of intense training--
hi-ya-- he was able to beat down a cow
with one bare-handed slap!
And every day he works out by giving
20 bears a pounding!
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's all good, but I don't think
it's very smart in the long run.
I mean, when those kids grow up,
they're going to turn into some butt-kicking adults.
Oh, yeah.
But on the other hand, they say that
when someone practices martial arts,
they grow up to be a more mature
and level-headed person.
Oh, they do huh? Really?
'Cause there's someone right in front of me
who practices martial arts and she's anything but mature.
That's not very nice.
Okay, you guys, I got a news flash.
Yui Nee-san has a little sister
who's gonna be starting high school next year.
She's always been kind of frail,
but she's a really nice girl,
and she's super cute!
Cool.
But there's something that bothers me about her.
If you buy into that proverb,
a healthy spirit leads to a healthy body,
I can't help but think there must be
something dark and sinister hiding
behind her pretty little eyes.
I doubt that everything happens
the way the proverbs say.
You're living proof of that.
Can you believe this year's almost up?
Every time December comes around,
I feel like the year flew by.
This year, are you guys gonna help
your folks by doing the shrine maiden thing again?
Of course.
You should come and pick your fortune.
Oh yeah, those. If you pick
an unlucky scroll, you feel lousy about it
and then you get all depressed.
But if you pick a great blessing scroll, doesn't it
feel like you totally wasted your good luck for the year?
That's why they say that middle blessings
are the best to get.
Alrighty, class, 'tis the season for presents,
and as your teacher, I got you some report cards!
How'd you do, Kona-chan?
Thank you, ma'am, but I don't want this present.
It's my policy as Santa to hand out those presents
to show you how hard you worked in class, so enjoy it!
Hope you like the homework you get over vacation, too.
I wonder what kind of Christmas cakes
they're gonna have out this year?
When you go into a bakery around this time,
there's so many cakes.
Just looking at all of them is so much fun, isn't it?
I wonder what happens to all the leftover cakes
after Christmas ends.
Perhaps the bakery lets the employees
take them home to their families.
If nobody wants to take 'em home,
then they'll throw out the extra cake.
That reminds me of how they compare Christmas
and the prime age for marriage.
Like it's over after 25?
Up until the 25th, Christmas cakes are the best,
but the day after Christmas,
you're looking at the same cake differently.
Suddenly all those decorated cakes don't seem
so yummy and you just don't feel like eating 'em anymore.
Me and Kona-chan were talking about Santa the other day.
So when did you stop believing in Santa, Yuki-chan?
I bet you were like me and believed in him
for a long time, didn't you?
It's true, I did believe in Santa when I was younger.
In fact, I wanted to write Santa a thank you letter for
all the wonderful gifts, so I decided to do some research.
I tried asking my parents about him,
but that didn't lead anywhere.
So I did some more investigating.
And I came across phrases like stories
that Santa Claus was based on in the origin of Santa.
Needless to say, my dreams were shattered early on.
How'd you do, Miyuki-san? Let me see!
Whoa.
That's our Yuki-chan.
Wish I could get grades like that.
Getting blown away like this is
really starting to piss me off.
Oh, come on, Yuki-chan's always at the top of our class.
We'll never get grades like her.
I'm not talking about grades,
I'm talking about breast size.
I mean, did you get a load of hers?
I'm getting hungry.
I guess I'll have a cup of ramen.
Not yet?
Oh, it feels like an eternity.
This is the longest three minutes ever.
I'll pass the time by reading my manga.
And then your noodles end up all
soggy and everything, you know?
I know, it's like instant yakisoba
soaking up all the water!
Give me a break.
I knew she was gonna be late, but this is ridiculous.
I can't let this become a habit.
Here's where I need to be a dad
and stop this before it gets out of hand.
I'm home!
Konata, get your butt in here!
Do you even care what time it--
Merry Christmas!
Here's a Christmas present from me to you, Daddy.
I hope you like it.
I bet you're cold from being out so late.
You want some tea, honey bunny?
Yeah, you know it!
I'm so happy, I think I could die now.
Hi! What up?
Yui Nee-san's in the house!
You totally reek.
You didn't drive, did you?
No, I parked the car and hit the bar, man!
Can you believe this? It's like Christmas Eve,
but my husband isn't even home.
It was gonna be our special night.
Couldn't you go visit your folks
once in a while instead of coming here?
Yui? Oh hey, it's me.
I was gonna surprise you tonight,
but yeah, the door's locked. Are you with your parents?
I'm coming home!
I'll be there in a flash, baby, turbo style!
I won't stop for any traffic lights either!
Don't go breaking any laws in your condition there, tiger.
I can take her home.
I'm not ready for bed yet, so I think I'll log on.
Hey, teacher's online.
Hey, ma'am, let's have ourselves a riot.
All night long, that okay?
Just a minute, please.
You are not a leftover.
You are not a leftover.
'Cause I bought you.
Yeah, I came down here last Sunday too.
I bought some manga.
The train fare down must really add up.
I know you do it for the points
and all, but that's hardcore.
You really love this.
And do you even use any of the
prizes you get from that stuff? Seriously.
Mm-mm, I don't use any of 'em.
Well, I guess it would be kind of hard
to use that stuff after all the effort it took to get it.
You know it. It'd be a waste to use it.
Using it makes it less valuable! Don't you know that?
Okay, if that's how you feel about it.
No!
Yes.
Didn't you get shocked by the static?
Uh-uh.
Well, why didn't you?
She spends so much time in front of the computer
she probably absorbed all kinds of weird electric waves.
Static is the worst thing about winter time.
You can get shocked just by touching someone,
even if you barely touch 'em.
Maybe these guys don't like each
other after all, for real.
Ah!
What the heck are you doing?
I just wanted to try it again.
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, luckies!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
It's already the eleventh episode,
guys, can you believe it?
And since it's the 11th episode,
I can finally tell you the fantastic gabalicious news that
-you've all been waiting for! -Yeah, um...
We've gotten lots of comments from passionate fans--
-She's ignoring me as usual. -Really want to see Akira-san
in the main segment of the show,
and there were so many of you out there
wanting me that it couldn't be ignored!
Hi guys, I'm Minoru Shiraishi, the assistant to Aki--
Shut the hell up.
I'm going to make an appearance in the show!
I want to thank Miss Konata Izumi from Saitama
who sent her postcard into Newtype,
oh, and everyone else, thank you, thank you.
Wow, you got cast too, Akira-sama?
Huh?
Yeah, what's with the attitude?
Like, oh, you're finally getting a spot
in the show in like episode 12,
but I was in the show this whole time, huh?
What's up with that?
No, that's not it!
I swear, I'm totally honored that I'll be acting
in the show with you, Akira-sama, believe me!
Hmph, acting in the show, he says.
All you did today was pick up a handkerchief.
Oh, how you dream about making it in the industry,
but you're totally expendable and you
could disappear like that!
Keep that in mind and maybe you'll
stick around a bit longer!
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.
After an announcement like that,
I bet you can't wait to see the next episode.
You want to see it now, huh, do ya, do ya?
Everyone's trembling, no, naked
and trembling, waiting to see it!
I know, let's air it right now!
We can't tease the fans like this!
Come on, you guys, let's give 'em what they want!
All we need's a 30-minute block to do it.
We can steal a 30 from the next show, right, guys?
Oh well, I guess that's it then.
I want to hear from you guys, so call into
our radio show or log on to our website, okay?
Bye-ni!
Bye-ni!
Oh, what am I gonna do?
It won't be cool if I upstage the main characters.
I heard that, I've seen it happen before.
The main character's friend or the bad guy.
Basically, whoever isn't the main character,
they end up being more popular.
Uh, Akira-sama, what's wrong?
So, you're talking about yourself?
You're talking about you?
You got a big fat head now 'cause you're the popular one?
No, it's not like that!
They gonna make an action figure out of you?
No, no they're not!
What are you talking about?
I never said-- Hang on a second, please.
Stop it and hear me out!
Yay, looks like Miyuki-san and
Tsukasa's duet's coming up next.
Yuki-chan, let's go sing up front.
Uh, sure.
Huh, I can't believe you actually
picked a song that Tsukasa and Miyuki both know.
Oh, I know a whole lot of songs.
All types, too.
That's an anime song.
When you need to pick a song
in a hurry, anime song's are the way to go.
On the next episode of "Lucky Star."
Tsukasa here.
Okay, so a couple of nights ago,
I got really, really hungry, but since
it was so late at night, I mean, like, really late,
I didn't know if I should eat something or not, you know?
Anyway, I figured a little bite wouldn't hurt,
so I went to go get something.
Well, I went to the kitchen and I opened the fridge,
and I was thinking about these pastries
I had that I saved and--
Oh, that's it?
Next time:
Let's Go to the Festival!
Look forward to it!
Okay, let's do this!
-Sure, let's go. -Grr!
Quit screwin' around and start!
♪ Miyuki-san! ♪
Are you gonna be doing anything fun on New Year's Eve?
Oh, why do you ask?
There's a super cool festival going on.
Want to come with me? What do you say?
A festival for the new year?
That does sound like a lot of fun.
Oh yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Oh, I wonder if it's anything like the Snow Festival.
Unfortunately, I'm going to visit with my family.
-Ah, perfect timing. -
I couldn't help but overhear,
but didn't I get the same invite from you last summer?
Did you, Kagami-san?
Here's a translation of Konata's jibber-jabber.
She wants you to run around and buy stuff
at that Comiket thing.
When I went this past summer, it blew my mind.
I wasn't lying, though.
I mean, a festival's a festival, right?
Besides, going alone is no fun.
It's a lot of work.
Hello? Izumi residence.
Hey, what's up?
I was just doing my New Years cards,
and I wasn't sure if you were still in mourning.
I didn't get a decline note from you yet.
Hm? We're not in mourning.
What made you think that?
What are you talking about?
You took a couple days off from school this year
'cause you were in mourning, weren't you?
Oh, that.
Yeah, I remember.
We're doing much better now.
I cannot believe you'd use such a cheap trick!
Shiny, happy.
I'm kind of right in the middle
of our big house cleaning now, so--
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
I'd hate to keep you away
from all that dusting you got going on.
-But-- -Later!
-Yeah. -
This sucks.
Ah! Why is it that whenever you got stuff to do
that you don't want to do you go into cleaning mode?
And why is it that when you do start cleaning,
you realize that you'd rather be doing something else?
Hey, Konata, less breaks, more cleaning, okay?
Why is it called Comiket, huh?
I know it's a big festival and all,
but don't you think it starts too early in the morning?
I can't wait to see it!
You have no idea what you're getting into, do you?
I pity you.
Ah, she'll get used to it in no time.
Tsukasa, I gotta warn you that this thing's
gonna wear you out, like in all kinds of ways.
You okay with that?
Mm. Mm-hmm! Don't worry, I'm good.
Something tells me you don't really understand.
Unbelievable.
The train's being overrun by otaku.
Be patient! The light will turn green momentarily.
Hey, sis, I'm getting really scared.
I hate to say I told you so.
Okay, here's the part where I give
the two of you your assignments for today.
Assignments?
Assignments, here are your shopping lists.
When we get in there, we're gonna split up.
Then we're gonna hit all the tables
in the order shown on this map.
You guys take sections one to three in the east hall,
I'll take four to six.
But, you have to be careful.
I've indicated your route in red ink on the map.
If you don't stick to the route,
you're going to get caught between the lines
for the tables that are along the walls,
like right here and here.
If the two of you get stuck in the crowds in this area,
you're going to lose at least 30 minutes.
I dunno, this looks sketchy to me.
Can't we just hang out?
Oh, come on, you'll be fine.
Look, the tables marked in green
are the ones you can leave until the afternoon.
These guys won't sell out of stuff that quick
'cause they usually have a lot of stock on hand, okay?
Concentrate on getting to all the tables
marked in red before the morning's over.
"S" is for new, "K" is for previously published.
If you're not sure, just buy one of everything they have.
Doesn't matter if it's new or not.
-Here's your ammo, men. -Huh?
It's cash, 'cause you don't want
to be fiddling with your wallets during checkout.
The cafe au lait is to keep your sugar level up.
Take a drink every 30 minutes.
-This is our rally point. -Huh?
Meet me here at exactly 1300 hours.
- -
I'll wait for you for 15 minutes.
If you don't show, then I'll know
to go look for you in first aid.
That's it. Any questions?
I got a question.
How come your passion and intellect
only pop out when you're being a total fangirl?
- -Please, don't run!
Climax from the get go!
The new issue is limited to four per person.
That's four copies per person!
Behave yourselves!
Um, excuse me.
Hi, I was wondering if this was A92?
Indeed it is.
Hi, you're getting one each of the new issues?
1,000 yen please.
You were saying?
Oh right, sorry.
I was looking for your new issues.
Perfect, the new issues are this one
and that one, and they're both 500 yen.
Ah, thanks for the help today.
You like the cookies I made?
You loved them, didn't you?
Oh, that's awesome.
Can I have three copies of each?
Absolutely!
"Slippery Brigade Leader" and "The Naughty Captain."
-Enjoy! 3,000 yen please. -Ah!
I'll take all of these, please.
Sure, that'll be 4,500 yen, please.
Here you go.
Thanks for you business, hope you like 'em.
Tango down, proceeding to the next target.
I wonder if I'm in the east hall now.
If I am, that means north is that way so then-- oh boy.
Ah! No, no, wait a minute! Please! Oh no!
Um, excuse me, but I need to go that way! Ah!
All right, I guess I've covered
pretty much all the big ones.
Let's see, where should I go to next?
Huh?
Oh.
A little peek won't hurt.
Wah!
Gauron's really sticking it to Sousuke.
No way!
You like it?
You can take it home for 500 yen.
Um, ah... it's too stimulating.
Huh?
No way, it's her!
The legendary girl "A."
Relax!
She'll think something's up if you start freaking out.
Right. You're right, I know.
But I heard that whenever she comes here
and buys stuff, whoever she buys from,
their books suddenly get popular!
How could I not be excited about her?
Dude, I know!
I want her to buy one as bad as you do!
We worked our butts off on this issue.
Yeah, we did, didn't we?
We took time off of work and everything
just to make this issue rock like a mother.
This is our year.
-Can you feel it? -Can I check it out?
Yeah, sure!
Hm.
What do you think? How is it?
It's pretty cool, isn't it?
We put a lot of work into the scene with the live show.
Hm, needs work.
- -Thanks anyway, guys.
Don't cry, there's always next summer.
'Scuse me, can you help me?
Sure, what can I do for you?
I'm kinda lost and I'm looking for Pu-61.
Which way is it?
Oh, I think you'll find the Pu section in the east hall.
How do I get to the east hall?
This is the west hall.
You need to get in that line over there, and head upstairs.
That'll take you right over to the east hall.
How long do you think it'll take for me to get there?
Hm, right now?
I think it'll take about an hour.
Okay, that's all.
I'm sorry, Kona-chan.
I got lost and then I had to escape
from this place called the west hall.
I wasn't paying attention and I got
washed away by the crowd.
What kind of place is this?
I had to stand in line for the bathroom
and it took an hour.
I figured the little shopping list I gave you
was gonna be too much for a first timer.
It's all good. Let's take it easy
and look around for the rest of the day.
She hasn't had enough?
I have to say though, since they moved
the festival to Ariake, it's gotten better.
You should've seen it before.
Back in the day when it was held in Harumi Hall
there were only two convenience stores in the area.
Oh, back in the day, huh?
Mm-hmm, I think the last time they held it
in Harumi Hall was like 12 years ago?
-Huh? -Whoa! Hold on a sec.
-How old were you? -Hm?
I was about five.
It was great, my dad always used to take me there.
We'd spend a couple nights
in this place called the Hotel Urashima.
The first time he took me was a Summer Comiket.
The second floor of the new hall was totally awesome!
The sweat from all the people in there evaporated
-and rose to the ceiling. -
Then it turned into this huge cloud of steam!
- -Yeah, too much information.
Ever since they started having this thing in Ariake,
it's gotten better and better.
But because it's gotten so big, all the younger people
who come here act like this is some kind of supermarket.
That breaks my heart 'cause they totally miss the point of it!
This event was supposed to be something
the fans all did together.
Sorry to interrupt your nostalgia,
but I don't get any of it, at all.
Huh?
I didn't see this last summer.
Do they always have something like this?
Mm-hmm, although by now
most of the good stuff's all sold out.
Hm.
-Look, you guys, it's Nagato! -Huh?
It's the real Nagamon, and she's selling stuff!
Who? What are you talking about?
What do you mean you sold out of Haruhi stuff?
You're pissing me off, kid!
Give me my Nagato phone card!
Geez. What an ass.
As I was saying before, there's a lot more
of that type coming here these days.
I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you
but the limited edition items we had for sale
have completely sold out!
What? You gotta be kidding me!
I am not kidding.
That's what happens when you get here late.
-Who's that? -Sorry, kid, but you have
to line up in the morning if you want to get--
You idiot!
Asia.
Hey, what the hell?
You will do your best to make the customers happy,
even if they show up late.
You're showing a complete lack of spirit!
But-- but we sold out of the limited-edition things.
We've only got leftovers and old stock!
Did you just say leftovers?
There's no such thing as leftovers!
Don't let the flashy trends and cheap moe urges fool you!
Comiket is here to show you the true value
of your so-called leftovers!
And now, after all the limited edition
thingies have been sold,
the real battle between corporate booths
is about to begin!
I-- I didn't know.
Well, don't you have a suggestion for this customer?
The best you have, sir, and be quick about it!
Something. Isn't there a weapon?
Well, how about something like this?
No, this is more like it!
You see? Nagato sold out.
Everyone sold out, but do you see this?
Even Koizumi sold out.
Silence, how do you think I feel?
This is three years old.
The Captain card sold out the first day.
Well, kid, you want to buy a Kyun card?
No, Sousuke's the one for you!
I was looking for the Coco Saikube card.
You idiots!
It's the company president...
Mr. Takahashi!
Right, I am the company president, Mr. Takahashi.
And I overheard what you two were telling this kid.
That booth's always got something crazy going on.
R-really?
...unsuspecting customers,
well, I can't allow that.
But, sir, both of them are main characters.
Lucky Star!
I'm so tired.
I know, I'm tired too.
I wish we didn't have to come here right after Comiket.
How can they have an event like that
right on New Year's Eve?
Kagami, Tsukasa, Happy New Year!
-Hey. -Hi, Kona-chan.
Happy New Year to you, too.
I can't believe you're still standing
after a crazy day like today.
Besides, it's so cold I figured you'd stay home.
Yeah, well, you got a point there.
But it's a new year and you have to start it off right!
The idea's to visit the shrine and get yourself
charged up for the coming year.
Wow, that's admirable.
-I know, my dad said it. -Hello.
Suddenly, I'm feeling weird about it.
And your outfit's looking hot!
Oh yeah.
Stuff like this, stuff like that.
Okay, I'm all done praying.
Oh, well great, good for you.
Have you guys finished with all your prayers
and stuff for the night?
Hey, sis, what were you
so feverishly praying for a little while ago?
What? You don't have to broadcast it to everyone.
And I wasn't that feverish about it.
I-- I was just thinking how nice it would be
if I could be in the same class
as you and Miyuki, that's all it was.
Hm?
Don't forget Kona-chan's there too.
That's so adorable!
I never knew you had a cute side, Kagami.
Shut up, you! I didn't say anything
'cause I knew you'd tease me about it!
And the way you resist your cuteness is also cute!
-What about it? -You've always been
in a different class than the rest of us.
Maybe it's because Ms. Kuroi doesn't like me or something.
I know! I'm gonna go say a prayer
so that the two of us can be in the same class together.
Really, Tsukasa?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Kagami needs to be in a different class.
-Huh, but why? -Elementary!
We need you there so we can borrow your stuff
and copy your homework without getting caught!
Besides, if you're in the same class as me,
my ranking's gonna drop.
Maybe you should be in a different class, weirdo.
-Yeah right. -Anyway, we saw Sebas--
Schoolgirls are the best! The best!
Will you and your dad be buying fortunes this year?
Yeah, you know it. That's why we're here.
Oh!
Your new year is looking good right from the get-go.
I'll say. Everywhere I look it's good.
This is gonna be a great year, I know it.
-Oh, it'll be all right. -
Even though the fortune you picked is horrible,
it can only get better, you know?
Good things will happen.
Sure, yeah, whatever you say.
I guess it's how you look at it.
Thanks a lot!
If you're worried about it,
you could tie it to a branch to lift the curse.
Hm, yeah, I'll do that.
Whoa! You gotta be kidding!
Whoa! More of 'em!
Ah, I found a spot!
I guess this is what they call being cursed.
Yeah.
Look, whether good things happen or not,
it all depends on you in the end.
A fortune is nothing more than a game of luck.
Yeah, I guess, but you're a shrine maiden.
I didn't know you could say something like that.
I know, I can collect all the fortunes,
from great curses to great blessings.
Those things are not trading cards.
Maybe I could even find a secret fortune, too.
Oh, come on, secret fortunes?
What the heck is a secret fortune?
Maybe an ultra great curse!
It's a curse. Who'd want to collect something like that?
I beg to differ.
You want to collect 'em all, 'cause if you do,
you get a limited edition prize.
There is nothing like that.
I've been wanting to ask you something ever since
I saw that huge Kagami-mochi.
That really big one?
I was wondering if that's where the name Kagami came from?
Well, yeah, I guess you can say it does.
Kagami-mochi is round,
the same shape as an old-fashioned mirror.
And for a long time now, people have believed
that mirrors were where the gods lived.
See, that's why my parents named me Kagami,
because they hoped that my life
would be blessed by the gods.
By the way, its shape symbolizes a well-rounded family, too.
Her name's got all these mystical origins,
so can someone please tell me how
she grew up to be such a hardcore realist?
Hmm.
-Ah! -You want one?
-Mmm. -They're nice!
There sure are a lot of worshipers.
Yeah, well, it is New Year's Eve.
This is nothing compared to other shrines.
I bet most of 'em are here for the same reason as Dad.
They just want to check out all the shrine maidens.
Oh, come on!
There aren't that many pervs here.
I guess.
I guess it's that time again.
It's the first day of the new year
and time to start things off right.
Have a Happy New Year, Dad.
I hope you have the best year ever.
Happy New Year, hon.
Yeah, Happy New Year!
How's it going, everybody?
I'm Du! How about this beautiful location, huh?
Isn't it great?
It's fantastic!
Ooh, look at that pretty flower!
-There's so many flowers. -
I made some tea, Dad. Do you want some?
Sure, I'll have a cup.
-Here you go. -Oh, thanks a lot, kiddo.
Dad, do you want to play this game with me?
Dad, do you want a bowl of rice cake soup?
Hey, Dad, how about--
Yeah, well, I guess Dad thought it was cute,
the way I was bugging him. Can you believe that?
I got my New Year's allowance, though.
He sure wore me out.
Ah, yeah, I bet.
You guys are totally weird for each other, aren't you?
And now that my New Year's allowance
has been secured, I think I'm gonna
head over to Gamers right now and spend it.
Right.
Oh, it's a pain stores like that
aren't open out here in the sticks.
I mean, I'm a little strapped for cash these days.
And the train ride isn't cheap.
I wish there was a store like that around here.
Don't most stores have websites you can order stuff from?
Ever think of doing that?
I mean these days you can pretty much order anything online.
You just don't get it, do you?
Yeah, shopping online's okay
'cause you can get points and stuff,
but looking around's the best part of going into the store.
There's always a chance you'll find something unexpected that--
What is wrong with you?
All you want to do is spend your money!
Daikon radish gets all nice and done.
I wonder why people call these things "Pochi Bukuro."
I know. "Pochitto" means "a tiny amount,"
and "koreppocchi" means "a bit."
It's a bag you put your loose change in.
Oh.
Western Japan calls it "pochitto,"
and "koreppocchi" is how you say it in eastern Japan.
Best wishes for a safe and happy New Year.
Miyuki speaking.
Hi, Miyuki-san, happy New Year to you, too.
So anyway, I want to know about these
Pochi Bukuro things, like why they're called that.
Ah, come on.
Why can't you trust your old man just a little bit?
Or at least you could do
your fact-checking when I'm not around.
Alrighty then.
Time for me to log on and give all my gaming buddies
a Happy New Year greeting.
Oh, teach logged on.
Oh.
This is so sad.
It's like the poor woman doesn't have anything better to do.
I mean, she's always online, always!
No wonder she doesn't have a boyfriend.
Lucky Star!
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, luckies!
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
Can you guys say, "time flies"?
'Cause we're on episode 12, baby!
- -Uh...
This ocean is hell.
Okay, so, uh,
Akira-sama was supposed to show up
in today's episode of "Lucky Star,"
but as you can see, she fell ill
at the last minute and couldn't quite make it.
- -Huh?
That's right, it's a nasty cold.
But we had a standy of you there with a sign on it,
so if folks were watching the show,
they'd see something that sort of looked like you.
- -Huh?
Wait, Akira-sama.
- -
Okay, I guess everyone can tell
Akira-sama's wiped out for today.
So how about we wrap this up?
See you guys later! Bye-ni!
Huh, why do you keep saying that?
I am not getting a big head!
- -What?
"I'm gonna make you listen to the full version
of 'Take It! The Sailor Suit'"?
- -"Look forward"-- what?
"If you don't watch the next episode,
I'm going to lecture you in the name of Mars."
Fumoffu.
Way to tear it up, you guys!
That was so much fun!
It was!
No one entered a song.
What's with you? You're next in the lineup.
Why didn't you pick a song yet?
Oh, I couldn't decide.
What song should I pick?
I'll help you look for one.
Oh, I found a menu.
Ooh, I didn't know they served food here.
Mm-hmm. I sang this one already.
Now my flow's off.
Oh, I should've saved it for later.
What do you mean, "flow"?
You know, getting your groove on, your flow?
How you work yourself up to sing a song?
I don't get it.
Ooh, how about this one?
♪ Hey, Godman ♪
♪ Can you hear me? ♪
Look, they also have tambourines.
Yeah, so you can really have some fun.
Here, Miyuki-chan, let's use these.
How fun!
Yes, I'll do this one.
I don't care! Just pick something already!
Here's a song I know
will get everybody moving!
Oh! You know this one!
I know it too!
Well, I know of it.
♪ Makenai... ♪
Oh, I blew it.
- -
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"...
Miyuki here. If you'd like
to describe something as being at the top of its class
or standing head and shoulders above everything else,
you'd use the term "dan-totsu."
Apparently ,this is the abbreviation of "danzen top."
According to record, the very first time this term
was used in print was when you-know-who won the election
to become governor of Tokyo.
And, yes, he did win by a landslide.
Next time, "Delicious Day."
Look forward to it.
Okay, let's do this!
Sure, let's go.
Grrr!
Quit screwin' around and start!
'Kay, time to take your seats, guys.
Happy New Year, everyone.
Here's hopin' you guys all have
a safe and productive New Year.
But then again, some of you will be my responsibility
for only three more months.
I wonder who that could be.
Uh, ma'am, you don't mean me.
I can stay, right?
I believe in that it feels like a New Year thing.
There's definitely something in the air.
Yeah, but then school starts up
and you get into a weird mood.
It kinda sucks.
There's a weird sorta something working its power
over the holiday. You got that right.
'Cause even though I spend my first three days of the year
working my butt off for my family,
I gained weight!
That's the magic of the New Year.
You know, it's harder to burn calories
when it's cold out.
It's not like I was sitting around.
I mean, I was busy doing all my Shrine Maiden stuff.
Bet you were busy eating, too.
Shrine Maiden New Year's food!
Shrine Maiden zoni soup!
Shrine Maiden snacks, snacks, snacks!
Shrine Maiden and snacks!
-Argh! -Yeah!
But then, there's the games you're supposed to play
over New Year's.
You know, stuff like battledore, Hyakunin Isshu,
and kite flying.
But I never saw anybody play that stuff over the holiday.
Well nowadays with all the power lines and traffic,
flying kites can be pretty dangerous.
I was pretty busy for the first three days of the New Year,
but after that, I just read books and watched TV.
Actually, that's what I did over the break.
I played battledore, Hyakunin Isshu and Fortune's Smile.
Wow, I didn't think you'd be into that.
My family tends to be Western in their ways,
but our country relatives are much more traditional.
I wore my kimono to the shrine on New Year's Eve,
and I had a lot of fun playing games with my cousins.
"Even when the gods held sway in the..."
She's way more Japanese than me.
She's more traditional that us!
What is Fortune's Smile?
Hey, are all of the 100 poems in Hyakunin Isshu
waka poems?
Yes, the first verse is read
and then you have to find the card with the second verse.
I bet you're awesome at it.
Oh, no, I'm not as good as some players.
The really good ones can grab the correct card
in a blink of an eye.
Yeah, well, with me,
I sorta prefer playing the kinds of games
that don't make you feel like you're really studying.
You know, your attitude is the reason why the future of Japan
is in the toilet.
I know!
We could have battles with the Hyakunin Isshu cards!
You could summon the power of the monk Semimaru!
Semimaru's Shining Bright Attack
versus Ono-no-komachi's Lovely Attack!
Now that sounds like fun.
Going there again, huh?
If you play the game like that, Kagami,
one that made you move around,
you'd be able to lose some weight.
Shut up, you!
It's those damn rice cakes.
It's true, rice cakes are high in calories.
If you have a piece the size of a matchbox,
it's basically the same calories as a small bowl of rice.
That means each bite you take
is like a super huge bowl of rice!
Hold it!
Don't you eat rice cakes?
Yeah, you know, I grew up without a mom,
so I never really had stuff like zoni soup to eat.
I don't really eat rice cakes all that much anyway.
Wow, you don't know what you're missing!
There a lots of ways to eat rice cakes.
Zoni soup, shiruko soup, soy-flavored mochi.
And it sounds like those rice cakes are gonna
screw up your diet again next year, Kagami.
Ugh!
I hope you don't mind me asking, Izumi-san,
but instead of rice cakes,
what does your family eat for New Year's?
We eat stuff like pizza and pasta.
Oh.
Our family's New Year always begins with fresh pasta!
At the end of every year, my dad goes
and cleans out the pasta machine.
I bet you guys didn't know
that if you don't use it for a while, it gets all rusty.
And if you use it without cleaning it first,
your pasta comes out all black and stuff.
So me and Dad clean it up and then we make some fresh pasta
and bake up some handmade pizza dough.
Ooh, that does sound authentic.
Unlike Kagami's house,
where the pizza's delivered and the pasta's the dried stuff.
Ugh!
Yeah, actually, we don't eat pizza or pasta for New Year's.
No way!
It doesn't work
with a traditional meal.
It does work.
It goes great with roasted chicken!
Is that traditional?
Yeah, it's traditional.
I think that's more Westernized.
No way, really?
So, Miyuki-san, what food did you and your family eat
for New Year's?
You wanna know what we ate?
You're a rich girl,
and your family's more into Western customs.
I can't see you eatin' rice cakes and traditional
New Year's food.
I bet you ate a full course of French cuisine
on New Year's Day.
Oh, well that's not exactly true.
I did eat traditional Japanese food on New Year's.
In fact, when I took a bite of rice cake,
I couldn't bite through and it stretched way out!
She's a walking Shrine de Moe!
Rice cakes are stretchy.
I can't believe how fast the New Year's vacation goes by.
I know, Winter vacation
ends too fast.
Sure, it looks long on paper,
but after doing the big house cleaning,
writing all those New Year's cards, and doing homework,
it doesn't leave you with a whole lot of relaxing time.
Whoa! I didn't get a New Year's card from you
and you copied my homework yesterday!
Uguu...
Did you have your first dream of the year, Kona-chan?
Huh, oh, right.
You're supposed to have good luck if you dream
of certain things.
Mmm-hmm, yup.
Yeah, usually they say it's one, Mt. Fuji; two, hawk;
and three, eggplant.
I heard that they've extended the items on that list
to four, a fan; five, tobacco; and six, a blind musician.
Wow, the list
goes up to six now!
Yeah, you know,
does anybody really dream about that stuff?
I mean tobacco, eggplant, a blind musician?
Tell me about it.
Do you have to see all those things in the same dream
or something?
I suppose if you saw them all in one dream
you'd have tremendous good fortune.
However, you only need to see one.
Oh, I thought you needed to see something
like two hawks or three eggplants in a dream.
Hate to be the one to say this,
but I don't remember most of my dreams.
I think people who obsess over stuff like that
are having way too much fun with the whole New Year's thing.
That's true.
In my first dream of the year,
when I opened my shoe locker, my shoes were missing!
Imagine, but someone else's shoes were there,
and since I needed to go home, I tried to put them on.
Unfortunately, the shoes were the wrong size.
Hmm.
Later, I looked up the meaning of my dream
in the dictionary of dreams and fortune telling.
A dream is a subliminal message,
and according to the dictionary, I'm seeking social skills.
And it will be a long time before I can attain them.
Apparently, whenever you see shoes in dreams,
it's supposed to mean social status.
Shoes are social?
Uh-huh.
So you're ambitious, Miyuki-san.
I kinda get it, but sorta don't.
Heh-heh.
Did you guys hear what happened
at this year's Coming of Age Ceremony?
A bunch of people rushed the stage
and started causing trouble.
Don't they have any shame?
I mean, they're supposed to be representing Japan.
Why bother going if you're just gonna get kicked off?
That's what I'm saying.
The Coming of Age Ceremony's so boring.
I don't wanna go, do you?
She's on her way to becoming
a good-for-nothing adult.
So what are you guys gonna wear
to the Coming of Age Ceremony?
Hmm, since it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,
I'd wear a long sleeve kimono.
Now that you brought it up, what about you?
Yeah, well, knowin' my dad,
he's gonna want me to wear a long sleeve kimono.
He totally would, wouldn't he?
Although, if you wore one, you'd look like a kid
celebrating your seven-five-three!
Guh.
Happy New Year, and hope it's a good one!
Happy New Year to you too, Onee-san.
You haven't come by in a while.
Well, with my hubby coming home,
and all the New Year's stuff that needed doing,
and my little sis caught a fever too, so...
Yeah, she's frail, isn't she?
I mean, that's not an excuse!
I wasn't trying to weasel my way out
of giving you all you New Year's cash or anything, really!
I didn't even ask,
and she blows her cover.
Rookie move, officer.
In other sports news today,
there was a Hyakunin Isshu tournament,
and it was an awesome turnout.
Oh, that reminds me!
When you were a little kid,
do you remember what kind of stuff
you did on New Year's Day?
Hmm? On New Year's?
Let's see, I'm pretty sure I did something, I think.
Yeah, like, um...
Dot, dot, dot, dot.
Sorry, brain fart!
I totally forgot.
Man, she lives in
her own little world.
I don't think I'll ever have a normal conversation with her.
I blasted all the memories behind me!
Lucky Star!
You know, Tsukasa's been holed up
under the kotatsu lately.
It's been cold though.
I know.
The kotatsu's awesome,
but when you're under it,
getting up to go to the bathroom's a drag.
Yeah, right?
But you don't have to say it out loud like that.
My dad's got
a killer line he whips out
whenever I've been sittin' under it for too long.
Really, what does he say?
Hey, Konata, if you're gonna live
under that kotatsu all day long, I'm puttin' it away.
Ugh!
So he doesn't mind
not having it out?
No, he loves it!
He just wants to teach me a lesson is all.
If we've been sittin' under it for a while
we both fall asleep.
Oh, I know!
But I heard that if you fall asleep like that,
you'll catch a cold.
Yep.
If I catch us sleeping, I always try to turn it off.
Yeah, those kotatsus are like a mixture of heaven and hell.
Uh, how?
Because right before it goes on,
and after you've turned it off,
it feels even colder than ever.
Mm-hmm, you're right, it does, doesn't it?
Isn't it hard to get out of bed when it's this cold?
Yeah, oh,
and when you take a bath
and that time it takes you to get undressed
and jump in the tub's awful!
Makes you think twice about runnin' bare naked.
Yeah, 'cause it's slippery.
Oh, and when it's late and you need to go to the bathroom,
don't you hate that?
Yeah, brr!
Come on, guys. We gotta get off.
When you get off the bus
till you get into class is hell, too.
Yeah.
It's almost Valentine's Day.
It gets more exciting around this time of year, doesn't it?
It's funny how everyone walks around
acting like Valentine's is no big deal,
but secretly, they're all anxious about it.
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to have someone special on that day?
Someone to share your feelings with?
I think that would be the best thing ever.
Ah, Tsukasa, you're a hopeless romantic,
and I won't say it's a conspiracy
invented by the candy industry.
Now that you mention it,
this time of year's special for someone like me, too.
Why?
'Cause the leftover chocolates always go on sale afterwards
so I can buy a lot for cheap to make my own.
You really have no dreams at all, do you now?
They say, "Money can't buy you love,"
but when you think about it, Valentine's Day chocolates
are a way to show your love and you buy it with money.
That's a cold observation,
considering the only romance you've had has been in games.
Yeah, well in games, the whole idea's
to get your relationship level up.
That's way more important than the actual day.
Okay.
Yeah, well Valentine's Day's just another day to me.
It's only an excuse for the boys to get all weird.
Guess no one triggered the Kagami flag again this year.
Oh yeah? You got anything goin' on?
All kinds of people love me.
In your game, yeah, we got it.
You know, I worry about you with all your talk
of relationship levels and flags and stuff.
Don't you feel like you're sort of missing out
if all you do is limit yourself to the world in your games?
Ugh.
I really hate it when people talk about stuff
they don't know anything about.
Huh.
You saying I'm wrong?
In game time, events happen pretty fast,
so when you're playing and you come across Valentine's Day,
it's usually over before you know it.
So what?
This year's Valentine's Day is different.
I wanna give some chocolate to someone.
You're kidding, really?
Mm-hmm.
It's someone who's playing the same online game as me.
One of your gaming buddies?
Mm-hmm.
You're gonna hand it to him in person?
Uh-uh, we're not gonna be seeing each other
in person-person.
Huh?
It's all gonna happen in game.
I mean, we're both human behind our characters,
so what's the difference?
But does that even count?
In the end, it's just a character in a game.
Hey, don't insult my wife like that!
Huh, wife?
Mmm.
In the game, I play a male character
and I'm married to her.
Uh.
Whoa, in the game the guy's giving the girl chocolate.
But you're really a girl, so that means
you'll be giving another girl chocolate?
'Cause the other person's a girl, right?
On the contrary, my wife's a guy in real life.
Huh?
Oh, whatever.
As long as everyone's cool and having fun, it's all good.
That's right!
I think I wanna go overseas.
Wow, that came outta nowhere, didn't it?
Well, yesterday, Miyuki-san told me...
Women giving chocolates to men on February the 14th
is a tradition that's exclusive only to Japan.
In Western countries,
people give candies and cards to friends and loved ones
regardless of their gender.
Really?
That's exactly what she said,
so that means that even a girl like me could give
a whole bunch of candy!
That's one way of looking at it,
provided you're as popular as you think
and not just overconfident.
Oh, it's okay, 'cause in other countries,
small girls--
Wow, stop!
Let's keep it G-rated, okay?
Uh, you're rad!
Happy Valentine's Day, Kona-chan.
This is for you!
Wow, awesome wrapping, for a uniform,
and the inside's all heart-shaped and everything!
I put a lot of work into it.
Uh, Tsukasa gets pretty elaborate with stuff like that.
She was up all night making those,
and they're only friendship chocolates.
Even if these are
friendship chocolates, don't give them out to boys.
They'll get the wrong idea.
Huh, what?
Huh?
For you, enjoy.
Kagami, you're giving me chocolate?
I only made 'em 'cause she was making some, too.
Don't be such as spaz.
Oh.
The fact that you worked so hard on making this,
even though you suck at cooking,
totally turns me on, Kagami.
Did you know that?
Oh, shut up and put it away!
Huh?
Kagami?
Here, I made this for you.
Don't get the wrong idea.
It's friendship chocolate.
Friendship, got it?
I'm sorry if they look all weird and everything.
Don't be a fool.
I don't care if they look funny.
The important thing's that you made it for me, Kagami.
Whoa, don't be stupid.
It's nothing like that.
Really, it isn't.
Is that what's goin' on?
No, so shut up and put it away.
It's my first time.
First time's the best.
Hey, Miyuki-san, did you give chocolate to anyone?
I gave some to my father and also to a male relative.
And I gave chocolates to pretty much everybody
who's friendly to me.
And I gave some to you, Tsukasa, and Miyuki.
Come on, did everyone have
the boringest Valentine's Day, or what?
You live in an online game, so zip it.
You said your cousin was applying to Ryoo.
What happened with that?
She got accepted.
And since she lives far away, she's gonna stay at my place
starting next month.
She's always been like a little sister,
and we've been talkin' a lot about her moving in.
That's awesome!
But compared to you, isn't it gonna be hard
to tell which of you is the little sister?
You don't get it.
When I say she's little, she's little, like way little.
She's that small?
That fact she got accepted without any hitches
must mean she's super smart.
Well, someone's sounding confident today.
The school accepted you, didn't it?
Yeah, but I barely made it.
It still counts though.
I just remembered-- we have to take
our college entrance exams next year.
Oh brother, we're gonna be studying forever.
That's gonna be nasty.
Oh no.
Should I take the exams?
I don't have any plans for the future.
You really need to start thinking about your future.
Hmm, "academic" and "labor" are words
that just don't exist in my vocabulary.
I wonder what someone like her
could do for a living.
She could design games, 'cause that's her hobby, anyway.
She could make her own manga and sell it at Comiket.
She's naturally curious, so she could be a reporter.
No, maybe she becomes a writer
who writes for a specific genre.
She's good with computers, maybe a web designer?
Or a screen writer, who writes about random things
that don't have a plot?
Or she goes to college.
Or, maybe it's all the same damn thing!
What?
Hmm.
Hmpf!
What's up?
She's here.
Boss, it's really her, the Legendary Girl!
Ay!
What?
We let her get away from us last time.
-Boss! -Boss!
Boss!
But not today!
We'll do everything in our power to make sure
that the the Legendary Girl A gets to the cash register!
Hmm.
Giro, she's having a hard time deciding.
Hahaha!
Then it's up to us
to make her purchasing decisions for her!
All right, people, you ready?
Yeah!
Say what? Yeah!
Say what? Yeah!
Say what?
Yeah, you know it!
Hmm.
I have a visual, boss.
I'm gonna try to figure out what the Legendary Girl A
is looking for.
I'm counting on you.
What's the newest manga?
It's Sergeant Frog, volume 14, sir!
Perfect!
Make sure you display them
in the Legendary Girl A's line of sight!
Deploy the flyers!
Tama!
Locked and loaded, sir!
Good.
Keep an eye on her movements.
Make sure our best sellers are flanking the Legendary Girl A
as she approaches the register!
Roger!
Sir!
Eh.
Ugh!
The Legendary Girl A is not looking for a manga,
repeat, not looking for manga!
What?
Boss, she's headed for the DVD section.
Fantastic!
I want blockades up on both sides of the aisle.
We're gonna funnel the Legendary Girl A
straight into the new releases.
Roger!
Sir!
Oops, sorry, am I in your way?
Tama, tama?
Oh, I'm so very sorry!
That a girl.
Ugh!
Boss!
Finally, we got her!
She's gonna buy something!
I did it! I won! I beat her!
We're gonna party like rock stars tonight, you hear me?
-Woohoo! -Woohoo, Sir!
Huh.
She faked us out!
Agh!
Oh!
Ugh, this calls for my secret weapon.
Bring me that ultra rare, out-of-print,
bargain bin DVD, girl.
Boss, she's headed straight for you.
Yes, that's it.
This is so beautiful, I never want this scene to end.
The entire U.S. of A inside me is all cheering
and applauding!
Yay for us!
Yay, sir!
1,785 yen, please.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Darn it, I'm short three yen.
Oh well.
Could you guys put it back for me?
Thanks.
Foiled again!
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hiya, Luckies!
All righty, let's get this thing movin' already!
I can't believe Lucky Channel's on its 13th episode.
Isn't that amazing?
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami,
but you guys knew that already, didn't you?
I bet you did, a-ha!
Nice to see you again!
I'm Minoru Shiraishi, Akira-sama's faithful assistant.
Isn't this great?
We're on our 13th episode, and that means
we're in our second season.
In fact, getting this far is a lot like
reaching the halfway station on Mt. Fuji,
isn't that right, Akira-sama?
Huh?
You can get to the halfway station by car, you idiot.
Well, of course you can, I was just saying.
Oh, that's right.
This one time, I climbed to the top of Mt. Takao--
What are you, blind?
Aren't you gonna say anything?
-Right. I though of... -D-d-d-d-d-d-d-drills!
Oh my, Akira-sama, those twin drills you're sporting
are really cool!
What's so cool about 'em, slack jaw?
Well, they're all wound up like a couple of seashells?
Huh?
-Oh, my god. -D-d-drill.
Oh, that's right!
Today we're announcing the results
of our very own Lucky Star Action Figure Project!
Akira-sama, if you'd be so kind as to announce the winner.
Konata Izumi gets her very own action figure--
Akira-sama, read it properly!
Congratulations, woohoo!
Ugh!
Was there any doubt she'd win?
This thing was rigged from the beginning,
so basically the radio show
and the LC aren't important, is that it?
Oh, sure, it's all about the main segment.
You got it all wrong. We're important, aren't we?
Mmm-hmm.
You see, the producer says we're important!
There it is!
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever, I'm used to getting
bent over all the time anyways.
I don't really care anymore.
Bent over is not a very nice way of putting it.
Yeah, bet you're all torn up about it.
And next, you're gonna tell me that they made
an action figure out of you, isn't that right?
No, of course not, God forbid!
Any crap, Konata Izumi gets her very own action figure,
and as a booby prize, Minoru Shiraishi gets one, too.
You've gotta be freaking kidding!
Ugh! Not good.
Oh, it looks like our time's up for today.
Keep sending us your comments, questions,
and any good things you might have to say about the show.
You can use our homepage if you want
or you can send your letters the old-fashioned way.
Right, Akira-sama?
I'm going.
Whoa, wait a second!
Bye-ni!
Akira-sama, wait up!
Okay people, listen up.
D-drill!
On the next episode
of Sergeant Frog...
No!
Say, "On the next episode of Lucky Star!"
Giro, Giro.
Sir, I just thought of something awesome.
Did you know that anime is a global industry?
We could use it to brainwash the Pekoponians
and complete our invasion of Pekopon in no time!
Oh, Sarge, you're so smart!
Ha, pathetic.
Why don't you act like a soldier
and crush them with brute force?
Shut up, you red daruma!
Ugh?
These days,
the one with the information
wins the war, but seeing as how you're so old,
you probably don't get it.
Watch your mouth, damn you!
Yeah, whatever.
Next time, under one roof!
Look forward to it!
Gi-Giro!
Okay, let's do this.
Sure, let's go.
Grrr!
Quit screwin' around and start!
Yutaka! Come on, we gotta get going.
Upsy daisy.
Okay, sis.
Get ready for the first day of your new life.
Let's rock, man!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Attention, everyone!
I'm here to announce that Yutaka got accepted!
Woohoo! Bring her in already.
Come on, Yutaka.
Well, I just wanted to say thank you
for letting me stay with you.
And I promise I won't be any trouble.
Just go ahead and make yourself at home here, okay?
Oh, thanks.
By the way, congrats on getting accepted.
Oh, thank you!
Man, I'm so glad you got accepted.
You'll get to hang out with that handkerchief...
I'm a winner.
I'm living the dream.
Are you all right?
Oh!
Do you want me to take you to the nurse's office?
She actually talked to me.
And then she let me borrow her handkerchief.
It makes me all happy
'cause I'm gonna have a best friend now.
That's really cool and all,
but what if she doesn't get accepted?
Uhh...
No! People like her always get accepted! Always!
I know how you feel. It's just that--
And she's probably really smart, too!
I didn't say she wasn't.
Thanks for clearing that up, though.
Hang on.
Yu-chan, what would you have done
if you didn't get accepted?
Oh, I know, I know. Don't remind me.
Don't sweat it, Yu-chan. I'm sure you're gonna be okay.
You're right!
I'll see her again on the day they announce
the names of the people who got accepted.
Yeah, maybe.
I still have to return the handkerchief to her.
'Scuse me!
Here. I'm really glad to see you again.
And I've been wanting to give this back to you.
You wanna give it back?
Yes.
Sorry. I didn't wanna trouble you.
I gave it to you thinking that you would keep it.
To be honest, I really didn't think
I'd ever see you again.
You didn't think I'd be accepted here, did you?
No.
I see.
Now I get it. You must be in the same grade as I am.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
It's okay. I guess you thought I was someone's kid sister.
My family's picking me up today, so--
Oh, okay.
Well, goodbye, then.
Um, I hope that the next three years
are gonna be awesome for us.
I'm so lucky.
I haven't even started high school,
and I've already got a good friend.
Oh, I forgot to ask her name.
When you see her again,
make sure you ask for her name.
-Mmm. -Mmm.
How are you feeling? Are you sick or something?
Oh, yeah. It was the ride over. I got a little carsick.
I did take some medicine, though.
Don't worry. I'll be okay in a bit.
Yutaka's such a frail and delicate little girl, ain't she?
Wait. Sure she is, but seriously.
Do you have any idea what your driving's like, Onee-san?
I mean even I got a little...
I wonder if I'm gonna get along
with all my new classmates at Ryouou High.
I mean, I'm the only one
out of my old school that made it in,
and if I get sick real easy like today--
Don't worry, Yutaka. You're a good girl. You'll be fine.
Grr. Stop treating me like a little kid!
Hm...
Thinking...
Converting...
If you and Miyuki-san teamed up, that would be
the most awesomest thing in the history of everything.
Huh?
That's right. I'm living in Konata Onee-chan's house now.
Oh. Oh!
Good morning, Onee-chan.
Why you up so early on a holiday?
Oh. Actually I was about to jump into bed.
So I guess it's good night.
I was up playing games all n--
This place is way different than my house!
You know how we've got
college entrance exams coming up next year?
We've been getting all these calls
from cram schools and telemarketers selling textbooks.
Man, they're so annoying.
However, if you have caller ID on your phone,
you can tell right away
if someone like that is calling you.
On the display, the number shows up as restricted.
I'm home!
Caller ID, huh?
Hello, Mother. I'm home.
Oh, you can't be serious.
I can't imagine how much trouble that must've been.
Oh no, it's the same way in our family. Absolutely.
I'm sorry to cut you off, but my daughter's just come home.
Yes, yes, we'll talk again soon.
All right then, have a wonderful day.
You are you talking to?
It sounded like a lively conversation.
Oh, that was just a telemarketer.
Mother, I'm sorry, but didn't you see
it was a telemarketer when they were calling?
Yes, but I was bored.
So I decided to have a conversation anyway.
And we ended up talking for more than an hour.
Okay, the total comes to--
What was that about winning the National Championship?
Tsukasa, the world's a war zone!
You can never show mercy, ever!
The other day, I saw this thing
I wanted to get with my reward points.
So I thought, "Do I go offense and get it
or defense and save my points?" So I got it!
But now there's a new thing that just came out
and I wanna get it before anyone else!
It's that one over there, but I don't have enough points!
What'll I do? What'll I do?
Someone sure enjoys their life, don't they?
Um, you gonna pay?
Okay, where would y'all like to sit?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Uh, yeah, since we're a little on the underage side,
maybe we'll go with non-smoking.
Come this way, please.
Um, I gotta go to the bathroom first.
Okay.
Oh, hey, Tsukasa, we're over here. Over here!
Took you long enough.
I know. Sorry.
I have to say this, 'cause I think about it a lot.
But you know when you go to a restaurant
and need to use the bathroom?
How come it's always by the smoking section?
Yeah, right?
Especially since we went
out of our way to get non-smoking.
Seriously, though, I wonder why they have it like that.
Well, if someone starts a fire, they got a place close by
where they can get their hands on some water.
They can fill up buckets there and hook up a hose.
Oh, I didn't know they had a hose back there.
Of course they do. You didn't know they had a hose?
Hah! That's right.
Someone's never worked a single day out in the real world.
No, she hasn't.
-Nope. Not at all. -Okay, shut up.
Or one covers the stink of the other, maybe?
We're gonna eat, so stop talking about toilets and stinks.
It's kinda gross, okay?
And in other news, a number of incidents
have occurred recently,
where girls on their way to elementary school
have been approached from behind and harassed by a stranger.
We're starting to see a lot of stuff like that
happening to kids lately.
You better be careful when you go out, Yu-chan.
Yeah, I will.
Unacceptable!
But I can understand how he's probably feeling.
You understand him?
They talk about this guy on the news every day,
making a big deal out of him.
It's amazing to think that there's someone out there
harassing little girls like that.
And if I had the chance, I'd tell him,
"Aren't you jealous of me?"
I'm a little worried about your thinking, Dad.
Just please don't do anything
that Yui-neisan can arrest you for, okay?
Huh?
Lucky Star!
Is anybody home?
Yes!
Yoohoo! Hello!
Come on in.
Where's Kagami? What's she up to?
Oh, she's hanging out
with a couple of her friends from class.
Oh, yeah?
It's just, I don't know.
It feels like something's missing, and it's frustrating.
Maybe 'cause you miss her.
Man, is it me, or has it gotten super-warm out lately?
Yeah, it has.
Isn't it peaceful now that we're on spring break
and don't have any homework to do?
Yeah, it is.
Yes, it is.
And I think that line's reserved
for those who actually do their homework,
as opposed to copying it.
Don't get in any strange places.
That's impossible!
So, when you're playing robot games like this,
do you really know who all the characters are and stuff?
Yeah. I guess you could say I do.
Hmm. Really?
'Cause I remember you said that your taste
in anime and manga was all because of your dad.
Yup.
Oh, yeah?
So when you were younger, did you have a hard time
keeping up with the girls
when they started talking girl stuff?
Hmm? I didn't have a hard time keeping up with anything.
I got to see way more
of that kinda stuff than they ever did.
Oh. Uh, yeah.
Okay.
Is that your final answer?
That's my final answer!
Man, that big ol' pause he takes kills me every time.
And his face is so big, it's scary.
Oh, it looks like
the show's about to end.
I guess she got the question wrong.
Oh, come on!
You're guessing if they got the question right
by looking at how much time
the show's got left before the commercial.
Yeah, but I can't stand the suspense of not knowing.
They drag it out too long.
But the show's all about enjoying that part of it.
Yup, that's our Tsukasa.
Hey, you!
Hey, you, too. Well, here she is.
My cousin, Yu-chan. Go on, say hi.
It's nice to meet you. I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
And these are my best friends, Kagami and Tsukasa.
Yeah, I know.
You're the ones Onee-chan always talks about.
Oh? What kinda stuff has she been saying about us?
Uh...
What in the hell have you been telling this girl?
The way she looked just now, I wonder.
See? You see? What'd I tell ya?
So, did you already have your graduation ceremony?
Oh, yes. The other day.
Wow. Graduation. What memories, huh, guys?
I don't really remember my graduation ceremony.
So did you get a button
from any of the guys in your class, Yutaka-chan?
Oh no. I didn't.
At my old junior high, our uniform was a blazer.
That's right.
I guess a lot of schools are like that these days.
Although, maybe it's because there's not a whole lot
of that "getting something from your crush"
stuff going on anymore.
You really think so?
It sounds kinda sad, but I guess I never did it myself.
Every now and then, I'll read a blog
where someone's talking about that stuff,
so it's sorta still going on.
Wait a minute.
It's all about getting something
from someone you like, right?
Isn't that the whole point of doing it?
But then you totally out yourself as having
a crush on the guy when you go get the button.
Why don't you ask the guy out
and get the whole guy instead of just a button?
Ideally, yeah.
I guess that's what you'd wanna have happen.
So, Yutaka-chan, did you have someone
that you had a crush on or something?
Oh, not me.
I'd have to stay home a lot 'cause I felt sick.
Even when I went to class, I'd start feeling ill.
I think I kinda made everyone around me depressed.
And there's the fact that I'm really short and frail
and I kinda look like a little kid.
Everyone was always making fun of me.
Why would anybody fall in love with me, you know?
You'll be fine, Yu-chan.
There's definitely a need for girls like you
as long as you aren't picky.
Huh? Picky?
Pocky. Hey, Yu-chan, can I take a look at your yearbook?
Me, too. I wanna see your yearbook.
Well, it's a little embarrassing.
There's not a lot of pictures of me or anything.
Hmm.
So what class were you in again?
Wait a second!
Were you checking the absentee list for my name just now?
You were, weren't you?
Oh, was I being that obvious?
Hmm!
You wanna know the difference
between junior high and high school?
-Mm-hmm. -I know.
For one thing, they don't make you join
an extracurricular club.
I don't know. Doesn't that depend on the school?
Well, one difference is that we're a prep school,
so our curriculum's bigger and faster-paced
than the one you had in junior high.
And I guess you'll need more stamina than in junior high
'cause the commute to school's really long.
One difference I've noticed
is that from elementary school through high school,
the time you spend sleeping at your desk
gets longer and longer.
Especially during hard classes.
Yeah, that's totally true!
Like when you start drifting off
'cause the teacher's talking--
No matter what you do, do not end up like them, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Yu-chan,
I see you kept your old junior high uniform.
Yeah, I thought maybe I could wear it
as my street clothes without anyone noticing.
It looks plain enough, don't you think?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Kagami. What'd you guys do with your uniforms?
Oh, we gave ours to a couple
of younger girls in our neighborhood.
What about you?
What about me?
You probably couldn't find anyone
tiny enough to give it to.
Two things, Kagami: you're rude and shut up.
Anyway, I did what Yu-chan did.
I kept mine for cosplay purposes.
C-cos?
Yeah, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad.
Like, really bad.
It's just cosplay, man.
Talking about it sure brings back memories.
Sometimes I think it'd be cool
to go back to my elementary school and junior high,
see my old teachers and say hi and stuff.
But there's been all this stuff
about people trespassing at schools.
If you went back, chances are
you'd get funny looks from everyone.
Yeah, and if you went back, you'd fit right in.
It'd be like you never left.
I'm pretty sure you weren't trying
to compliment me there, were you?
Our vacation went by fast this time, didn't it?
I hear that.
It's like before you know it,
school's about to start all over again.
And now that spring's here,
we've got all those physical exams and fitness tests.
Oh man, what a pain.
But you're lucky, Kona-chan.
Your motor nerves are so good.
Hey, Tsukasa,
which nerves are supposed to be the motor nerves anyway?
Hello, everybody! How's it going?
Sorry I'm late. And congrats on the graduating, Yutaka.
Hey, neisan. Come on in.
'Cause we're celebrating a graduation,
how about we all go out drinking together?
It's my treat. Uncle Sojiro's going.
Woah!
Excuse me, Officer?
We're underage.
Onee-chan, I don't think
they'll even let us through the door.
You should know better than that.
They won't notice if you walk in
like you're supposed to be there.
When I was a student, I did it all the time,
and I never got caught, man. Not even once.
Uh-uh.
Your two little relatives would totally blow our cover.
Hm, really?
You'll live.
I was thinking it might be nice
if we all went out to the amusement park or something.
It's still vacation.
Ohh.
Um, that sounds like fun and everything,
but you don't have to.
I don't wanna be a burden.
I'd feel bad if you go to all that trouble for me.
Besides, I went there on a field trip
with my class the other day.
Hey!
I just remembered I went there
on field trip with my class, too.
How about it, though? Were you okay there?
Mm-hmm. I didn't get sick the whole time I was there.
And I got to hang out with my friends.
No, I mean were you okay
with the height restrictions on the rides?
What are you talking about? I was fine.
I'm in high school now, okay?
You know, I was watching
a school drama show and I got to thinking.
Junior high and high school
are totally different, aren't they?
Huh? Well, yeah.
And I heard that the lunches
aren't given out like in junior high.
Yeah, I guess not.
Either you bring your own lunch
or you gotta buy one in the cafeteria.
Or you could buy lunch and bring it.
Do you make a lunch
to take to school every day, Onee-chan?
Well, yeah, sure.
Wow!
You're cool!
Uh-oh, this isn't good.
She's really good at games.
She can communicate all kinds of ways.
And she cooks and does chores!
So yeah, I think I'm getting an idea
of the pressure you feel as an older sister.
When she looks at me with those big eyes,
I feel like I gotta do my best, you know?
Huh?
Yui-neisan drives like a maniac.
Aha! What's up? How ya doing?
Yui-neisan gets drunk
and crashes at our place.
Homework, huh?
Eh, as long as you keep it vague,
put down whatever you want.
Yui-neisan says
irresponsible things.
But then again I wonder if it depends on the person.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Lucky Star.
My final answer is my ass, buddy.
I am not doing this anymore. Uh-uh...
And she's mad again.
...and when I watch the damn thing, where'd I go?
Should I do it? I'm gonna do it.
Aw yeah, I'm gonna do it.
Uh, Akira-sama, you forgot to call out the title. The title.
Huh?
Uh, please call out the title, please?
- -Tiny eyes.
Hiya, luckies.
Like any of it matters. What a friggin' crock.
Right now, I am so disgusted, man.
All I get's a voice cameo? Me. Just my voice.
Whoopdie-doodle-doo!
Well, they didn't give me any screen time, either--
Who cares? I wasn't talking about you!
Windy.
Well, Sunshine, did anyone ask about you just now? Huh?
At any time during the conversation,
was your flippin' name ever brought up?
Uh, no, I guess nobody said anything about me.
Then why the hell are you butting in like that?
You just come sliding out with your big fat head.
What are you, stupid or something?
Always cutting me off with your me-me-me thing.
Looks like someone's self-centered, eh, Shiraishi?
Ugh, this thing is leaving a film in my mouth.
Listen up, Peaches, the problem
is that I, Akira Kogami, was not shown
on screen in the main segment.
I know!
Let me ask you something. I'm an idol, right? I am.
Well, an idol's face is their number-one asset.
It needs to be on screen, or am I wrong?
Yes! I mean, no! I mean, you're absolutely right!
Huh? I did not hear you.
Ah! What the staff did to you
was completely inexcusable and unprofessional.
May I ask what you're writing over there?
Okay, guys! Akira needs your help!
I need all your support so that I, Akira Kogami,
can show up in the main segment of the show.
So make sure you send in wads of requests for it.
What?
I don't care how you get the message out there.
Just push hard for me, okay?
I really want you guys to see how good an actor I am.
I really, really want it!
-Really, really? -And, just between us,
Compared to my charms, the other cast members got nothing.
It's really too sad. Yup.
It's sort of like if you compared
an Oscar-winning Hollywood actress...
She's getting desperate.
Really desperate.
Hee-hee. My acting's on a higher level!
It's pretty. It's gorgeous. You'll wanna see more!
So here's your chance to do something good.
Write a letter or leave a comment on the site.
Your voices will count for something.
All your wishes will come true...
Something wrong?
...if you guys can get me an on-camera role in Lucky Star!
What? Stop her? Really?
Um, hey, Akira-sama--
Shut the hell up!
What's with all the chitchat when my career's at stake?
How many times I gotta tell you?
When I'm talking, you better shut your stupid--
You're kidding!
Aw, I was just getting to the part
where I tell you how fabulous I am.
Or maybe I could show you guys just how awesome I am
in the main segment of the next episode.
Just kidding!
Yeah. We'll see you all in the next episode.
-Bye! -
That was so freaking painful.
Go get me the producer. Chop chop!
What, who, me?
You awake?
This is supposed to be a revised script, yeah?
So what in the hell is the title of our segment?
Huh? Well, it's Lucky Channel.
Yeah, script says
Lucky Paradise.
-Well, I-- -Shut up!
And another thing--
they've got some nerve treating me like that.
"Hi, I'm a producer. I worked on a show that was a hit
so that means I can be a total--"
No, what are you saying, stop!
You can't talk to him like that!
On the next episode
of Lucky Star...
I'm Minami Iwasaki.
And I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
I guess they want the two of us
to introduce the next episode, right?
But, do you know what it's about?
No. I'm sorry, I don't.
What, really?
Oh, that's not good.
I don't know anything about it, either.
Oh, well. Guess I'll just wrap it up.
Next time, "I Can't Suddenly Change."
I hope no one minds we didn't say anything.
Look forward to it.
Senior year, Class B...
Ms. Kuroi!
Yeah, yeah.
Do any of you know what the heck this line's for?
Yuki Chan, do you know?
No, I don't.
Well, guys.
I should have known.
And before you get your hopes up, I didn't win either.
It seems I've won.
I did too.
You're the best friends I ever had.
What about me?
Oh, man, I can't see anything.
Come on.
Ohh.
That was amazing!
I was so impressed.
Did you guys see the emcee,
I thought he was super cute.
Uh, you're kidding.
You didn't think so?
Not really my type.
Are you feeling okay, Konata?
You're awfully quiet.
Huh? Uh-huh.
I guess the concert really took it out of you didn't it?
I mean, it was pretty impressive
and I'm even feeling drained.
Uh-huh, I wonder what this feeling I'm feeling is.
-What are you doing? -Huh?
Come on, let's go.
You pick the weirdest things to get all proactive about.
It's the last day to see the cherry blossoms blooming,
I don't want to miss it.
Besides, when you put it off for the next day
or the day after, something always happens.
It'll rain and all the petals will start falling off.
Hey, what happened to that goldfish
you caught at the summer festival last year?
Hmm, actually, I sort of gave him too much food
and now he's, like, this big.
That's big like a shogun!
I guess I pamper the little guy too much.
Wait a minute.
Are you sure you're feeding it the right food?
'Cause that thing is definitely not a goldfish anymore.
Maybe he's fat because he's living
a happy peaceful life, you know?
So are you gonna eat him?
What are you saying?
That reminds me of this anime with pets
who die and return human.
They go back to their owners and they're all,
"welcome home, master"
Here you go with another hardcore reference.
Maybe I should put him on a little diet.
Kagami...
You're not gonna replace him with a skinnier one, are you?
What?
It's getting pretty cold, isn't it?
I guess we'll head home.
It kind of sucks when you're out to see the
cherry blossoms at night, but you're not dressed for it.
Your butt gets so cold while you're sitting down too.
I heard somewhere the average temperature in March
is basically the same as December's.
And April's average temperature is similar to November's.
Wow, if this was November or December,
I'd be piling on the layers.
Yeah, and in March and April,
you never seem to have enough layers on.
Maybe it's 'cause you get tired
of wearing your winter clothes.
Perhaps it's how one subconsciously
expresses their desire for spring to arrive.
Hey, Kagami, doesn't look like she's cold.
Huh?
So she must have come prepared wearing wool undies, huh?
I am not!
Ah, sorry, Keopie, that's all you get today.
If this thing comes back to me as an aggressive boyfriend,
I am so gonna be hating my life.
I wonder what's wrong with her.
Man, my nose hurts.
My skin's so delicate,
it's gotten raw from all this blowing.
This time of year always does this to me, it's relentless.
That sucks, Dad.
I guess I'm always home anyway.
Don't worry, I heard there's lots of stuff
you can buy now that helps with hay fever and allergies.
Oh, really?
Transformation.
This rocks!
And it's cutting out like 99% of the pollen.
Now you're as suspicious on the outside
as you are on the inside.
Please, Dad, don't let the police catch you like that.
Well, I'm off to the store now.
Okay, have fun, Dad.
You wanna go?
Nah, no, thanks.
Hold it, Dad, you're not going out there like that, are you?
Why not? That's why I got my gear on, I'll be okay.
On to our next story.
Around 11:00 last night, a woman barged
into a convenience store and attempted
to walk out with the day's earnings.
-Hey, Yu-chan. -Uh-huh?
I was thinking that maybe all these convenience store
robbers are really just pretending to have allergies.
Huh, yeah, I guess you're right.
-Freeze! -Why me?
-Whoa. -What, tomorrow?
Yeah, let's go, we haven't done that in a while.
And I finished all of my homework by myself.
Huh, did you say by yourself?
No way, you're kidding right, you really did?
Nope, I lied.
Come on, it's April Fools, did you forget?
Didn't you tell a lie today? That's what it's about.
I guess you're not gonna do your homework by yourself.
You must be so bored,
calling me up at this hour just to April Fools me.
Whatever, Slackenstein, I'll see you tomorrow.
Izumi residence.
Oh, hiya, this is Kuroi.
Oh, hi, ma'am.
Oh, hey, it's me, so that game you let me borrow,
I sort of accidentally saved over your data.
What?
I got you.
I so got you, you totally fell for it.
April Fools!
She must be so bored calling this late.
Uh, ma'am...
Yeah, what's up?
The other day Miyuki-san said...
Come now, being a teacher is such
an easy job, I mean if Mrs. Kuroi can do it.
That's what she said.
That brat, so that nice crap's all an act, huh?
Um, ma'am, April Fools.
So basically Konata called
just to April Fools me, unbelievable.
You have a chance to trick anyone with a lie today?
Uh, yeah, I did.
No way, you did?
What was the lie you told?
Uh, what I said just now.
I lied when I said I lied.
You what? Wait,
you don't have to force yourself to tell a lie today, you know?
So, what kind of lie did Kona-chan tell?
Mmm, she said she finished her homework all by herself,
and I was pretty dumb to fall for it too.
Everyone knows that'll never happen.
If she was lying, it means she hasn't finished her homework.
Knowing her, I'm positive she hasn't finished it.
Oh, okay.
You're just glad someone's
in the same boat as you, aren't you?
Uh, well I--
Hmm?
Hey, Konata, you got a minute?
Mm-hmm.
So, is it interesting?
Yeah, unique.
Hmm, well that's good.
Konata, I'm thinking about getting married again,
-and, well, there it is, okay? -Okay.
No, it's perfectly normal you'd be against the idea,
Kanata's your real mom and she always will be,
but that's not what, huh?
Wait a sec, Konata, are you saying if I get married again,
you're okay with it?
Sure, why not?
And you do know that it means
you'll have a new mom, right?
You're still okay with that?
Oh, yeah, so what's my new mom gonna be like?
Yeah, well, I mean it's a pretty serious thing.
You can't take new mothers lightly, unh-unh.
Next question, what is the modest and polite
form of the word... "iku."
That's an easy one, it's... "ukagau."
Yeah, you're right. It's definitely... "ukagau."
I'm with you girls on that one.
-Oh, come on, of course it is. -Mm-hmm.
And the answer is "mairu."
Oh yeah, yeah that's right.
I guess it is, isn't it?
Great, now it's all weird. It's always like this when
someone who thinks they're right finds out they're wrong.
The first multiple choice question is,
which of the following prefectures
do not face towards the ocean?
Is it A, Ibaraki,
or is it B, Tochigi,
or is it C, Kyoto?
It's B!
-B right? -Definitely B.
This one's way too easy.
And the answer is B.
Next question.
The most famous problem in the history of mathematics
was finally proven by Professor Wiles
of Princeton University in 1994.
Which of the following three choices
is the name of that theorem?
Is it A, the Pythagorean theorem,
or is it B, Taylor's theorem,
or C, Fermat's last theorem?
Funny how everyone's so quick to answer when it's obvious,
but when it's not, they all clam up.
Hey, guys, before our spring break's over,
what do you say we all go and hang out at Miyuki-san's?
Awesome idea, I always wanted to see her place,
but it's so far away.
Miyuki-san's rich, I bet her house is really amazing.
I wonder what it's like.
Maybe she's got a swimming pool.
Maybe she's got security guards all around the perimeter.
Oh, come on, that's silly.
Oh, I bet she's got a pet or something like that.
I always pictured her having a white ferret,
a really cute one.
Unh-unh, a dog, a big white dog,
and she's got a big backyard and a white parasol.
Well, the dog's a possibility.
So, that's pretty much how that conversation went.
You're welcome to come over,
but please don't get your hopes up.
For one thing, we don't have any pets at all.
Oh, but one of our neighbors has
all the criteria you're looking for.
They have a big white dog, and I believe a parasol.
Ahh, she said her neighbor's going to be starting
Ryoo high school this year too.
Really?
Hey, you wanna come along if we invite her?
One of my friends has a cousin who will be
starting her first year at Ryoo this spring.
It really is a small world,
don't you think?
Lucky Star.
I'm super sleepy today.
'Course you are, that's 'cause you're
always waking up in the middle of the day.
Oh, there's Konata.
Hey!
Got in the habit of sleeping in too, huh?
I've been gaming my brains out for three days straight.
I'm gonna die.
These guys have one thing in common, they're totally lazy.
Look, we're in the same class again.
Yeah, you're right, isn't that awesome?
Good morning.
Hi, Yuki-chan, good morning.
Morning. Guess what. You're in the same class as us.
Really? Oh, there I am, fantastic.
I hope we all have a great year together.
I second that.
Wow, look we're in the same class.
Mm-hmm.
I hope the two of us have a good year together.
So do I.
Hey, Kagami's in a different class again.
It's not like I don't see you guys all the time anyway.
I mean, if I wasn't in a different class,
you guys would wear me out.
I think it's a shame.
Not even, this is the way it's always been.
Besides, Konata's gonna be swinging by all the time
to borrow notes or a book or something anyway.
You read my mind.
So it's cool, okay? I'll see you guys later.
Okay, sis, see you later.
Hey, Hiiragi,
you think we're in the same class again?
Yep, we're in the same class again.
Man, we've been in the same class together
five years in a row.
Let's have another good one.
Uh...
Yeah, sure.
You see that? Some people are so focused on their goals,
they end up getting all cold-hearted and stuff.
Oh, be nice.
What are we the background scenery or somethin'?
What kind of standards do you think
they use when they split up the classes?
Let's see, I heard they try to sort classes
based on average test scores.
They also separate students depending on
who's related to whom.
Oh, and they also try to put
the troublemakers in different classes.
Ultimately, I think it depends
on the school you're attending.
Well, on TV and in the movies,
they always put all the bad kids in the same class.
It's more compelling.
But high schools are supposed to make sure
that everyone who goes there is at the same level,
so there shouldn't be any troublemakers around.
You do have a point.
Miyuki, this is where you tell her she happens
to be one of the troublemakers at this school,
and you don't want to be seen with a troublemaker do you?
It's nothing like that.
That was the bell, but our teacher's not here yet.
I know, I wonder what's up.
Sit your butts down right now!
That was close, but I made it.
Just barely.
Listen up, I'm Kuroi, your teacher.
Since y'all made it this far,
it's important you guys snap out of vacation mode,
change your ways, and become the awesome students I know you are.
You gotta be kidding me.
I'm not gonna yak all day about
how y'all need to study hard.
But you're all seniors now,
so make your time count while you're here.
Let's get to handing out the class duties.
Takara, you wanna be the class rep
-for the first half of the year? -Oh, yes, ma'am.
I tell ya, once you've been a class rep, it's really hard
to get people to think of you as being anything else.
Yes, that's true.
But it's fine, I really don't mind doing it.
Teachers always decide that stuff
at the beginning of the year.
And since there are so many people we don't know,
it's hard to nominate someone.
Yeah, but we're talking about Ms. Kuroi here,
she picked you 'cause it's gonna be less work for her.
I heard that.
Our teacher's hair was such a mess today.
I think we're going to have
another fun year with Ms. Kuroi, don't you?
Yeah, her classes are always fun.
You know what they say, the teacher's the one
who's supposed to set the tone for the rest of the class.
That totally explains it.
Now I know why the two of you are so lazy.
It's because your teacher is too, isn't it?
I heard that, honey.
I'm Iwasaki, hi there.
Oh, wow, that girl's totally cute.
I was in the same class as her in junior high.
She doesn't talk, man.
All she does is read books. She's kinda creepy.
She's not creepy, she's nice.
I'm the only one who knows what she's really like.
Next.
Oh, I'm coming.
I have to make a good impression.
I'll be bright and cheerful.
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
I'm short like a fifth grader,
but I didn't skip any grades to get here.
Just kidding!
She skipped grades?
- -
I think Onee-chan's geekyness is rubbing off on me.
Okay, how about we figure out the class duties next?
Does anybody wanna volunteer for class rep?
'Course not, who would?
Iwasaki, you were the rep in junior high.
Why don't you volunteer?
Is that true, Iwasaki? You wanna be class rep?
I'm sorry sir, but I'd like to do something different.
Hmm, I would've liked someone with experience.
What do you want to do?
Are you gonna work in the library?
The nurse's office.
I'd like the be the class rep, sir!
She really is nice.
It's springtime, something new is about to happen.
I can feel it.
A new friend,
a new life,
a new love.
With a childhood friend, with an older boy
you have a crush on, or with a strange transfer student.
The anticipation you feel the five seconds
before falling in love.
MK5, that's how I always pictured it to be.
But the reality is you're starting from scratch
with total strangers, how depressing.
Whatever, I'm used to it already.
You're still better off than I am.
Onee-chan!
Hey, Yu-chan, haven't see you all day.
Yeah, I know, I know, not since this morning.
This is the girl who helped me out that one day,
you know, the one I told you about.
Oh, right, awesome, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
See, see? It's just like I told you.
I knew she'd get accepted here and she did.
Yeah, you're right, there she is.
But she could've picked a different school
even though she got accepted here.
But she didn't and now she's here, so it's okay.
Yeah, anyway, Yu-chan, where were you guys headed?
We wanted to find the nurse's office,
'cause I'm sure I'm gonna be seeing a lot of it.
-I hear that. -Oh, I know,
you could show us where it is.
Sure, no problem, I'll show you guys the way.
Where was the nurse's office again?
I don't really know, 'cause I've never had to go there.
You're kidding, you've been here two years
and you still don't know where the nurse's office is?
I can't help if I've been
unusually healthy the last two years.
You went and had your physical exams there.
Actually, I don't think I've ever been inside the art room.
Well you are majoring in music
so you probably don't have the time.
Take me for example, I have yet to venture
anywhere near the Judo hall.
And I just found out a while ago
that we have a tea room here.
Well I guess if you've gone to the same school for three
years, maybe what it is, is that you only go to
the places you need to go, or something like that.
Hate to say it, but I don't go
to the study hall that much.
I always go to the study hall.
No way!
It's the only room quiet enough
where a girl can catch up on her Zs.
I saw Yu-chan hanging out with that girl
she met during the entrance exams.
They were looking. for the nurse's office,
and she said they're both in the same class. It's like a miracle.
If you ask me, it's a miracle that I got to meet Kona-chan
and Yuki-chan here and that we all got to be friends.
Hmm, good point.
It's hard to believe this will be the last year
the four of us will be together like this.
And Kagami was in a different class the whole time.
Thanks for reminding me, buzzkill.
The answer is B, the poison carrot.
This will be on the exam, so make sure to remember it.
Yo, wake up, Izumi.
Potemkin!
What the heck are you dreaming about?
Sorry, teach, I don't know what happened, I was actually
concentrating really hard on not falling asleep.
-Oh? -Yeah, ma'am, but the monster
called sleepiness just kept coming.
Oh, yeah?
It sneaks up on me, I can't dodge it, it's my destiny.
I appreciate your honestly and your attempt
at an explanation, but maybe this'll wake you up.
You never fall asleep in class, Miyuki-san,
is there a trick to it or something?
I can't say there's any trick to it at all.
I really need my sleep so I tend to go to bed
around 11 o'clock at the latest.
In fact, until last year, I'd always be in bed by 10.
No way, that's impossible, she's like a machine.
I knew this stuff was important and I remember taking
notes in class 'cause I knew I'd have to study it later,
but I can't tell what any of this is
'cause I was half asleep when I was writing it.
I can't tell either.
You know what, looking at it now,
I'm thinking how awesome is that
'cause it shows I'm trying really hard to study.
I just wish I could figure out what the hell I wrote down.
They're equations.
Ms. Kuroi.
That's great, ma'am!
You can understand my horrible scribbling?
'Course I can, the only problem is that you
should've been dreaming about world history
'cause that's when you were writing 'em.
Okay.
Kona-chan, what are you doing up so late?
Huh? So it stinks after all.
Uh-oh, I didn't know it was so late.
Ooo, I wonder if anyone else is online. Oh!
You never learn, can't wait to see you in class tomorrow.
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel!
Hi, Luckies! This is Lucky Channel, the show that strives
for world peace, or so they say,
and I'm your navigator Akira Kogami!
And I am the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
I cannot believe we are already on episode 15!
Wait, today's our 15th episode?
That would be correct.
So you're done after today's episode, huh?
Uh...
Bye, me.
Didn't you hear?
Producers said starting with episode 16,
I was gonna be flying solo on Lucky Channel.
Uh-huh, that's what he said,
and he even wished me good luck.
Uh, wait, can't we talk about this?
Hah, I got you, April Fools!
You totally fell for it, didn't you?
Oh, yeah, you got me, oh, yeah, funny.
Sayonara, today's show looked like a blast.
The performance of Haruhi Suzumiya could've been
your twin brother hosting it. He looks so much like you.
I don't think I know what you're talking about.
So when the hell am I gonna get my own concert, huh?
Oh, I don't know.
You guys need to tell me this stuff in advance 'cause my
schedule gets filled up pretty fast these days, buddy!
Sure, I'll check on it right now.
Look, the eastern skies, are burning red.
A circle, it's on, the producers said
it's okay on the next episode.
Yes, I understand.
Akira Kogami's concert is happening
on the next Lucky Channel!
What, really?
Are you serious? You guys booked the arena and stuff?
They twisted a couple arms and got a place, and then.
Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
You're my boy, Itou!
I'm really looking forward to hearing you sing, Akira-sama.
I can host the show for you.
People seem to think I'm an okay emcee, so don't you worry.
I'm so happy right now.
This is gonna be so freaking awesome!
We'll see you guys next week!
Bye-nee!
Oh yeah, are you even gonna be here next time?
I'm a lieutenant.
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three, four...
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"...
-I'm Inari. -I'm Matsuri.
-I'm Miki. -I'm Tadao.
Next time, "Ring."
Look forward to it!
Senior year, Class B...
Ms. Kuroi!
Yeah, yeah.
Good morning, Kagami.
Oh, hey. You look like you're in a good mood today.
You bet I am. I traded in my old cellphone for a new one.
Good, it's about time.
The new cellphones are so cool.
You can set up a song as your ringtone,
and even customize your screen.
Oh, I already tricked it out with my favorites.
Heck of a ringtone you got there.
Yeah, right?
But it kind of sucks 'cause you have to pick up
before the chorus starts playing.
And you know what happens if you don't answer?
It stops in the middle of the song.
I never really got into it,
but okay, if that's how it works.
If I had to choose, Kagami would be an orc.
Why do I have to be the only monster?
Huh. Yes, hello? Hiiragi speaking. Yeah, I know.
I answer the phone at home that way.
Is it just me
or was she super hoppin' mad a couple seconds ago?
What's up with that?
How come women are able to switch gears so fast?
Hmm, that reminds me of what happened the other day.
Hello, Mother, I'm home.
Who is it? Miyuki?
Oh, Miyuki, you have a phone call. It's Konata-chan.
Did I do something wrong or something?
No, it's not you.
You see, my mother is sort of an open book.
She can't conceal her anger very well.
I think she accidentally kicked the corner of her desk.
Oh. Yeah, but I don't get how
any of that relates to opening books.
Her personality's exactly what you see.
You're so smart, Miyuki.
I can always count on you for answers to things.
You help me out so much, you know that?
Getting a compliment from my mother made me so happy
that I got into the habit
of looking up the answers to things.
I can't believe it, Miyuki.
You know more than I do .
As a result, learning new things became a joy.
I guess this means
that I did a bang-up job of raising you, doesn't it?
And that's what she said.
You talk about the loopiest things.
Well, there's one thing I know for sure.
There's absolutely no doubt
that you are your mother's daughter, Miyuki-san.
Are we that alike?
Yep, down to the last pink hair.
Although one thing's for sure,
you really do know a lot of stuff, Miyuki.
And not just the things they teach us in school.
There's so many places to find answers.
That's what ultimately makes learning fun.
Blegh, sounds like a lot of work to me.
I think I'll pass.
I'd rather play and I'll ask for help when I get stuck.
They say selfish people either come
from being the oldest child or the only child.
Come to think of it, Miyuki,
you're an only child, aren't you?
Never mind, I guess it depends on the person after all.
Actually, there is some truth to that.
You see, there's someone at home whose behavior is,
well, slightly older sisterish.
Cleaning is such a chore.
Laundry's exhausting.
I want to order takeout.
You know, we've got two sisters
so we had to get tough fast.
Every time we sat down for dinner,
it turned into a battle for food.
Yay, it's sukiyaki.
Eat up everyone.
Thank you for the food.
Kona-chan was saying how
when you're cell phone isn't getting reception,
it's 'cause the density of the something
or other particles are high.
Wow, you don't say.
Yeah, and she says when the battery goes dead,
it means the situation's silenced.
Boy, you kids are using some strange words these days.
Hey, come on, guys.
We have to leave some for Tsukasa, you know.
Tsukasa, you can have some of mine okay?
Oh, thank you, Sis.
Come on, Kagami.
You were wolfing it down just like everyone else.
Then having siblings is both good and bad.
And there's good and bad things
about being an only child as well.
Like how you space out every now and then, Yuki-chan?
Huh, I space out?
Yeah, you know, like the other day.
I don't know about road apples.
I mean if you were an apple,
-how would you feel? -Ouch!
You okay there?
I'm afraid I was deep in thought and not paying enough attention.
And I walked right into the door.
Oh, Miyuki-san. You concentrate too hard.
That happens to you a lot, huh?
Yes, and it's really embarrassing.
Hold it, if you're doing one thing
and then you start thinkin' about somethin' else
in the middle of doing it,
doesn't it mean that you lack concentration?
Wait, what'd I just say?
I don't know, Miyuki.
That sounds just like you.
I know. Just the other day,
I was warming up a drink in the microwave and...
Oh, I forgot all about it. Silly me.
I'll just warm it up again. Oh!
Oh, I'll have to do it again. Oh! Not again.
Oh.
Oh, Miyuki, you poor thing. You forgot again.
I'm sorry, I did.
I'll take care of it for you.
I'll bring it over when it's ready, okay, hon?
Thanks, Mother, you're the best.
I forgot.
As I was saying, you are your mother's daughter.
I know, it's so embarrassing.
So, Miyuki-san, when did you start wearing glasses anyway?
Hmm, let's see.
I think maybe halfway through elementary school?
Really? If you weren't born with that eyesight,
why'd you have to get glasses?
When I was little,
one of the things I really loved
was how my mother used to read books to me in bed.
My mother always fell asleep before I did
and I wanted to know how the story ended.
So I'd keep reading in the dark.
And that's what happened.
It's good for kids to have a relationship
with their parents, like Miyuki does with her mom.
There's a reason why the kids today seem so aloof.
If they've never experienced a parent's love,
or that kind of intimacy, they eventually end up that way.
You know, I can't remember the last time
I got a big hug from mom.
I wonder if that means I'm at risk.
Oh, not even. Come on, don't you remember?
You were practically attached to mom until the 7th grade.
-No, I wasn't. -You were too.
That's why you're such a goody two-shoes.
Well, in my family, it's the other way around.
Dad's the one who's super clingy.
Maybe that's why you never really grew up.
What you think of that, shorty?
Speaking of kids, haven't there been a lot of cases lately
where young girls get kidnapped or held captive?
Why are you so fascinated by stuff like that anyway?
Because I'm worried about my dad, that's why.
Wow, that didn't sound scary at all.
I guess if you really wanted to,
you could blame behavior like that on games or something.
But I wish they'd stop
'cause it's gonna spoil the fun for the other users.
I wouldn't even begin to know what you're talking about,
'cause none of that stuff is in any of the games I play.
Oh, I just remember that my one year anniversary's coming up.
Yeah, for what?
For my part-time job, that's what.
The guys at work want to do something to celebrate.
Isn't that cool of them?
That's right, I haven't come by to see you yet.
Maybe I'll come visit you while you're working sometime.
It'll be payback for New Year's.
You should come by.
No way. Wouldn't I be bothering you if I came by like that?
Not even.
Gettin' stared at is part of the job so it's no biggie.
Oh, that's right, it's a cosplay cafe.
Just let me know ahead of time
when you wanna cruise by and I'll get you in,
'cause the place can get kind of busy.
Okay, we will.
Excuse me, guys, but class has started.
Lucky Star.
Oh, hey, it's us.
Yeah, we just walked out of the station.
Huh? Yeah, yeah, I'll pick 'em up for you, don't worry.
Sure, bye.
Did Kona-chan say it was okay?
Yeah, she said it's cool to come by,
but we have to go over there
and pick up this month's "Comp" and Lelouch manga for her first.
I hope finding them won't be too difficult.
Me too. She also wants me to get the receipts
stamped by the cashier.
Man, talk about confusing.
Excuse me, do you mind?
I just want to take a picture.
Oh.
But I'm not Kamigishi.
I'm Hiiragi.
Hey, guy, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, over here, can I get a shot please?
No, cut it out.
Could you please say Hiroyuki-chan for me?
Um, Hiroyuki?
We're going now.
This is the first time I've ever been in a store like this.
It's so big, it's overwhelming.
On the phone, she said we couldn't miss it
once we got inside.
I'd get lost if I was in here by myself.
But I bet Kona-chan would feel right at home.
Oh, here it is.
Okay, where the heck do I find a Lelouch manga?
It's not here.
I can't find it either.
Excuse me, I'm having a hard time finding the Lelouch manga.
Where do you keep it?
Oh, we have it right here.
Is this what you're looking for?
What's a Code Geass?
Typical, she could've at least given me the title
to make it easier to find.
Can I get the points for this
put on my card the next time I come in?
Yeah, just make sure you bring your card in
and along with this receipt.
Okay, thanks.
Thank you for shopping with us. Please come again.
Now we can go visit Konata at her job.
I'm really hungry, Sis.
Hang on for a few more minutes.
I'll be getting off work in a bit.
How does she expect us to find it
with a map like this?
Actually, I looked up the location before I left.
According to this, it's over there.
That's our Yuki-chan.
Leave it to Miyuki to save the day once again.
Is this the right place?
Yes, it's on the third floor.
Welcome back, Master.
Won't you come in please?
Make yourselves comfortable.
Okay, the first hour is gonna be 800 yen,
and you get free refills on all soft drinks.
Oh, and the games are all free to play.
And the sweets are all you can eat.
-I think I'll try the eel bowl. -We're out of eel.
Uh, then I guess the shrimp pilaf.
We're not able to do that.
Huh, then how 'bout the spaghetti and meat sauce?
It takes 15 minutes to prepare.
May I?
Okay, let's do it then.
With service like that, how do they stay in business?
Attention, people.
You guys wanna order or what?
Yeah, just hang on a second.
Come on, hurry up.
If you're late, there's a penalty, penalty!
Is this how you treat all your customers?
Yeah, that's kind of the protocol here.
Have you made up your minds yet?
I'll have the melon soda.
Ordinary menu items don't interest me.
Huh?
I'd like to have the milk tea please.
Come on, come on, what do you want?
Chill out, I'm still deciding.
For a brigade member, you sure are slow.
I'm not a brigade member.
You are if you're my customer.
Your brigade leader is not in the mood for any of your lip.
You're giving me a headache.
I don't know, an ice coffee, whatever.
Your brigade leader orders you to wait here.
Oh, brother.
It hasn't been that stinky in a while.
Okay, guys, get ready 'cause the show's about to start.
Oh, wow.
That was an amazing performance.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, she's an exchange student.
And she's in 10th grade.
And she's going to art school.
It's really nice to meet you guys.
My name is Patricia Martin, how do you do?
And guess what, we've also got a CD out. Check it.
You're not seriously trying to sell that, are you?
Oh, excuse me, may I have some tea please?
Absolutely, would you like it hot?
Yes, please. Hot would be perfect.
Oh, may I please have a melon soda?
Melon soda coming up.
Let's see. What's in
the-we-decide-what-juice-we-mix into-this-drink drink?
Yeah, that's classified.
Protocol, baby.
Could this place be any more exhausting?
Oh, no, I'm so tiny.
You'll be fine.
You'll see as you get older, I'm sure you'll grow taller.
Really? You think so?
Hey, Onee-chan.
Oh, hey, Yu-chan.
And then she comes along
and shatters all the hope I had.
Well, I was wondering,
how much taller have you gotten
since you started high school?
Hmm? Oh, I haven't seen a difference
either vertically or horizontally.
I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you.
-Huh? -
- -Oh, don't be sad.
There's a demand out there for you too.
I was wondering if either of you guys
have ever been to a class reunion.
Mm, no, I can't say that I have.
Yeah, I haven't either.
What's up, why you asking?
You know how you hear people saying things like,
"Oh, you haven't changed a bit."
And most of the time, it's meant to be a compliment.
But the only people
who really wanna hear something like that
are the ones who have changed normally.
If you know what I mean.
We know exactly what you mean.
Well, I know you'll are excited
about Golden Week starting up, but first,
I wanna remind you,
you got tests after the holiday,
and those entrance exams that are coming up.
The break's a good time to prep for that stuff.
Also, since there's only a couple days
before vacation starts,
there's no way in hell I'm lettin' you take any sick days.
I'd know that aura anywhere.
No doubt about it.
It's the legendary Girl A.
Is today's target that new book?
Or maybe a collectible. Think, man.
Did you forget that we're in the middle of our spring AV?
That's audio/visual, se-yo.
-Huh? -Not yet, leave her be.
Once her guard's down, pounce on her with a recommendation.
Good, now wait for her to get a little closer.
Closer.
Now, go get her. Goin' in.
Welcome to the store.
These just came in today.
What up, Kagami? Yeah, you outside?
Cool, I'm walkin' out the door now.
She was just killing time waiting for her friend.
The trick to cooking any simmered dish
is to chop all your ingredients into random shapes.
Oh, I never knew that.
Doing it like that increases the surface area
and let's the flavor soak in.
Skim the junk off the top,
and simmer on medium for about 10 minutes.
If it cooks too long, it's no good.
So just stick a toothpick in it
to make sure that it's ready.
Oh, I see.
I still can't get over the fact
that Miyuki is below average in Home Ec class.
I think I'm finally starting to understand
how you see us, Kagami.
Hiiragi-chan, if you don't mind,
would you like to meet us in the library
and study for the exams together?
Oh yeah, sure.
Meh, doesn't it suck how before exams
they cancel the after school stuff
and you end up nothing to do?
It's 'cause you're supposed to be studying.
That's why there's nothing going on.
Yeah, I understand why it's done that way.
It's just that
now that I got all this free time after school,
it's sort of opening up a whole new world for me, you know?
With that kind of time on my hands,
I don't want to sit around and waste my time studying.
I'm gonna get all antsy and stuff.
Okay, so this little study session you guys wanna do,
yeah, you're half the reason we're doing it.
You know that right?
-I'm tired. -Already?
Let's take a break, huh?
Maybe you can't concentrate
because you haven't set a clear goal for yourself.
Don't you have any dreams for the future?
A dream, huh?
It's not really a dream,
but around this time of year,
don't you guys get bored
and wish you could win the lottery or something,
and go and live the easy life somewhere?
That would be cool.
Minegishi, do something about that, would you?
When I'm studying this hard,
I totally need something sweet to eat or I'll die.
The other day, I baked some cookies.
And if you want, after we're done here,
I'll bring you some.
Huh, Minegishi, I didn't know you liked baking.
Not as much as that Ajiyoshi boy.
Hers are way more delish than Ajiyoshi's.
Studying's a total drag.
Sis, I tried baking some madeleines.
What's wrong with you?
Well, uh...
It's not that I'm comparing you to them or anything.
But isn't it weird
how people tend to attract similar types of friends?
I don't see how you could take all this lightly.
I mean you do realize this isn't a canker sore.
Can you believe how many medical shows
are on TV these days?
Tell me about it.
The scary thing is a lot of this stuff could really happen.
Especially to me.
Hmm. When I watch a show like this,
I can't stop thinkin' about how I'm gonna die someday.
And how it's gonna happen. The possibilities are endless.
Could we change the subject? It's starting to get depressing.
You have to stay alive, you hear, live.
Oh, hey, Sis.
Could you help me with this?
Let's see.
"Curses, like chickens,
"come home to roost"? I got it.
Yeah, Chris like chickens. So when he comes home,
he's gonna wanna have roast chicken for dinner, see?
I think. Oh, hey, Sis.
Could you tell her what the rest of this means?
Wowzers.
"When you make the contract..."
Sorry, I'm not good at stuff like this.
Oh, this totally reminds me.
The other day I was working at the shrine
and I heard some tourist talking about
why the arch is called a torii.
Yeah, what'd they say?
They say birds, torii, carry the dead.
And the arch was a place for them to rest.
So they called it a tori-ee.
Bird, stay,
tori-ee, toree, tree, get it?
They know more about Japan than we do.
It would've been faster if I just asked Kagami about it.
Lucky Star.
In the sea of Japan,
you can feel the chill in your bones.
Where has the one I love gone?
She's over there,
swimming alone through the rough waves of show business.
She's singing a song, Misoji Misaki.
Akira Kogami, ladies and gentlemen.
Shut your hole, you call this a concert?
We're over budget as it is.
This is like bringing someone to--
We're starting.
I'm a professional, you f--
- -Come in.
I'm so sorry for the wait.
I have your drinks right here, sir.
Great, thanks.
Whoa, hey, hold it, Sebastian.
The brown one's for me, buddy.
Damn that's good .
Let's see.
Where's Kentai Life Returns?
I like that one.
Huh?
Hello?
Yeah, hang on.
Wanna extend? Mm.
No, thanks, we're good.
Sure, okay, thanks.
We got to be out in five.
It's time to clean up.
Clean up, clean up.
Bye-nee!
Man, I don't wanna be a solo artist
without a single.
♪ I for- for- forgot my bag. ♪
On the next episode of "Lucky Star."
Wrong.
Come on, Nagato, we're gonna lose the audience like that.
You need to sound more happy.
You know, like that voice you hear on TV
on Sunday nights around 6:30.
Now try it again, go.
On the next episode of "Lucky Star."
But you didn't change any-- oh, whatever.
Next time, "Base Of The Sun."
Look forward to it.
Ahem. I mean, rock, paper, scissors.
Da da da da da da da da.
Senior year, Class B...
Ms. Kuroi!
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Kagami. Do you like those chocolate wafer thingies?
Sure I do. Why?
I knew it. Then these are for you. Enjoy.
Oh, thank you.
Wow!
I love these things!
I've got more if you want. Here.
And there's more
where that came from,
so dig in, guys.
Whoa, hang on. What's with you and all the wafers?
Yeah, well,
they come with toys, so I have
to buy the wafers by the case in order to get the toy I want.
Oh, that figures. I should've known you'd be the type
to ignore a perfectly good snack for a cheap toy.
Hmmm. A fox.
And you're a squirrel, a dog.
Huh?
Okay, now what are you talking about?
Oh. I was just thinking about what kind of animals
we'd be is all.
Since I'm kind of a prankster, I'd be a fox,
and Tsukasa sort of has a doggy vibe.
Yu-chan's got the cute rodent thing happening,
so she'd be a squirrel.
Yeah, I can see that.
I bet next you're gonna say how I'm like a tiger or wolf, right?
Hmm? Nah, I picture you as a rabbit 'cause you're
always getting lonely and stuff.
Besides, your pig tails look like ears.
Okay, that visual is totally embarrassing.
Could we talk about something else now?
That's so funny. I wonder what everyone else would be.
Yui Na-san's always running around, so she'd be a leopard.
And Iwasaki-san's so cool and awesome,
I think she'd be a hawk.
Yuki-chan's got that fluffy feeling about her.
Kind of fumo-fumo, so I picture her as a sheep.
Hmmm. I hate to disagree with you,
but Miyuki-san's more of a cow type. Especially with those.
You're like a pervy old man.
So we were hanging out at Konata's yesterday
and found some of her old journals from elementary school.
Oh! That sounds interesting.
Strange is more like it. I mean no offense, Konata,
but I never figured you'd hang onto stuff like that.
Dad always told me to keep that stuff
'cause you never know. You know?
If you think that's surprising,
check out what she wanted to be when she grew up.
Our girl here wrote about how she wanted
to be something normal, like a vet or a lawyer.
They are noble professions.
Yeah, but it's the way she changed her dreams every year.
That's totally Konata.
It's weird how when I go back and read my old journals,
I can tell what games and manga I was into.
Okay. Games and manga. We always end up here.
It could be worse. You could be one of those people
who say being a bride is their dream job.
Hello? That's not a job.
That sounds really cute, though.
Yeah. Tsukasa, the truth is, I was talking about you.
Huh? Really? Are you sure?
Positive.
You're what they call an airhead.
A lot of airheads don't realize they're really airheads.
It seems you may be right about that.
Oh, Miyuki-san.
You've just proven my point.
What? Do I have something on my face?
Hey, Miyuki-san, how bad's your eyesight
without your glasses?
It's way under 20/200.
Oh, is that so? You know, I heard somewhere
that eating blueberries was really good for your eyes.
Oh, they are. You can also eat carrots,
which contain vitamin A. And green leafy vegetables
like spinach are good.
There's also pork, which contains vitamin B.
And foods like liver and sesame seeds, both rich in protein,
are also good things to eat to help maintain good vision.
Or there's also the option of Lasik treatments,
which are popular.
Oh.
The thing is, I lack the courage
to go through an ordeal such as that.
Although the vision training programs
I've seen on TV sound quite promising.
Wow. You sure know a lot, don't you?
Well, those are just a few of the many options out there.
So, if you know about all this stuff,
how come your eyesight's not any better?
Oh! I guess I just never got around to trying any of it.
Oh, yeah? Why not?
I'm sorry. I don't know why.
It's never too late to start, right?
Why don't you try the vision training thing?
I suppose I could.
Okay, let's see. First, you close your eyes.
Then you open them quick. The trick is
to keep your head still. Then you look to the left,
and then to the right, without moving your head.
Miyuki-san! Your head, it totally moved when you looked!
Really? Oh, oh, dear.
How strange. Whoa. Easy now, girl.
My eyes are tired now than before.
I hope it didn't make your vision worse.
Hey, Kona-chan? What does "moe" mean?
Hmm. How does one define something like that?
Uh. How?
I know you definitely use that word to express
how much you like something,
but I don't have a solid definition for it.
Hold it. How can you use a word
and not know what it means?
All I can say is that the only people
who really understand what "moe" means are
the hardcore-iest of hardcore otaku.
Not that it matters much, but I actually think
I sort of know what you mean.
We're gonna check out doggies
from around the world! Daffundah!
Puppies are so cute, aren't they?
Wouldn't it be super neat if we got a dog?
Hmm?
Whoa. Slow down, Tsukasa.
You better think about what you're asking for.
Will you be able to take care of it?
You know, train it, walk it, feed it.
Are you still going to think it's cute when it grows up?
And are you even mature enough to take care
of a living being?
Yeah. You're right, sis. I guess it's something I need
to think about a little harder.
It's good that you know what it's like to have a dog.
Oh, well, well, not really. I mean, what do I know
about having a dog? I just looked it up is all.
Oh, come on now! You said you liked this artist, right?
Just give it a shot!
Jeez, okay, but you're too close.
And you're freaking me out.
Staaaaaaaaaaaaare.
Staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaare.
Okay. What is it?
Oh, nothing. I was just wondering how far you got.
Has a character called Osano showed up?
No, I haven't reached that level yet.
Well, go on, hurry up, keep reading.
There are so many elections
going on right now. That really blows.
You think so?
What's with the gloomy look on your face, lady?
You should be studying for your college entrance exam.
Oh, ma'am, I was just saying how it sucks
to have all these elections.
The heck are you talking about?
I'm talking about how the regular shows
get shuffled around 'cause of all the election coverage.
I mean, the other day, this one show got
pushed back four whole hours!
And they always interrupt the regular broadcast
with election updates! And that L-shape thing they use
makes the screen way smaller!
Hold on there, missy. That awful election programming
helps you keep up on your current events.
There's other things besides anime.
Besides, elections aren't the only things throwing programs
out of whack. Look at K-1. They're always kicking shows
to the curb to get on the air.
I mean, come on, I thought you liked martial arts.
I've got experience,
but I really don't like it that much.
But even anime shows
have special programs,
don't they? My honey!
But they don't run into overtime
and cause problems for the show that comes after it!
But kids facing
college entrance exams shouldn't worry about that!
They should study!
It comes down to
a power attack after all!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Kona-chan's stuck 'cause she didn't bring an umbrella today.
You could at least watch the forecast.
Maybe I should just walk home and not care if I get wet.
You know, like all the guys do.
I always wondered why all the boys never cared
about getting wet in the rain.
'Cause they don't have to worry
about their bras showing through.
You're so smart.
Okay, you got a point. But you don't have to
broadcast it to the whole school.
Ever hear of modesty?
Could either of you hook a girl up with an umbrella?
Tsukasa and I are both going straight home now,
so I guess we can get by sharing an umbrella.
Ah, you guys are the best.
How come you don't keep an umbrella in your locker?
You know, to keep your books company.
Well, it's funny you should mention it,
'cause I did used to keep an umbrella in there.
But I had to use it one time,
and then I forgot to bring it back the next day.
It's not like umbrellas are part of my daily routine.
With an attitude like that, go figure you'd forget.
Wait up, Suzume! I said wait!
That reminds me. Whenever I'm wearing rubber boots
and a raincoat, I always think about
how dorky I must look to everyone.
Yeah, I know. You feel sorta immature
wearing stuff like that.
So how come when you see it
in art and stuff,
it gives off this "moe" vibe?
Like I would know.
Lucky star.
Oh, hi-ya, Konata. What's up?
Good morning!
Hey, Tsukasa, what's with the sad face?
Oh, this month's cell phone bill was really high,
so I got scolded for it.
You should try my method. I hardly ever use my cell phone,
so all I pay is the basic rate.
Oh, I see.
It's way more economical.
Okay, how is it economical when you're paying
the basic monthly rate for a cellphone you hardly ever use?
That sounds like a waste of money.
You really need to stop sweating the small stuff, Kagami.
Oh, a text.
"Could you please pick up some eggs on your way home today?"
"Don't worry, I will
"go to
"the store with sis
right after school today."
There!
Let me guess.
That was a conversation between you and your parents?
It's funny how when you're texting your parents,
you can't help but speak politely.
Yeah, I sort of get where you're coming from,
but trust me, that'll change once you get used to it.
Mm-hmm.
How long have you had your cellphone anyway?
For about a year now.
And when do you usually replace it with a new one?
I heard you're supposed to do that every two years.
They say that's when your battery starts dying anyway.
Then I'll make mine last twice,
no, I'll make it last three times as long. I swear it!
Why are you spazzing out again?
I'm just saying I take super good care of all my stuff.
I make everything last longer.
Especially when you don't use the stuff you have.
I guess some people are like that.
They splurge on all their hobbies,
and they're stingy with everything else.
Sorry to bother you, sis.
May I borrow your world history textbook?
Again? Oh, man, you are so helpless.
Here. And try not to forget your book next time, okay?
Okay.
I'll bring it back later today.
I guess your sister can be pretty careless sometimes, huh?
Yeah. I guess that's all the more reason
why I have to be the responsible one in the family.
Hmmm. Yeah, but is that good for her though?
I mean, if you're always there to bail her out,
there's no reason for her to act any different.
So it's because of you
that your sister's the way she is, Hiiragi.
Huh. She does have
a point there.
I wonder.
Hey, Hiiragi, what time is it?
I don't know. The clock's right there.
Oh. There it is.
Ah! The legend of your morning temper is for reals!
Oh, come on. I dropped it and a little piece broke off.
Reading manga's nice, Tsukasa,
but try to read a newspaper once in a while.
You'll learn a whole lot about the world around you.
Okay. Mm-hmm.
Let's see.
Oh, reading a newspaper is way too hard!
I mean, it's like, when I read a line,
I don't know where the next one starts!
Yeah, I kind of figured you'd have a little problem with that.
Oh, hey, guy. How's it going?
Yeah? What's up?
For starters, how about you call Ms. Kobayakawa over here?
I'm a senior. Tell her Izumi's here to see her.
Yeah, sure. Hey, Kobayakawa!
Izumi-sempai, the senior, wants to see you!
Hey, Onee-chan! What's up?
Ah, I love how they get all polite and stuff
when they find out that I'm older than they are.
They're cute when they do that.
I wish I was as
tall as you, Iwasaki-san.
Huh?
I wonder why there's so much of a difference.
Well, I can't be certain.
Maybe it's because I drank lots of milk or something.
I get it! It's because you work hard
on it every day, isn't it?
No. If only life were as simple as that.
I'd love to see a little bit of growing happening
somewhere else for a change.
Huh?
Hey, guys, it's raining.
So we're gonna be playing dodge ball
in the gym today for PE.
I always pictured you as being the last girl standing
on the courts, Iwasaki-san.
I think you look really tough.
If I'm playing infield, I end up being one
of the last ones left, too.
Maybe it's 'cause I'm small and I'm hard to hit.
Hmm. They both survive the game,
but for very different reasons.
I'd feel awful if I hit Kobayakawa-san, though.
Darn it. It sucks they put us on different teams today.
We get to be on the same team, though.
Iwasaki-san seems like she's really good at sports.
I bet she's ruthless out there.
It's okay. I asked to be put in the outfield so it's all good.
I'm glad.
Iwasaki-san's
such a good person.
Ready to pound these guys, Kobayakawa-san?
Mm-hmm.
And you're okay with her trying to nail you?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I bet you are--
I mean, let's have a good game, okay?
Ah! Oh.
Plowed by the girl who works in the nurse's office.
Are you okay?
You were pretty amazing out there, Iwasaki-san.
You pop everybody you aim for, don't you?
Oh, you think so?
You've got great reflexes and targeting skills.
Whatever.
What happened?
Is she upset because I was making a fuss over her?
Oh, no. She's just embarrassed is all.
Yeah? Well I guess it's okay then.
I can't really tell with her.
Oh, wow.
She's the type who always
gets misunderstood by others.
I guess if they don't know her,
they totally get the wrong impression.
Have you gone on any cool trips since you came to Japan?
Uh-huh. I went to all the sacred places.
Sacred places?
Yeah! I paid my respects
at the three most sacred places in Japan.
Did you go to Kamakura, Kyoto, and Nara?
Oh, no. I went to Akiba in Tokyo,
Nipponbashi in Osaka,
and Osu in Nagoya.
Huh?
And I'm going to go visit all the important places
around here as well.
You mean like, Tokyo Tower and Asakusa?
No, not those places.
Like, Nakano and Kichijoji.
Okay.
Ah!
Are you okay?
Yeah. I just got some dust in my eye is all.
Can I see?
Are you sure you're gonna be all right?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Look at them! Don't they look awesome like that?
Ugh, how can I stare at my friends like that?
God, I'm such a pervert!
Hello.
Hi, come on in.
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go get some drinks.
Huh?
Hmm.
She's got a lot of books.
I sure hope you guys are okay with--
Agh!
Wow, Hiyori. I didn't know you were into stuff like this.
Kill me now. Just please, kill me now.
Hurry. Do it fast.
I think these are her newest sketches.
Oh, look at how much she's improved.
You're right. She's really good.
I can't believe how much this looks like Iwasaki-san.
Yeah?
Oh! It's Takarazuka!
Is that supposed to be me?
Are you making a fairy tale?
Mm-hmm.
Wow. I'd like to read it when you're done!
Oh, God! I have to stop drawing my friends like this.
I'm such a pervert.
Hey, Tamura-san. Would you like to go to Otome Road?
Yeah, I was thinking about going.
What's Otome Road? Is it near here?
You've never heard of Otome Road?
No. I haven't either.
Oh, Yadeyade does.
It's called Otome Road, huh?
Otome Road, or "Maiden Road" is a street
on the west side of Sunshine 60 in Ikebukuro, Tokyo.
You'll find lots of stores that specialize
in manga and anime, and shops that carry figures and stuff.
It's a gathering place for otaku
almost on the same level as Akiba,
but unlike the scene in Akiba,
there's way more girl otaku than boys.
That's why they nicknamed the street Otome Road.
It's known as the street where the Fujoshi go to hang out.
Fujoshi?
It's written as "rotten girl" but read as "spoiled lady."
Rotten girl?
Yeah, now that you mention it, they are kind of rotten.
Oh!
Ahh.
Come on, it's the three second rule.
You know, the three second rule?
You got like five seconds
before the germs start hopping on it.
I didn't say anything. I'm just sitting here.
Mmm!
Ah!
No!
Not my meatball.
What happened to the three second rule?
Okay, that rule only applies in certain situations
so ease up, will you?
Lucky Star.
Lucky Channel! Hiya, Luckies!
Hi! We're back again with another edition
of your favorite show.
They said it couldn't be done,
but we've made it to the 18th episode of Lucky Channel!
And all of you should know who I am by now.
Uh-huh. I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami! And this is--
Hi, guys!
I'm the one who's trying super hard to be the best assistant
Akira-sama's ever had. I'm Minoru Shiraishi.
Anyway, here's the theme for today.
We're introducing all the new characters
appearing on the show.
So let's get this thing started with a big fat bang.
You feel me?
A big fat bang.
For starters,
we've got Konata-san's cousin,
Miss Yutaka Kobayakawa.
Her classmates are Miss Minami Iwasaki,
Miss Hiyori Tamura,
and Miss Patricia Martin.
Next up, we have Kagami-san's classmates.
Miss Misao Kusakabe,
and Miss Ayano Minegishi.
The cast is filled out quite nicely, don't you think?
I'm sure this stuff's old news to most of you guys.
These ladies have been a part of the opening credit
since the very beginning of the--
How many girls are they gonna bring out
before I get my friggin' turn? It's already episode 18!
Actually, you made an appearance in today's episode, Akira-sama.
You looked ultra cute in that raincoat
and rubber boots outfit. Huh?
Hey, you know, that reminds me of something.
I had a chance to speak to Anizawa-san
after last week's show and he told me something interesting.
He said there's one thing an actor needs more than anything,
and that's presence.
Even though you were only in the show for a split second,
when you appeared, it was like,
"Whoa. That was Akira Kogami! Didn't she--"
Whatever.
Ugh.
Hey. Yeah, sorry.
I said, "hey." No, everything's okay.
No way. Is it time to say goodbye already? Bummer!
We really wanna know what you guys think about the show,
so please, please, please, keep your comments coming, okay?
You can either email us or call into our radio show.
Well, bye me! Turn it off!
Thanks, guys.
Texting? What? I'm sorry?
You were texting. No, well, not really.
Who were you texting?
My, uh, parents. Why?
They want me to visit. What'd you tell them?
Well, you know. I don't.
Wait, no, I--
On the next episode of "Lucky Star."
I'm Hiyori. I'm Patricia.
Patty, you like your job? Yeah, it's awesome!
I'll bet the first-time customers
that come in to the cafe have a lot more fun when you're around.
Well, actually,
I don't deal with first-timers.
Oh, really?
I only serve
the regular customers.
You know, the ones who drop serious cash?
Yeah, that's the cafe's policy.
Wow, that's harsh.
Next time, "There's Substance in 2-D."
Look forward to it.
Senior year, Class B!
Miss Kuroi!
Yeah, Yeah.
Guess what?
I'm raising a pet dog in a game I'm playing,
and the little guy's so cute I can't help talking to him.
Wow!
Yeah, I know, and even though it's in a game,
I notice that I talk to it like it's a real animal,
like all cutesy and stuff.
Yeah, I totally know what you mean.
When I talk to my goldfish, my voice gets all high-pitched
and sweet sounding.
I can see talking to dogs and cats that way, but a fish?
That's something only a lonely, desperate person would do.
What'd you say?
That sounds like prejudice, damn you!
I see your face! Don't you pity me!
Talking about doggies reminds me
of this question I've had.
There's this one command I heard where the trainer says,
"Chin, chin," so do you guys know what that means?
Oh, oh, uh, if I start explaining it,
we could be here for quite a while.
Oh, let's just say the term is Chinese
and leave it at that, shall we?
Okay, all those who just thought of something X-rated
raise your hands.
It's weird how "Gun " still really popular
with lots and lots of people.
I know, I get when I watch it.
And come in lots
of different varieties, too.
You know, like "V," and "W," and "X."
Yep, I've been watching it since the beginning
so I know 'em all by heart.
You could say it's my duty as a fan.
Okay, then, if a show called "Gun Serial Murders"
was on, would you watch it?
Or a show like "Detective Gun ,"
would you watch that?
Yes, if you really love "Gun ," then it's
your to watch those shows.
?
Although it's not if you can't refer to it
using a letter.
All this talking about made me realize
something, I know I'm kind of small for my age and
everything but I'm years older
than .
Time sure , doesn't it?
Can you believe that
in two years I'm going to be the same age as ?
Isn't that crazy?
Well, you know, a really
character even in the world of "Gun ."
Same goes for .
The thing is, you can't compare your to them.
I mean, you're awfully for your age.
Shock! It would have been better if you said that
I looked for my age.
Whatever, you're still a cutie pie.
- -Hmm?
Look at what the neighbors got us from their vacation.
I bet it's a valuable souvenir.
What is it, a vase?
I can't believe how awesome you turned out!
You're so damn cute, you're my kind of girl.
It's too hot for hugs, Dad, and what you just said
sounded really pervy.
Oh, it's morning.
I got so hammered last night, I figured I'd be passed out
for most of the day.
Oh well, I guess I'm still young.
Up next is the morning news for today,
Monday, July the 2nd.
Wait, what happened to Sunday?
Where'd my weekend go?
Whenever I've got an exam, I always make it a point to
stay up the night before to study for it but I don't get
far 'cause I get sleepy.
I asked sis for advice and she said.
You don't like scary movies, right?
What if you watch one before you start studying
and maybe it'll keep you up for the night.
Remember last time?
You jumped into my bed and wouldn't leave.
So I watched a horror movie and I stayed awake all night.
Your sister always knows what to do, doesn't she?
Yeah, but now when it gets dark
and I hear a noise, I start thinking
that there's something sneaking up behind me.
Now it's even harder for me to concentrate
on studying than before.
Anyway, I haven't slept too good since then
so now I'm tired in class.
But for someone who claims she doesn't like horror movies,
you seem to watch a lot of them regardless.
Believe me, if I had a choice, I wouldn't.
Come to think of it, my mother's the same way.
Hey, Miyuki, would you like to watch this movie
with me tonight?
I'm too scared to watch it alone.
I heard that people who scare easily tend to watch lots
of movies of that sort, perhaps they secretly like it.
No, Yuki-chan, you're wrong.
I really, really hate horror movies, really!
Do you understand this problem, Iwasaki-san?
I'm stuck on that one, too, and I was gonna keep at it.
If I couldn't figure it out, I was gonna ask Miyuki-san to
help me with it.
Oh, yeah, hey, aren't we lucky that both of us
know people who are seniors?
They'll totally help us if we ask 'em.
And that's what Iwasaki-san and me were
talking about at school today.
No way, she's got too much faith in me!
She's gonna find out real quick
just how harsh reality really is!
Hey, Na-san, before you and Ki got married,
did you guys ever go and study together?
No, why?
I always see that set up in games and stuff but if you're
with a boy you like and you have to study, there's no way
you'd be able to concentrate on homework.
And if you can't concentrate, that's when
your mind wanders and you start to fantasize.
And that's about the time the withdrawals set in.
Oneichan, could you show me how to do this part?
I'm sorta slammed right now so
why don't you ask Yui-neisan? Gotta study, study, study.
Why you little.
Well, I went to a different school and they never
really taught us anything like this, so.
Oh, no!
What a lame excuse.
I'm kinda stuck myself.
Do you understand any of this stuff?
I bet you don't, Oneisan!
You know,if you already know I don't know,
don't even ask me.
Didn't you see what just happened with Yutaka?
Maybe I should just call Miyuki-san and ask her.
I don't wanna bother her though.
Yeah, it's kinda late.
Maybe you can call her about it tomorrow?
Why don't you ever come to me with things
like homework and stuff?
You can trust me, I'm your dad!
C'mon, man, give me a shot!
I'll fix you good!
Morning, wakey, wakey!
Even though corporal punishment in the classroom's
been banned, you love hitting people.
Not that I'm complaining or anything.
That's true but I don't hit just anybody.
If I don't pick my targets carefully, I could get
into a lot of trouble, if you know what I'm saying.
Wow, she even admits it, she's so amazing.
Banning corporal punishment, what are they thinking?
That's it for today, see y'all tomorrow!
Hey, Miyuki-san, sorry to bug you but I don't get any
of the names of these eras.
Could you show me how to do this problem, Yuki-chan?
Why are they always asking her?
How come you guys never
ask me about the stuff you don't get?
Wait up, Ms. Kuroi!
Hey, Izumi, what's up?
Well, I sorta had a little question for ya.
Sure, ask me anything you want!
That's what I'm here for!
In this game I'm playing right now,
there's this rare item in it and--
woah, ma'am, what's wrong?
That's not what I had in mind.
Why's the day after a typhoon always so darn hot?
It's called typhoob-ikka but I hope the mom and dad typhoons
leave the kids at home next time.
Nice word play!
Wait, what do you mean by word play?
You do know that what you just said was
a play on words, don't you?
Hmm?
Hey, sis?
I hope I'm not bothering you
but I sorta had a question.
Sure, come on in.
What'd you wanna know?
It's about what happened this morning.
Did Kona-chan say something that was weird?
'Cause I sorta didn't see anything wrong
with what she said either.
How can you be as dense as Konata?
We watch the news together!
What the hell?
It's like you guys have bad timing
on purpose or something.
Pitcher's eyeballing the runner
on second--
Hey, how much longer's the baseball game gonna be on?
It sorta looks like it's gonna be running long again.
Again? jeez!
Now I gotta reset the timer on the recorder.
Oh man, why can't they just block off more time
to begin with?
You know, dad?
That's the problem with pro ball.
The players always drag out every little move.
I mean, would it kill anyone to pick up the pace?
'Cause if the players did that, they might actually be able
to finish a game on time for once.
Yeah, well,
I think the pacing is one of the things people
like about it and besides, the players need time to
concentrate, so.
Well, have you gotten used to everything at school yet?
Yeah, but there's lots of homework so it's kind of hard.
You'll live.
Since you're all focusing on your college entrance exams,
I bet you guys don't have much homework to do these days.
Huh?
Okay, Konata.
What, I don't know where she got that.
Man, is it hot out or what?
What are you doing?
Put some clothes on or something.
What if Yu-chan starts walking around like that?
C'mon, it's been really hot lately.
Besides, what's that thing politicians are doing?
Cool biz?
Yeah, that!
No, that's different.
What the heck are you doing down there?
Just waiting for someone to text me back.
Don't you hate that?
While I was reading my book, I missed my station again.
I don't think I'll ever get sick of your klutziness,
Miyuki-san, it's so cute!
I dunno about cute, sounds more like a hassle to me.
You gotta be kidding, the way she gets all embarrassed
about it afterwards, hello, moe!
It's super cute when you got a couple flaws you can exploit.
Oh yeah, so when you're at work, you're all,
"Oh no, I tripped, I'm so terribly sorry, sir!"
or something lame like that?
Kagami, when you did that thing just now,
you looked pretty stupid.
I was just giving an example!
You're the one who brought it up in the first place!
Whatever, go on, tell us about how you act all clumsy
just to score points with your customers.
No way, not me, you'd think something like that
would happen in my cafe but if it did,
the manager'd chew my butt out for it.
Really, 'cause I thought you'd be tripping on your feet
every five minutes, saying it's all moe and stuff.
Uh-uh, it's true that clumsy girls are cute
and there's tons of moe there
but the fact is it's only fun to see that stuff happening
in games and anime.
If your always breakin' stuff in real life,
it'd be irritating.
You otaku types are really harsh, for geeks that is.
So if we have a contestant with a perfect
score today, TV will be giving one lucky viewer
a month-long trip across the tundra.
On variety shows and quiz shows on TV,
you see 'em giving out all kinds of prizes.
You know, like trips and lots of cash.
Maybe they get more contestants when they do it that way.
I bet their ratings go up a lot when they get someone
really popular to appear on the show, huh, sis?
I dunno, I guess so.
Ooh, here's a thought.
What if these shows let the whole audience participate
and gave them the prizes instead?
Don't you think that would make their ratings
go up even more?
Maybe but I don't think a TV game show would be
that straight forward.
Good mornin', ladies.
Hey, you!
Anyway, I was playin' this game yesterday
and I got to thinking.
Do either of you know who the school idol at our school is?
Okay, what the heck's a school idol anyway?
Is it like a Miss Ryouou or something?
Yeah, I guess that's sorta what I'm talkin' about.
But if it's anything like how it's supposed to be in a game,
you get to have groupies and stuff.
Oh, man, was that a grueling day or what?
Whew, that feels good!
Wait, I gotta wake up early tomorrow.
It's better I stay off the computer and just hit the sack.
I don't wanna be late for class.
I can't believe I'm making sleep a priority!
Hell, when I was still in school,
I was too busy having fun to sleep.
I'm getting old.
"Lucky Star."
Uh, Tamura-san, you've been making all those faces.
Are you okay?
Yeah, you know how when you draw, you make the same faces
as the characters you're drawing?
Yeah, I get it, you were drawing something, huh?
I didn't know you drew manga, Tamura-san, that's cool.
Yeah, well, it's only doujin, so.
What kind of stories do you like to draw?
Well, just your typical four panel stuff.
And some romance-y type manga between
my favorite characters, too.
Tough question.
I bought this lottery ticket the other day
and I won 3,000 yen with it.
So there I was thinking how awesome
the rest of my day's gonna be.
Woah, you're so lucky!
But on the way to school, my bike got a flat and my lunch
exploded all over the sidewalk so I used some of the money
to fix the flat and the rest to buy some lunch
from a convenience store.
And that's pretty much all the money I won.
They say that truth is stranger than fiction, I guess.
Whatever.
I guess in the end it'll make a good story for a manga
someday so it's all good.
She's so tough.
An artists' drawing hand is her life.
I'd give my life to save it.
She's really tough.
Wow, you're super talented, Tamura-san!
I don't know what's going on with me.
That drawing's pretty darn awful.
Oh, but here's a little something I just finished
that I think rocks super hard.
Whatever, I shouldn't expect most people to get
where an artist is coming from or pick up on all
the subtle details in the lines.
I should know better than that.
Holy crap, I forgot it!
What happened, are you okay?
Oh, it's my favorite mechanical pencil.
I was drawing yesterday and I left it home back on my desk.
Wanna borrow mine?
No, man, it's gotta be her, I'm used to the way she feels.
The way she just flows across the page, I--
Yeah, you're right, mechanical pencils are all the same.
Uh-huh, yes they are.
Yeah, I knew you guys would react like that.
I totally knew that, I knew that.
The sucky-ist thing about it's that I got totally lost
in there, I couldn't get out for three hours.
Is anything wrong, Tamura-san?
How embarrassing!
What are they thinking dressing like that in public?
Is it the coat?
Wow, it's summer
and they're dressed like that.
They must be hot.
This kind of pain's reserved
for the ones who know about it.
Hang on a second, I gotta send these to someone.
Welcome, ladies.
Wow, it's super crowded.
I'll go put my name on the sheet.
It was fun, 'cause oneichan and me stayed up late again
playing a video game.
Suzaka-sama, Suzaka-sama, part of three?
Oh, hey, that's us.
But I didn't hear them call your name.
That was someone else's.
Any time I have to put my name on a waiting list,
I write down the name of one of my favorite characters.
It kinda makes me feel a little closer to 'em.
Know what I'm saying?
Awesome, you can find my people everywhere.
Oh, thanks a lot!
If there's one thing I'd wish for,
I'd wish I could be as slender and tall as you are.
I think that'd be so cool.
I want you to know, Minami-chan,
that I admire you so very much and I--
Yutaka.
Well, I'm sure you're not done growing yet so don't worry.
You never can tell.
Perhaps you'll even be taller than me someday.
You really think so?
Minami-chan.
Minami-chan.
Minami-chan!
Woah, hold it, stop!
That totally goes against the laws of nature
and that last shot is so wrong it's insane
and I need to calm down!
Are you feeling okay, Tamura-san?
You're looking really pale, wanna go to the nurse's?
I was up all night drawing my brains out,
trying to make the deadline for this contest I'm in,
and even though I didn't get any sleep,
I still made it to the courier's in time.
It's okay, when I work really hard on something,
I feel all shiny inside,
like I'm dissolving into little tiny blobs of light.
She's really super tough.
Oh, Tamura-san!
What does "yaoi" mean?
That depends on which one you mean.
"Lucky Star."
"Lucky Channel"!
Hiya, luckies!
Are you guys ready for the 19th episode of "Lucky Channel"?
We're almost at the end of the season.
Can you guys believe it?
I'm Akira Kogami, your guide!
And I'm her assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
I hope everyone's having a good day today.
Wow, you look like you're in a good mood, Akira-sama!
You must have done something fun last night.
I wonder what it could've been.
Go on, take a guess!
Well, I think I'll pass, I just ate.
Man, this TV gig's really getting on my nerves these days.
I'm tellin' ya, after 19 episodes, I'm startin' to feel
like I need a vacation, do some unwinding.
Maybe soak in a hot spring.
I'd be nice if I can win something like that trip they
were talking about in the main segment today.
Hang on, if you want to win a trip like that,
you're gonna have to become a contestant on that quiz show
that was playing in the background.
Vacations are cool, aren't they?
I'd like to go on one!
Traveling through foreign lands.
They say it's good for the soul, don't ya know?
Are you saying you like to travel?
I'll say I do, I love it!
Traveling's the best and I should know,
'cause I've done a lot of it!
I climbed to the top of Mount Takao and I went to Jogashima.
I'm what you might call the outdoorsy type.
Huh, so your outdoorsy.
Nothing calms your jangling nerves like
a walk in the woods surrounded by Mother Nature's splendor.
It's the best in the world!
Sure, Mother Nature, walking in the woods while you're
jangling your nerves, sounds like a real blast, man.
Yeah, doesn't it?
Leaving all the noise of the city behind,
letting nature take you in her hands,
soothing your mind and body.
Mm-mm-mm, yeah, that Mother Nature sure does sound hot.
I know, isn't she awesome?
You wanna go for a walk in the woods?
Are you serious, can I go?
If you're serious, I'll totally go, I'll go right now, yes!
Then you're going on Minoru's Mother Nature Tour.
Have fun.
They've got everything you want.
So, where am I going on tour exactly?
Fuji.
Huh, oh.
Well I've already climbed a mountain before so, uh--
You're not going up to the mountain.
I want you to go up to Fuji Forest.
Oh, I get it, the forest, okay.
Fuji Forest.
Me, seriously?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so once I get to the forest,
is there anything in particular I should be--
Go and bring me back some water.
Water?
Yeah, the famous Fuji water!
And I want it straight from the source.
Are you kidding?
You can just buy a bottle of it at the store!
I like my water fresh!
I'm not going alone, am I, am I, am I?
Someone's coming with me, right?
It's okay, you'll be fine.
The director and producer have agreed to sacrifice
themselves along with you, isn't that nice?
Let's the lady her water!
Don't get yourselves killed out there.
Oh no, is that it?
I guess it is, oh well.
Just make sure you guys tune in next time,
'cause "Lucky Channel's" gonna have a super special guest
coming by the studio!
See you guys later, okay?
Bye-ni!
Wasn't there an easier way to get rid of him?
I mean, we could've just shot him out of a--
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"...
I'm Nanako!
And I'm Yui-chan!
I don't know if you're like me,
but right before summer starts
don't you get all excited about it, sure you do!
But then before you know it, the summer's over
and nothing exciting's happened to you.
Hmm, I guess.
What's so special about summer anyway?
Yeah, well, it's not like you're going to find
true love with anyone you meet during summer
so whatever, right?
Hmm, yeah, I wouldn't know.
Who cares, we're still young!
Let's get out there and get some!
Yeah, wait, what?
No comment.
Next time, "Ways to Spend Summer."
I'm gonna get me some!
Senior year, Class B!
Miss Kuroi!
Yeah, yeah.
Good morning, guys, what's up?
Hey, you.
Good morning.
Wow, you remembered to wear your winter uniform.
Yeah, who'd you think I am, Tsukasa?
Ahh?
But it's still so darn hot out.
I wish we could stay in our summer uniforms a little longer.
I wish they'd let us pick when to switch
'cause it's still cold when they make us
change back to our summer uniforms.
Yeah.
I think the point of it is to
get us to change gears mentally.
Otherwise there'd be nothing but slackers like you guys.
So have you guys heard the stories about
how parents are checking their daughters'
cell phones and computers for sketchy emails?
Right, I've heard about that happening.
Does your dad check up on you that way?
Hmmm.
I doubt he'd do anything like that.
Yeah, I guess not.
Your dad loves you so much I bet
he'd never do anything to upset you.
Hmm, yeah, of course he does, but
don't forget, my dad uses a computer, too.
And he knows how embarrassing it is when
someone's been peeking in to his D: drive.
His D-- forget it.
Man, this summer was all filled up with
taking classes and homework and stuff.
The fireworks and Ariake were the only fun I had.
So you went to Comiket after all?
Comiket?
Yeah, you know it!
That's the reason why my wallet's all sad now.
Whenever you go, you hemorrhage cash.
How much did you spend this time?
If issues cost 1,000 yen each, then...
somewhere around 40,000 to 50,000 yen.
What the?
You know, you've got really warped ideas about money.
I hear what you're sayin' but there's a thing
in this world called fair market value.
Anything self-published is bound to be expensive.
I'm not not talking about that!
I'm talking about how you can even spend that kinda money!
What's up with the weather?
It's September but it's still so hot out.
Yeah, you're right, it is.
And it feels especially hot this year doesn't it?
Global warming is on everybody's mind.
Yu-chan gets heat stroke real easy
so she usually goes and hangs out in the living room
or wherever we got the AC crankin'.
Yeah, Tsukasa does the exact same thing,
but only because she's lazy.
Ahh!
You know, sometimes me and dad join her for a snooze.
And we end up lying on the floor
lookin' like the kanji for the word "small."
Wait, you mean you guys look like the kanji for "river"?
No, 'cause dad always plops
himself down between us like this.
That figures, looks like Yutaka-chan's
gotten used to living at your place.
Yoo-hoo, I'm here to hang out again!
What's up, Yutaka?
Doin' good?
Oh, hey, oneichan.
Hello, what's your name?
This is my friend, Minami Iwasaki.
Right on, you're Minami-chan, huh?
Yutaka's told me all about you!
Oneichan!
Knowing these two share
the same DNA makes me a little... envious.
Hmm?
Wow, I guess all those rumors I heard about
how pretty you are aren't rumors after all.
You're a little cutie pie, girl.
Want something to drink?
Yeah, beer!
But you can't, you drove over here.
No, I'm just kidding. Barley tea please.
Of course, one sister absorbs the traits of the other.
Absorbs.
Woah, it's Yasai Mosai!
Do you know what I can do to stay awake longer?
I get so sleepy when it's night.
Instead of forcing yourself to stay up late,
how about getting to bed early and waking up early?
You'd feel better.
Good idea, sis, I'll try it out.
I'll wake up early tomorrow and do my best.
How come I woke up the same time I always do?
I think I remember turning something off.
Even if I get up early I just end up
falling right back to sleep again out of habit.
You have to want to wake up early.
Maybe it's better if I just tried harder
to stay up late and kept studying.
I seriously doubt you're gonna get a whole lot done
if you're constantly rubbing sleep out of your eyes.
I got it, everyone else gets up early around here,
maybe you could ask mom to wake you up.
How 'bout it Mom?
Okay, I'll make sure to wake you up tomorrow morning.
This is totally gonna work and it's
all thanks to my super smart sis.
Mom, you were supposed to wake me up!
I did wake you up, you even answered me.
Wait, I did?
Don't you remember?
Oooh.
Huh, oh no, Konata forgot to take her lunch.
Ah, thank you.
It's kinda weird walking through the halls
of the senior class when you're just a freshman.
It feels like everybody's watching me.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Uh-huh, I bet everybody was checkin' Yui-chan out.
-I mean, just look at her. -Huh?
It doesn't matter if it's
the senior's hall or the freshman's.
If you're someplace you've never been before,
you get this weird vibe, kinda like
you're the center of attention or somethin'.
I'm gonna stand out no matter what 'cause I'm so short,
but I totally feel the pressure
when a bunch of seniors are staring.
You know what, I always like it
when I get that kinda attention.
Really? You're lucky.
Yeah, but nobody blinks an eye
when I go walkin' through the freshman halls.
They don't even realize I'm older than they are.
Hi, Patty-chan.
Oh, hey, guys, what's up?
Are you headin' off to work right now?
You know it.
I signed on for way too many shifts this week.
Are you guys still working together at the cafe?
Yep, believe it or not, we're
startin' to get pretty popular.
Yeah, the "A" boys get all moe-moe for us.
Hmm, what the heck's an "A" boy?
It's what you call boys who look like
they belong in Hakuba, you know the type.
Although Narimiya-kun wasn't who I had in mind for that part.
That girl has definitely gotten used to Japan.
Oh come on, because of that?
Woah, I just had a really cool idea!
I think I'll finish my bath first, then I'll sketch it up.
Uh.
Wait, what was it?
This always happens when I don't jot down my ideas
right away, and it was so funny!
What a day, what a day. I'm so tired.
That sounds like it could be funny.
I'll sketch it out when I get up in the morning.
It's so funny!
Oh, this sucks.
I wish I wrote it down instead of being so lazy.
It was such a good idea, too.
What was it?
Ha!
Ah! I woke up this time, but I still forgot.
Why can't I remember my dreams?
It was such an awesome idea.
"Lucky Star."
Okay, everybody, I'm leaving it up to you guys
to figure out who's staying with who.
We're going to Kyoto and Nara, so I want
you guys to research all the cool places.
But isn't the bus gonna be stopping
at all the cool places anyway?
Nah, the bus is gonna be stopping
at all the typical touristy spots. Dream on.
And there goes my comeback.
Woah!
Iris crashed through here.
About 1,300 years ago, Nara was the capital of Japan.
But then, in the year 710, the capital was
relocated to Heijo-kyo.
So please sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride
as I Nara-row down Nara's history for you.
"Nara-row down Nara"!
Is that supposed to be funny?
Thanks for waiting.
Hmm, if this dude's the main one,
then the little ones around him are all the options.
You ever hear of divine punishment?
Aw.
It's really sticky.
Ew, I'm all stinky now, too.
Come on girl, cookie.
Keep it up, shorty.
Please to snap-snap, okay?
Oh, what?
I bet he wants you to take a
picture of him and his buddies.
Oh, uh, okay, uh,
click-click, okay?
Here's where you find out
just how good a person studies.
Yeah, look who's talkin'.
Um, hey sis, do you know
how people from India say cheese?
Huh, cheese in Hindi.
Uh,
cheese in Hindi?
Ah ha, we're not so smart after all, are we?
Isn't English understood by the
majority of the population in India?
That's right, if you say cheese,
they'll know what you're talking about.
Okay, say cheese, everyone.
I heard that whenever there's a field trip
it's guaranteed that people are gonna start hookin' up.
That's probably why these things
are so popular with everyone.
Hmm, perhaps the fact that we're off campus together
creates an atmosphere where we
can feel more open to such things.
They think, "It's now or never."
It's kind of embarrassing, but if I don't
have my pillow, it's hard for me to get to sleep.
It's kind of embarrassing, but if I don't
have my clock, it's hard for me to get to sleep.
It's kind of embarrassing, but if I don't
fire this bad boy up at least once a day,
I can't get to sleep at night.
Okay, everyone, we'll be arriving
at Kiyomizu Temple any minute now.
Here's something you might find interesting,
the hill leading up to the temple is called Sannen-zaka.
And if you trip and fall here,
it's said you'll die in three years time.
The Sannen-zaka becomes the Zannen-zaka, get it?
- -
What if you die laughing?
Okay, people, we're gonna split up
into groups and go look around.
Have fun, but be careful of the traffic.
We're gonna meet up at 12:30 in front of
Chionin Temple, so make sure you're on time.
Or be late and when we get back
you'll have a 20 page report waiting for you.
I don't think we should.
Hey, come on guys, let's give it a shot.
I wonder if this is as heavy as Dragon Slayer.
Woah!
It's so high up.
They say do it like your willing to jump off the
Kiyomizu stage, so does that mean
that you shouldn't worry about the consequences?
'Cause if you really jumped off this thing you'd die.
Kagami, you're way too realistic.
Oh look, it's a god of romance.
Apparently this spot is
famous for bringing lovers together.
Yeah, I can see why.
Look, they're selling love fortunes!
Hey, let's all pick one.
Yeah, come on, let's do it.
Darn it, I can't see anything through the wrapper.
I think they do that on purpose.
This one!
Yes, a great blessing!
Good for you, Kona-chan, that's awesome.
Oh, mine just says fortunate.
A fortunate fortune's good enough.
I wonder what mine's gonna be.
What the heck is a half blessing?
Maybe it means that you're half-blessed.
Or maybe it means you're half-cursed.
Nobody takes these love fortunes seriously anyway.
Oh, how cute!
Ah, you picked a good one.
I don't know, Kagami, that's more your style.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, I guess I will buy this little guy.
Don't forget this, nom-nom-nom.
I'm not buying that.
How about this flavor?
No!
Watch out, you're gonna trip.
Hm.
This one says, "Konata's my wife."
'Kay, if y'all are ready, we'll get going.
And when we get back to the hotel, we can all have lunch.
Buckle up guys, we're off.
Ready when you are.
And, I heard Koizumi's song was sung the way IZAM--
ah, hey, Teach, someone's chasing us!
What?
This is just like what happened to me in Hokkaido!
Hey, sing "Maetel" for me!
That idiot's gonna give me 50 pages for this.
Hey, driver, could you please stop the bus for a second?
Later.
-Hmm? -
Yeah, right, hurry up.
How come Kinkaku temple is gold,
but Ginkaku temple isn't silver?
Apparently they wanted it to be mentioned
right along with Kinkaku, so they
named it "Gin" to complement "Kin."
It was never actually meant to be a silver temple.
I wonder if it's anything like how
they got Ruby and Sapphire Pokemon.
Didn't she hear me?
Nice shot.
I forgot to tell you our shrine was in the news.
Can you believe we only have one day left?
And it's our day off, so we're gonna have lots of fun.
Get ready, 'cause the real field trip begins tomorrow!
We're off to the Holy Land!
Yeah.
Huh?
Your note said in front of
the hotel so I figured this was okay.
I, I hope you
weren't waiting too long.
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?
Well, I, I don't know how to say this,
but I...
I was wondering if I could have that doll.
You want a doll?
Yeah, you know, it's the one that you bought
back at that shop in Kiyomizu temple.
The little Yatsuhashi doll.
Yatsuhashi-kun?
Right, that's him!
I'd love that little guy and I really want one but--
but I was afraid of what the guys would say
if they saw me buy it, so can I have yours?
Please!
Oh, sure.
Thanks a lot, Hiiragi! I owe you one, man, ha-ha!
Don't tell anyone about this, 'kay?
Later.
It won't open.
When the steam inside the bowl
cools down it creates a vacuum.
You just give the edge of the lid a little squeeze
to let some air in and voila, the lid comes off.
Oh.
Okay.
Wha!
I'm sorry!
Uh-huh, she's showin' off again.
I figured out the directions to get there.
And you're sure it's okay to go?
Oh, yeah, besides, we're just
looking at the building from the street.
I don't see why we have to go
to all this trouble just 'cause we're in Kyoto.
Tisk, tisk, tisk.
You still don't get the adventur-ious ways of the otaku.
And I don't ever wanna get it.
There's nothing even here.
That's a good thing, 'cause they
need to concentrate on their work.
Their building looks pretty normal.
It's perfect 'cause they keep
their focus on a small number of titles.
Did you have to come all the
way to Kyoto to buy that stuff?
No, that's embarrassing!
Come on, it'll be an awesome memory of today.
Yeah sis, I want a picture with you.
She's right, it'll be fun.
This is cool 'cause we got it in Kyoto.
But there's nothing Kyoto about it.
Yeah, we made it back safe and sound,
pretty fast too.
Tsukasa went right to sleep though.
I thought you'd be in bed too.
Ya know, sulking or something.
What makes you think I've got anything to sulk about?
Did you put that picture we took anywhere special?
No, it's totally embarrassing.
Totally embarrassing.
I worked my butt off this week,
and now that the class field trip's over
I got time to do some relaxing.
I'll just fire up my computer and spend
the weekend playin' games 'til my eyes bleed.
"Lucky Star."
"Lucky Channel"!
Hiya, Luckies! "Lucky Channel's" filling
up your lives with another episode!
And I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami.
And I'm her assistant, Daisuke Ono, at your service.
Can you believe it's our 21st episode?
That's true, we're getting close to the final episode.
So without further ado, our segment today is called
"This Week's Maggare."
Ugh! Is that...?
I brought back your water.
Sniff, sniff.
Blah!
What the hell is this?
It's warm, I'm not drinking that piss!
I'd rather get something from a vending machine.
Ahhh!
Do not mess with me!
Come here, you rotten-- I've been takin'
your crap for too long! No more!
You think everything's about you, don't ya?
Mi-- Minoru!
Well, today it's my turn, missy!
You got any idea what it's like for me workin' part-time
in CoCo Ichi, then coming here to do this thing?
Hell, least I make more there than I do as a voice actor.
I've been workin' there so long they wanna promote me.
Before I come here to kiss your ass, I'm fryin' cutlets.
Well, maybe that's what you should
be doing instead of acting.
You son of a-- all right, Ono, get out of my chair!
That's my spot and I want it back right now.
I'm sorry, didn't anyone tell you?
The producer and director said you were out.
Ahh!
Those guys didn't even give me a chance.
Well, I'll show them, I'm a late bloomer!
I bet I could turn into a star if I wanted!
You think you could, huh? Someone like you?
Wha, how dare you mock me.
I don't have to take this crap.
Not from and not from !
- -Fine, I quit.
I'm quitting this desk!
Ahh!
-"Luck Channel" my ass! -
Get the hell off of me!
What, you see something that you like?
You like that "Misoji Misaki" junk? You think it's funny?
Oh, I'm gonna be 30 soon, man.
Yeah, take it.
I see you standing there.
Come here you!
Welcome to Idaho!
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"...
Akira Kogami here!
Daisuke Ono here.
Okay, enough with the animal talk.
Oh, those were animals?
Next time, "The Yonder Here."
I can cross the finish line, right?
Ramen set!
Senior year, Class B!
Miss Kuroi!
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for that awesome meal.
You got it, I should take
you guys out more often.
That was really, real good.
Yeah, I know.
I get happy inside when the eggs
are yummy like that.
-Ah! -Huh?
Gas is two yen more today than it was yesterday.
I should have filled up when I had the chance.
Why do people who are generous
with their money care about gas prices going up a yen or two?
So, you know that book I let you borrow
the other day?
I heard they're turning it into a game now.
What do you think about that?
Geez, Kagami, that's old news.
I went and pre-ordered the limited edition
the second they announced it.
Then I bought the box set of the anime
and a bunch of other related stuff.
Wow, you got more hooked than me.
If someone recommends something,
the person they recommend it to
usually becomes a bigger fan than
the person doing the recommending.
That's how Yui-neisan bought her car.
No way.
Yup, right after I loaned her a manga
with a car racing theme.
When I found out, I was like, "Whoa."
Having a hobby can be a scary thing.
I guess last night makes three in a row, huh?
Yeah, talk about a miracle, right?
If they keep up this winning streak--
What's she talking about?
I think she's talking about professional baseball.
Apparently she's a fan.
And speaking of baseball,
I seem recall that the famous poet, Shiki Masaoka,
was quite fond of it.
In fact, I heard he played on the team as catcher
until tuberculosis forced him to stop.
He loved the game so much he took
his childhood nickname of Noboru
and changed it to "No-boru" which means "no ball."
Anyway, you said Japan Series just now
and I realized something.
In Major League Baseball,
don't they call the winning team world champions?
Yeah, well that's something that only applies
to North American teams.
I mean, if they wanna start talking world anything,
they should come over here and beat
our team sometime, you know.
She's really into baseball, isn't she?
It was totally stinky.
It was, wasn't it?
Oh, hey, I was looking all over for you guys.
Hey, Konata.
Can either of you show me how
to do this problem?
I can't believe you're asking about your studies.
Sure you don't wanna just copy it?
You know, looking at these problems,
some of them look very difficult.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, that's 'cause they're
for this quiz game I'm playing at the arcade.
I'm not too good at figuring out basic
academic questions.
Oh, boy, here we go again.
Maybe you should try studying some time.
Entrance exams are right around the corner.
This is the way I am when I'm at school,
but at the arcade they call me a sage.
Well then, go enroll yourself
in that whatever academy game of yours.
I wish I got more sleep last night.
Playing games all night, huh?
Hey, Miyuki-san, is it true that
you always go to sleep by 11:00?
Yes.
That's way too early.
Whoa!
Oh, I get it.
That's what flashed in my head when
I was looking at Miyuki-san,
but you get lots of sleep and you're still teeny-tiny.
Oh, can you believe she said that to me?
Like I needed that.
Hello, is this the Iwasaki residence?
Sorry to call so late,
my name's Yutaka Kobayakawa.
I'd like to speak with Minami-chan.
Oh, she's in bed already?
Does she always go to sleep this early?
♪ Pittan ♪
♪ La, la, mojipittan. ♪
Okay, that sounds like a happy little song.
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
No, it's okay.
Uh-huh,
right, I'll make sure my father knows about it.
I'll tell him right after
the ground-breaking ceremony, okay?
Yes, right after.
Oh, no, it's nothing like that, really.
Besides, I'm not even old enough yet,
so there's no way he'd let me.
Well, that's not how it is,
but thanks for saying so.
Okay, I'll let my dad know.
Okay, bye.
-You're funny. -Hmm?
They can't see those gestures you're making.
I know, I know, I can't help it.
So, what?
Whenever I'm on the phone talking to someone,
I have to stop playing my game
'cause I can't concentrate on the conversation.
But then my other hand starts getting lonely
'cause it's got nothing to do.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Anyway, I was on the phone the other day,
cleaning the floor with one of those roller thingys
that picks up lint and stuff,
and I just kept rolling and rolling.
And isn't it weird how if you're doing something
like that or if you're doodling,
you just keep doing it over and over?
Yeah, I guess so.
But the second you get off the phone,
you lose your motivation to keep cleaning.
And then you look around and you get all sad,
'cause the floor's only clean where you were sitting
and rollering.
You could just keep rollering.
My passion to keep cleaning ends with the conversation.
So you just give up.
That guy's super stinky, isn't he?
It's fine once in a while but--
Ha, ha, look, it's a pocky,
get it?
Come on, we used to do that back
in elementary school.
Seriously, that's a little kid thing you're doing there.
Ah, cute.
Anyway, do you guys remember some of the stuff
you used to do when you were young?
Like when you'd stir up your yogurt and yell,
"Bread factory."
"Bread factory"?
-Yeah, didn't you? -Hm-mmm.
So, yeah, "bread factory," huh?
Go on, say it,
come on, don't be shy.
Shut up, okay!
You know that game you borrowed a while ago?
I need it back 'cause someone else
wants to play it now.
Is that someone someone Shorty McBlue-Hair?
Yup, actually, I loaned a couple games to her too.
I should probably get those back.
You're something else, Hiiragi, you know that?
What do you mean?
I think it's cool you remember that stuff.
The other day, I found some games I borrowed
from someone, but now I can't remember
who it was.
You're kidding.
And there's a couple of games I loaned out
but I can't remember who's got 'em.
Sounds pretty careless.
Nuh-uh, it's a universal truth.
In fact, they call it the law of forgetting
the lender or something.
You made that up.
Hello, this is Kagami.
Hey, Hiiragi, it's me, Misao.
Oh, hey, how's it going?
Oh!
Dammit, I dropped it.
What the heck are you doing,
you okay?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I'm fine, no worries.
So, what's up, why'd you call?
Oh, yeah,
why did I call you?
How should I know?
It was something really important too.
Then don't forget it.
I just looked at the winning numbers
for the autumn jumbo lottery,
but I didn't win.
Guess getting the winning ticket's pretty rare.
I sent in a ton of postcards for something,
and I didn't win anything either.
I guess it sucks for both of us, huh?
But if it's this hard to win,
maybe its because the people who run these lotteries
and giveaways are cheating and don't want anyone to win.
It isn't nice to say things like that
about people, Konata.
I can't do this.
I should go to sleep.
I better go to the bathroom first.
They say I talk to myself too much,
but that doesn't matter at all.
Why did saying a dumb joke like that wake me up?
I was so sleepy before.
Oh, I'm done.
I don't have to use the bathroom
so I better hop into bed while I'm sleepy.
Cold!
I was so sleepy too.
Why does my futon have to be so cold
when I get in?
It totally woke me up.
Maybe 'cause it's warm tonight
I'll get to sleep faster.
Now my feet are hot and I can't get to sleep.
Why, why?
Does this stuff only happen to me?
Lucky Star.
Roasted sweet potatoes taste the best
this time of year.
Yeah, but you know, Kagami--
I already know what you're gonna say,
so don't say it, all right?
Here, you want some?
Thanks but no thanks,
that stuff makes you fat.
And she says it anyway.
Look, I couldn't help it, okay.
I made eye contact with the vendor.
I mean, you can't just walk away
without buying anything after that.
He looked at me like I was gonna hurt his feelings
if I didn't buy something.
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
At Comiket, it's hard to put the book down
after eye contact.
No one understands what you're talking about
and you don't really care, do you?
What do you mean?
That's what it's like when you're checking
out the tables in the artist alley.
If you pick up a book and the seller's
standing right in front of you,
you feel bad about going to another table
without buying it.
But in the end you don't buy it, do you?
They're turning a lot a light novels
into anime lately, aren't they?
Yeah, I noticed.
The one I let you borrow the other day
has been turned into an anime three times so far.
They're also gonna release a new volume soon.
Yeah, I saw the anime version of it,
but I still haven't gotten around to the book yet.
All those words kinda wear me out.
Here we go again.
Look, those games you play have way more words
in them, don't they?
Yeah, I guess so.
But wouldn't it be really awesome
if they released all those books as dating sims?
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
Hey!
Yeah, I know.
Anyway, I wonder when season four is gonna start.
Wait, what?
Is that like product placement or something?
Hey, Yu-chan,
you okay over there? You need some help?
It's this lid.
Every time I try to close it
it ends up crooked.
Oh, it's okay.
It's no big deal.
This kind of stuff happens to everybody.
But I keep doing it.
Here you go.
I think it's cute how you and Miyuki-san
have the whole clumsy thing going on.
You're so awesome, oneichan,
thanks a bunch for helping me out.
Oh, no, what do I do?
It won't open.
Uh, oh, my bad.
I'm always doing stuff like that.
I guess I don't know my own strength.
Is that bag giving you trouble?
Come on, hand it over.
Thanks, oneichan, you're the best.
Hey, what the--
open!
Rotten bag.
Why don't you try tearing from
the jaggedy edge of the bag?
Hang on, I'm gonna open this thing up proper or else!
Fire.
Hey, oneichan,
maybe you should use a pair of scissors on it.
No!
If I use scissors, it'd be like
I let this thing beat me or something!
Is that a mosquito?
Yup.
Even if it hasn't launched a full on attack,
it pisses me off just knowing it's around here somewhere.
But now that I know it's here,
I'm gonna make sure it goes down hard.
Look out, my hunter instinct's about to kick in.
Hey, Dad, wanna know what I was just thinking?
If Yu-chan was asked out by a guy from her class
and I was asked out by a guy from my class,
does that mean those guys have lolita complexes?
Oh, boy.
I guess if the guy's in the same grade as you,
it's safe to say he doesn't have one.
Then again, both you girls look younger
than you really are,
so I guess there's that.
Hmm. If a girl's 30 years old,
but she looks like she's in elementary school,
if that's the case,
you could say the guy prefers older women.
That's a good question, hun.
I don't know if there's an easy answer for it, though.
It's so cool I can ask you stuff like that.
If I ask Kagami, she'd say something like,
"I don't care."
How about you, Dad,
-are you like that? -Hmm?
Well, you loved Mom and she looked young,
and I know you love having me for a daughter.
Does that mean you have a lolita complex?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not exactly what your old man's about.
I also have a lolita complex is a better way of putting it.
I mean, sure I like young girls,
but I also like normal girls,
I don't discriminate.
Either way, that's still pretty creepy, Dad.
Look, you've always been super clingy with me,
but I was wondering if I was a boy
instead of a girl,
would you still be all clingy with me?
Yeah, sure, of course I would.
I totally get where you're coming from.
I bet you're glad I turned out to be a girl.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Yu-chan, I know you wanted to take a bath,
so how about you go first, okay?
Thanks, I won't take long.
He's feeling weird about her hearing this.
-Hey, Dad, you know what? -Hmm?
I've been thinking about Mom,
how she knew you all her life
and how she was petite and stuff,
she was kinda like a character in a dating sim.
When she was a little kid, Kanata sure
was a cutie pie.
I know you were always head over heels in love with her,
but I was wondering,
why did she wanna marry you?
Well, I made her feel guilty.
I told her it was her fault I turned into
a dating sim-loving maniac
'cause she always ignored me.
I'm being serious, Dad.
But it's the truth.
You guilted her into marrying you?
No, of course not, I'm kidding, honey,
you know that.
But when you were born, your mom and me
were the happiest people in the world.
Her little mole looks just like yours.
Yeah, but she's got your eyes, Kanata,
no doubt about it.
She's our daughter.
I'm worried, though.
I hope she doesn't grow up to be like
either of us.
I don't want her to be short like me
or a raving geek like you.
Thanks a lot, honey.
What got your thinking about your mom all of a sudden?
Well, I guess I just don't know
all that much about her, that's all.
Konata,
are you lonely 'cause your mother's not around?
No, not really.
I mean, Yu-chan's here now
and you can be such a spaz,
it's almost like having two people around.
I guess.
You see her, Kanata,
she turned out pretty good, hasn't she?
She might not be as normal as you wanted,
but she's a good girl.
-Hey, Konata? -Hmm?
You gotta promise me something, honey bunny,
don't die before I do, okay?
Okay, I wasn't really planning on it or anything.
Thanks, kid.
Kanata was really young when she passed away.
She was laughing and talking about how happy
she was right up to the end,
I get sad sometimes thinking about her.
But when my time comes, I hope I go out like that.
What are you talking about, Dad?
You wanna die laughing?
Mmm, I wanna get moed to death.
Come on, be serious, Dad,
or you're never gonna die a proper death.
I'm kidding.
Anyway, I bought a new camera for work today.
You wanna help me test it out?
Ah.
It's been so long since I was here.
No, Dad, stop.
I wonder what they're up to.
Sounds like they're having fun.
Say cheese!
Dad, you said...
Cool, get ready for another.
Come on, dad, you got enough shots
and you're hanging all over me.
Aw, come on, honey,
what's the big deal?
I just wanna get a few pictures of us
with my new camera.
I thought you said you got it for work.
Aw, come on, don't--
You're the same as always.
You still like making people do everything
you wanna do, even if they don't.
Why are you being so mean to me, Konata?
-Hyah! -Whoa!
He hasn't changed a bit, has he?
You know something,
whenever I hug you, you feel just like
how Kanata felt,
and I really like it.
You shouldn't say
creepy things like that, ever!
I bet Mom had her hands full with you.
What do you mean?
Yeah, sort of.
But your dad's a good person,
so listen to what he says, okay?
Oh, you know that game you were playing
the other day?
After you figure it out,
you think you could tell me how to finish it?
Sure, you got it.
That thing is way harder than I thought
it was gonna be.
It's nice to see that they play games together.
I guess they're doing okay after all.
I can't get to the sex scene of this one character--
Whoa!
What kind of games are you playing
with our daughter anyway?
Oh, boy, I hope she's okay.
You better not be teaching her anything bad, So-kun.
Hey,
why do you think Mom chose to marry you anyway?
Huh?
I mean, you're a pervy old geek
with a lolita complex,
why would anyone pick you?
I can't believe you said that.
I think pervy old geek is a little bit harsh.
Super harsh.
Anyway, let's get back to your mom.
She's right, though.
You were always like this.
And sometimes I almost forget
why you were the one...
And I was a loser.
...I wanted to be with.
There was one thing I was absolutely sure of.
Huh?
Why'd you stop?
What was it?
What were you so sure of?
Hmm?
I was sure that no one else could ever love Kanata
as much as I did.
Oh,
there it is.
Yeah, that's it.
You can't beat that.
He accepts all the good in me,
along with all the bad.
He shares everything with me,
the good,
and the bad.
I felt so safe and happy with you.
It was the only place
I ever felt so safe and happy.
Know what I mean?
Since we're in such a good mood now,
I think this calls for a picture.
I feel kind of sad I can't
be there with the two of you right now.
Well, yeah.
Geez, Dad, that camera's not for work, is it?
Man.
What?
I'm just trying to get used to it.
I don't wanna be figuring this out
when I'm on assignment.
But,
you and Konata are always with me.
And as long as the two of you keep
me alive inside your hearts,
we'll always be together.
Look, it's flashing, it's flashing.
You gave me so much happiness.
-May your lives be blessed... -Here it comes!
...with as much joy as mine was.
Cheese.
I wonder what they'll say.
Ah! Dad, look at
-this picture! -Hmm?
Ah!
Whose shadow is that in the background?
I think it's a ghost.
Huh, what?
Okay, I'm all done.
-Yu-chan! -Wait!
Look at this picture!
What-- what's wrong?
We gotta delete it,
it's cursed.
Quick delete it!
No, stop, don't delete it!
No deleting it won't work,
we have to burn it in a holy bonfire!
Don't you dare burn that camera!
After talking to her a bit more and stuff,
I can see she's not the person
I thought she was.
But Minamin is still pretty darn scary.
She's not scary, she's sweet.
Oh, look there she is.
Hi, Minami-chan.
Hi, Yutaka.
Wow, those two sure are close.
Yeah, close.
Yutaka, your tie is crooked.
Oh, onee-sama.
Ah!
I'm fantasizing about my friends again.
Oh, God, I'm all pent up!
Hmm?
"Lucky Star."
In three, two, one, we're live.
Well, where are they?
What do you mean they're gone?
Where the hell are they?
Call their managers!
Whatever, they're all getting fired.
Never liked that stupid show anyway.
We're live.
I knew something like this would happen.
Hey!
You know I turned this gig down.
Yeah, turned it down.
But I had to do it anyway.
Politics, man,
gotta be grown up about it.
Hey!
We're rolling.
Huh, what's rolling?
Me, you, the Earth?
No, we're rolling!
The camera's rolling!
Holy crap!
Cut, cut!
One, two, three, four.
- -
- -
On the next episode of Lucky Star.
Soujiro here.
Kanata here.
Well, So-kun, I better get going.
-You're leaving now? -Mm-hmm.
Take me with you.
I know I can't separate my spirit from my body,
but I can learn.
So-kun, if you're going to talk
about anime and manga, I'm leaving.
Bye.
No, Kanata!
Next time, "Delicate Line."
So-kun, I can't fly well
in all this turbulence!
Oh, brother.
Senior Year, Class B?
Ms. Kuroi!
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Konata, can I borrow your computer for a second?
I just remembered about this committee meeting
that's coming up, and I need to write something for it.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, I have been feeling a little out of whack lately.
But I think I'll be ready on time.
I'd like to get a bigger head start...
but I don't want to rush it,
because I want to make sure everybody is
feeling comfortable with it.
And I'd like it if we could work out all the details
of the assignment.
Yeah, so are you gonna tell me what's going on
with your computer, or what?
Hah hah! Maybe other people's computers are just too hard
for you to deal with, Kagami.
Whoa!
I didn't check my email for a couple of days,
and now my inbox is megas full!
You get email?
I never pictured you as being all that popular.
Okay.
It's called your inner voice for a reason.
You gotta keep it inside.
A good 90% of my emails are phisher spam.
I bet it's because of all the sketchy sites I visit.
I'm pretty sure you shouldn't admit that to a cop.
In fact, I'm positive.
Isn't it amazing how these guys always come up
with the funniest things to put in the subject line?
I mean, some of this stuff's hilarious.
Yeah, I know.
Wow, it's copying pretty fast.
Looks like it'll be done before I know it.
Huh.
Ugh! How can anyone rely on what the timer says
when it goes up and down like that! Jeez!
Late night snacking calls for a bowl
of instant ramen, baby.
How could you tease me like that?
Hey there!
Ooh, thanks.
Is it true that Konata and Yutaka both caught a cold?
Uh-oh. Hey, Yutaka. How you doing?
I haven't had a cold in awhile.
Hi, Konata! How you feeling?
What's up, Neisan? How's it going?
Uh-huh.
Funny how you don't have the energy to go to school,
but you've got enough to play your games.
Uh, yeah, well you see--
aw, you know how it is, don't ya?
Hello!
Wow, thanks for coming by to visit, Minami,
and thanks for bringing your friends along, too.
That darn cold really nailed her,
but I gotta say I've never seen her
as healthy as she's been lately.
Thanks a lot for being there for her, Minami-chan.
Oh, it's okay, really.
Back in Junior High,
Yutaka had maybe one or two good friends,
so I guess you must be really special to her.
She just can't stop talking about you, Minami-chan.
And I've never seen her have this much fun
at school before, either.
You know how when you're sick
people say it's all in your head?
Well, when you're busy having fun,
you don't have time to think about being sick.
Hello!
Wow, thanks for coming by to visit, Minami,
and thanks for bringing your friends along, too.
That darn cold really nailed her,
but I've gotta say that I've never seen her
as healthy as she's been lately.
Thanks a lot for being there for her, Minami-chan.
Oh, it's okay, really.
Back in Junior High,
Yutaka had maybe one or two good friends,
so I guess you must be really special to her.
She just can't stop talking about you, Minami-chan.
- -I've never seen her have
this much fun at school before, either.
Minami-chan, Tamura-san, Patty-chan, please come in.
How are you feeling?
Promise me you'll get well soon, okay?
Uh-huh, I just wish I wasn't all weak and frail,
because I hate being sick.
I feel bad for making everyone worry.
No way! Being weak and frail like that
is a great way to get people to make a fuss over you.
Yeah, well, it might look like fun
to someone who isn't weak and frail,
but if you're weak and frail, it probably sucks.
Hmm, I guess that's like saying
how if you've got a little sister in real life,
you probably won't think little sisters are moe.
Yeah! That's right.
Whoa! Watch out, the normal people are attacking us
with weird looks!
I'm being blinded by their aura of confusion!
We can't help that we're different!
We're outlaws in an ordinary world!
Speaking of things we wish were different about ourselves,
Minami-chan wishes she had bigger boobs.
- -Wow, is that for real?
No, it's not like that.
I heard that if you massaged
your boobs, they get bigger.
Yeah, I heard that too.
Are you sure it's okay, Minami-chan?
Yes, I'm positive.
You're the only person I could ever ask, Yutaka.
Okay, here goes.
Oh, easy, girl! Get a hold of yourself.
Wow, that's cool, Tamura-san.
I didn't know you were from that circle.
Yeah, and I had stuff at last summer's Comiket.
I bought a couple of your books.
They're good.
Oh, thanks a lot.
That's so cool.
I'd love to read some of the manga you've drawn, Tamura-san.
Will you let me borrow yours?
Sure, I'll go get--
Please, you don't want to do that.
Come on, Hiyorin, don't you want everyone
to experience the doujin you worked so hard on?
You don't understand.
That stuff's not for the general market.
Have mercy.
Oh, Hiyorin, just give it up already.
Isn't that amazing?
Now, let's review.
Chewing gum containing xylitol
has been proven to destroy the germs that cause cavities,
because when the xylitol is absorbed by the germs
that cause cavities, it depletes the ATP
in the bacteria and also it dissolves the cavity itself.
And...
If it's really that good for my teeth,
I should try it.
I was chewing the gum because it was good for my teeth,
but it made me lose a filling,
so I had to go to the dentist.
A pitiful and unlucky Miyuki-san is moe.
So that's what poor, sweet Miyuki-san
was crying about today.
-Yeah? -Oh yeah.
Oh, um, okay.
That's what Onee-chan said happened to her.
So that's why Miyuki-san seemed so gloomy.
Um, I'm really sorry about what happened to Miyuki-san,
but that's great material!
This sucks, it's been forever since I've had a good idea.
How do you come up with ideas for manga anyway?
Hmm. I don't have any surefire method or anything,
but I usually get ideas
-from real life and stuff. -
From real life, huh?
You read them, didn't you?
Well, that depends on--
Admit it, you did!
Well, I--
She showed you, even after all that begging.
Um, I'm sorry.
Those stories weren't from real life.
Anyway, I thought the stories were good
and really fun to read.
Right, thanks a lot.
And there were a few that felt like they happened to me.
I got a feeling of deja vu while reading them.
I'd like to read some of her stories too.
I bet those stories were based on you guys!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Huh?
Oh, hey, how's it going, ma'am? Good morning.
Up all night playing games again?
Or maybe you did some late-night anime watching?
You know it, and these days there's tons more anime series
on late at night. Yeah, that rules.
Okay, you could at least lie
and tell me you were studying.
I've been seriously thinking about splurging
on a DVD recorder or something.
That might help.
Save your money. Why bother?
You'll record the shows and never get around to 'em.
Kinda like how your games pile up.
Huh? What are you talking about?
Whoa, hang on a second. You've gotta be kidding.
Yeah, right, you wish.
Listen, I don't have anything to do with any of it.
Uh...
Hey, it's me.
Did you just hang up on me?
I guess we got disconnected.
Yeah, I had three bars.
Anyway, I was acting immature a minute ago.
Sorry.
No, I didn't hang up on you.
That's not why.
I can't believe I'm back for another visit.
Let's have ourselves a peek inside, shall we?
Not to worry. We just need to pop the filling back in,
and you'll be as right as rain.
Now, about that tooth in the back.
I believe I've detected some decay.
We should start treatment immediately.
"Lucky Star."
-Oh. -Hmm?
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing, sis.
I just kind of realized how much strawberries smell
like shortcakes is all.
I get it. You meant to say that shortcakes
smell like strawberries, right?
You know, because they have strawberries inside them.
Huh?
I guess.
It's okay. It's not like getting confused
like that's a bad thing.
Good morning, everybody.
I hope you slept well.
-Hey, Yu-chan. Good morning. -Good morning.
Here's today's pooch!
Wow, look at all the animals.
They're doing some kind of special about pets.
First, I'd like to introduce you
to a Welsh Corgi named Koo!
Wow, it's a corgi!
He's super cute.
I don't know about the dog,
but the owner is pretty darn cute.
And her thigh-high socks get extra points.
There's just enough skin showing between them and her skirt.
She'd look awesome in a Gothic maid ensemble.
Next we have Sylviana,
-a Siberian husky. -
Look, a husky. I like huskies a lot.
I wonder why you don't see them that much nowadays.
Whoa! Tsundere! Now that's what I'm talking about.
Moe-tastic.
Anybody who likes to walk around with their hair
in ponytails is definitely tsundere.
Wow, I didn't know you were into playing games and stuff.
Yeah, but I suck big time at 'em.
You want to play or something?
You're awesome, Hiiragi.
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo! I can't believe you did that.
Did you see that? Isn't Hiiragi amazing?
Yeah, she is.
Watching her have so much fun
makes me feel like a loser,
because all I care about's winning.
That's a ton of stinky.
Can something stinky be moe?
Oh, hey there, Patricia-san.
How's it going?
We're seeing you a lot
on this side of the school these days.
Well, Patty's really enthusiastic about learning.
In fact, you could say I've taken her under my wing.
I'm teaching her everything she needs to know
about the essence of Japanese culture.
Yeah, whatever, if you're teaching her,
she's only gonna be learning
about a sub-culture, if anything.
But otaku are the pride of Japanese culture.
-Mm-hmm. -I'm on a mission to absorb
everything I can here,
take it all back to America
and distribute it to the faithful.
You're right about one thing,
she is enthusiastic.
Anyway, what about music, Patricia-san?
Do you have any favorite bands that you like?
Hmm, let me see.
-There's Orange Range... -
...Chemist, Suneohair, Porno Graffitti,
L'Arc-en-Ciel, DEEN, Nightmare, and a bunch of others.
I listen to all kinds of different Japanese bands.
Wow, you sure do.
That's impressive, but all the bands you just named
sing anime songs.
Wow! Good one, Konita! You're so sharp.
And you're only listening to the songs
they did for anime, right?
Ah! You know, I really need to get myself a maid.
-Huh? -It'd be nice to get a maid.
Yeah, I guess that would be nice.
I heard you don't live in a dorm,
but you have a place all to yourself.
Yep, and the cooking, laundry, manga,
and anime keep me busy.
I bet it's hard, especially if you're not used to it.
No wonder you want to get yourself a housekeeper.
Oh no, I don't want to get a housekeeper.
I want to get a maid.
I didn't even know there was a difference.
What? You're kidding, right?
They're totally different.
Hasn't this country taught you anything?
Actually, I think you might
be getting the wrong idea about Japan.
No, I'm sorry, girl, I can't.
Fried food's a no-no.
She knows you'll give in, Minami.
that's why she isn't going away.
I'll take care of her, hon.
Come on, I've got something for you.
Slow down, girl.
But, now I feel so lonely.
Everybody in our class thinks she's too quiet
and really scary,
but the truth is that she's super-kind,
totally awesome, and really cool!
You know her, she's the one staying over
at Izumi-san's house.
She just admires her so much.
Oh, does she now?
Minami-chan, would you take this?
I have to agree, she is rather awesome and cool,
isn't she?
Yes, why even Izumi-san thinks so.
Minami-chan always gives off this cool-headed,
Little Miss Perfect vibe.
But when she's with Yu-chan, you can tell
that she is really a good human being.
And that's what she said about her.
Oh, I'm sorry, because it's on sale,
we have to limit it to only one per customer.
- -Oh, my.
She's cool-headed and a Little Miss Perfect.
And here's what Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san
have to say about her.
Minami-chan seems like the type who does everything
quickly, efficiently, and perfectly.
I think Minami-chan is awesome, because she seems
like she can do anything.
I wish I could be like her.
Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san speak so highly of Minami-chan.
I think it's wonderful that everyone admires her.
Yeah, but, Mom, I can't
because it's limited to one per customer.
Huh? Oh. Mm-hmm.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
She does everything quickly, efficiently, and perfectly.
-Hey, you. -Hey, girl.
Hey, what's up?
Whatcha watching there?
It's just some mecha anime series I rented.
This looks really cool.
You sure are into this stuff, aren't you?
Mmm. Yeah, but I'm not really
that much into mecha or anything.
What?
What do you mean you're not into mecha?
Why the heck are you watching the show then?
In order to attract a broader audience,
the creators of these mecha series are tossing in
a lot more cute boy and girl characters.
Pretty clever, huh?
What's the point in calling it mecha anymore?
Got that, Hiiragi? I'm counting on you for real,
so promise me.
I want to hear you say it. Go on, say it.
Yeah, sure, relax, I'll take care of it.
Come on, Misa-chan, you heard her.
She said she'd take care of it.
-Huh? -I wouldn't bother her
too much if I were you.
If there's one thing I've learned about people,
it's this-- whenever somebody says,
"Sure, I'll take care of it,"
chances are they're not gonna take care of nothing.
She picks the weirdest things
to be right about.
Kagami-sama!
Do you wanna go with me to Gamers today?
I got stuff to do today.
And besides, there isn't anything I want to buy.
Oh, come on, man.
It's not gonna take that long, I promise.
-No thanks. -Yes thanks.
Leave 'em alone.
Why do you always go to Gamers, anyway?
Isn't there a bookstore by your house you can go to?
Once you've been inside a specialty store like Gamers,
ordinary bookstores don't seem like they got you covered.
I mean good luck finding all the things you're looking for.
It's probably because all the things
you're looking for are too weird.
Okay, what are you gonna get?
Just this. I'm good to go.
You're watching that one too?
Oh no, I haven't seen the anime,
but when I saw the cover,
I couldn't help but think that I needed to get it.
Like we were somehow connected.
I couldn't fight this feeling no matter how hard I try.
You're talking crazy.
I finally figured out the philosophy behind the reason
why people buy stuff based on the cover art.
For example, you picked the light novels you read
based on the art, right?
Yeah, you're right. You got me there.
So, when you buy a book on a whim
and it turns out to be good, you think you totally scored.
And even if it turns out that the book you bought sucks,
you don't care 'cause you bought it on a whim.
Either way, it's a once- in-a-lifetime opportunity.
That's a good way of putting it,
and I totally see where you're coming from, but I don't buy it.
- -Huh?
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, huh?
Achoo!
That was a big one.
You might want to cover your mouth next time.
Well, you know it's not like you can control your sneezes.
I've never actually seen anyone go "achoo"
when they sneezed. That was hilarious.
Achoo!
Even with a sneeze,
the difference between us is huge.
It's not fair!
You're so darn cute, it's totally unfair!
Whoa, down, girl.
So, if you go all the way around, it doesn't stink so bad.
Is it true they stopped doing it?
You know, you guys get along great.
Hmm?
Do you guys ever argue or anything?
All the time.
She looks all sweet and mellow, but if you piss her off,
-she'll cut you, man. -
Yeah, I guess there's some people out there
-who are like that. -Oh, come on, leave me alone.
That reminds me, even when you're not mad, you're scary.
Darn it, I should have known
I was getting set up for something like that.
We just found out that Minami-chan got the same time
as you in the hundred-meter dash.
Oh yeah, that's awesome.
Although, if we ever had a race, I'd totally beat her
because of my boobs.
You want to try it?
Well, yeah, but she could still win
because of her height, right?
Can't she?
Wow, she totally ignored me, didn't she?
Hey, don't you think so too, Hiiragi?
Isn't that the funniest thing ever, Hiiragi?
Mmm.
Know what I'm talking about, Hiiragi?
Mmm.
Misa-chan's attitude is
"Answer me when I'm speaking to you,"
and Hiiragi-chan's is "Don't bother me, I'm reading."
Things are starting to get pretty tense around here.
I think it's so awesome how the characters
in anime and games have all this moe built into them.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, is that right or is the image corrupted?
Nah, it's supposed to look all blurry
and pixelated like that.
Oh, I kinda like how it's blurry and pixelated.
-Ahem! -
So, what kind of game are you underage
high school chicks playing, huh?
- -What's everybody doing here?
It's none of your business, Yu-chan!
That's all she wrote.
It's been forever since I updated the blog
with a big old entry.
I just gotta publish it and...
Ah! No!
Back, back, go back!
"Lucky Star."
Okay, I ain't your mom, so I'm not gonna waste my breath
giving you jerks a scolding today.
Gloomy.
And I don't even care about how we all ended up here.
You guys still with me?
Fantastic.
Anyway, I heard you losers built this show up
from nothing, yeah?
So now that you made it to the last couple
of episodes, you geniuses think
you're gonna bust the place down?
Unhappy.
People say I'm a mean bastard,
and you know I've done things
that'd make your hair turn white.
But this is the first time I've been called in
to stop a boring-ass argument!
-You awake? Good boy. -
If we don't get this thing resolved right freaking now,
it's gonna make me look bad.
And we don't want that, do we, Shiraishi?
-No, we don't, Gottoza-sama. -Huh? Do we?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.
Hmm.
You're awfully quiet.
-I'm so very sorry. -Huh?
I'm so very sorry, Gottoza-sama.
All right, you guys,
how's about we wrap this thing up for today?
Okay? Come here, you freak.
You got one more episode of "Lucky Channel,"
so go out and make it awesome.
'Kay? We good now?
Yes, ma'am.
I can't hear you!
Yes, ma'am, we're good!
And now that we got that settled,
ball's in your court now. Don't screw it up.
Keep your noses clean
and maybe you guys'll get somewhere in this industry.
Well, I guess I'm gonna be heading out now.
I'll let the producer know about our little talk,
and about how good you were.
Gimme a shout if you guys need anything,
and I'll send a couple of my boys down
to give y'all a hand.
- -Vroom. Vroom, vroom.
Vroom, vroom.
- -
On the next episode of "Lucky Star"...
Come on, everybody!
There's only one more episode, so let's do this right.
Hello? You guys listening?
Fine, whatever. I'll just do it by myself, then.
Next time, "To Be Decided."
No way! They haven't decided?
The arts festival's here.
Can you guys believe
it's that time again?
Time for exams too.
The second trimester's always a pain
'cause there's too much stuff to do.
This is our last arts festival in high school
and you're gonna whine about something like that?
That sign says, "Opening Ceremony."
Do you guys know what that's about?
It's a tradition for the school's Outou Festival.
A group of volunteers has to come up with the opening act
and perform it.
- -
I just had an awesome idea!
All right. I guess it's unanimous.
We'll have a room where people can get their fortunes told.
So before next homeroom everyone needs to decide
what type of fortunes they want to tell.
- -I'm so touched.
You did your best.
Here's my idea.
We all dress up like cheerleaders and do a dance.
For what?
For the Opening Ceremony of the festival.
That's what.
It's the perfect thing to do if you want to get a lot
of people in the mood to have some fun.
Yeah, it's over the top, but it's kinda cool.
I know!
And everyone here's gonna love the show we put on!
-Uh... -When you said we-- wait.
Ah! Don't tell me you've already signed us up for it.
When I asked the teacher,
I was told I had to turn in a proposal
along with a list of all the wonderful people
-who were gonna help. -
Huh? Ohh.
Oh.
So, how about it, Yutaka?
Oh, I...
But, Yu-chan, wouldn't it be a little too physical for you?
-Maybe. Or maybe not. -
If it isn't any trouble, I think I'd like to try it.
-I think. -It's no trouble.
None of us could imagine doing it without you,
so welcome to the team!
Are you sure about this?
It sounds like it's gonna be a lot of work and stuff,
and I don't wanna slow anyone down or anything.
But I think it could be a really good challenge for me.
Yay! Don't worry about a thing, Yutaka.
You're gonna be great!
So how about it, guys? You in?
Uh...
Okay then, count me in.
Yeah. I guess if you're all gonna do it--
You guys are the best! You're awesome!
Really? Fortune-telling?
Here's a question.
Do you even know how to tell a fortune?
Hm-mmm. Not at all.
-Ugh! -For real?
Jeez, wasn't it your idea?
It's an arts festival.
You don't have to be 100% accurate or anything.
Oh! Hey, Sis, what's your class
gonna be doing for the arts festival?
Well, we're sorta doing the typical haunted house thing.
Cool.
Hmm. How typical.
Well, no one in class came up with anything better, so.
Yeah, what?
Oh, nothing.
Sounds perfect if you ask me.
What's that supposed to mean?
Whoa! Don't get the monster angry!
I totally knew you'd say that.
Patty-chan told us she wanted to do
a cheerleading routine.
Yeah?
And then, I thought it might be fun
if I tried helping out too.
Yeah?
Wait, why now?
I guess I've been absent from school so much
and I never had the chance to work on any class projects.
But lately, I've been feeling a lot better.
And I've always wanted to do something fun like this,
and Patty-chan needs the help.
So, maybe it's a sign I should do it or something.
Hmm. I don't know.
It sounds like it could be tough for you.
I know it does.
So Patty-chan was wondering if you'd help out.
If you were there, I know I'd feel better.
Please, please, please.
I don't know about this.
But you're really athletic and everything.
And if you and Minami-chan are both there,
I know it would help me do the best I can and keep me going.
You really want me there and Patty's asking too.
Oh, I gotta think about this.
- -Huh?
Izumi residence.
Good evening, Konata.
Oh, hey, Patty.
I just found out about that thing,
but I don't know if I'm the right--
♪ Bum, bum, bum, bum! ♪
Time for a little quiz!
Right now I'm holding in my hand
a certain ticket to something.
Can you tell me what upcoming event this ticket's for?
Hmm.
Wait, you're kidding!
Oh, Konata.
I heard you loved her last concert.
Don't you want to shake Haruhi's hand?
I know you do.
Yes, I wanna shake her hand! I do, I do, I do!
I wanna go! I wanna see Aya!
Well, what were you gonna say
before I interrupted you?
Huh?
-Yu-chan? -Huh?
Okay, count me in!
Let's go have some fun!
Oh, okay.
So, anyway,
if you aren't a cheerleader, then you're not cool.
What are you talking about?
Patty was thinking about putting together
a cheerleading routine for the opening act
of the arts festival.
Oh yeah, I can totally see her doing that.
I know. And it's been decided
you and Tsukasa are doing it, too.
Huh?
Oh! Can you think of anyone else in your class
who might be good at cheerleading?
-Whoa, hang on a sec! -
Could you at least give us a minute to think about it?
I don't even think I can do anything like that.
What?
Come on, you'll never get another chance to do this.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
Hmm.
Wouldn't it be fun to do something like this
with all your friends? At a festival?
I mean, the more the merrier, right?
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, count me in.
- -
You're a total pushover, you know that?
Sorry, but I can't.
I got a ton of stuff to do for my class.
It's our last arts festival together
and I just wanted us to all be together having fun!
Why do you always pull out the friend card
when you want something?
I know you're faking, so stop it!
- -
Yu-chan even volunteered
and she's really excited about it.
She did? Is she gonna be okay up there?
I tried to get her to change her mind,
but I couldn't talk her out of it.
She's totally excited about the idea
and said how important it is for her to do something
special with everyone.
-Oh, really? -Really.
But they're having a hard time finding people to help out.
That's why they came to us to see if we wanted to do it.
I guess I might have been too pushy a minute ago.
That was totally unfair
and I don't blame you for not wanting to help us.
I'll do it.
Huh? Wait, you what?
I'll do it! I said I'll do it, okay?
- -Really, Sis?
Really, you will?
You need the extra help
and my class can always find someone to replace me.
It's not like I had a choice.
Kagami's so cute
when she acts like that.
Ch-- cheerleading?
I honestly don't think I'd be very good at it.
Well, I'm still not sure if we've got
everything we need to pull this off.
Especially in the volume department.
But I know that if you were with us jumping around on stage,
we'd be looking fine.
You really think so?
Oh, all right.
If you think I can help, I'd love to give it a shot.
Oh, awesome!
You're the breas-- uh... thank you.
Seeing how you all survived your exams,
it's time to get out there
and start preparing for the arts festival.
And there's no slacking off, or else.
Great.
It'd be nice if they'd ease up on the tests
when we've got all these events happening.
-Hey, what's up? -Huh?
What's happening with the cheerleading?
'Cause I haven't heard anything yet.
Does anyone even know?
Patty was saying...
Hey, they approved our idea!
...before exams started.
But I haven't heard anything since.
Well, that figures. Does anyone realize we need to practice
if we're gonna do this thing?
Do we even have time to practice?
I don't know, ask her.
Sorry.
I haven't had the chance to figure out the choreography yet.
You gotta be kidding me. What are we gonna do?
No, wait! It took longer than I thought it would
to find the right song.
It didn't help that I was looking for something
-with a "Hare Hare" feel. -Yeah, whatever.
Look, if you were having trouble with something
you could have asked for some help
instead of keeping it to yourself.
This cheerleader thing was your idea,
so it's your responsibility to organize it.
I can't hear you.
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la. ♪
Don't play that game with me!
Suck it up and get to work!
If we're gonna do this thing,
we need to get organized right now!
Miyuki and I are gonna find a place to practice
and we'll let everyone know when and where to meet up later.
You better have some of the moves figured out by then.
Don't worry about the rough spots,
we'll fix those in rehearsal.
And next time you need help, ask somebody!
-Uh, yeah. So, Kagamin. -What?
A little while ago you didn't sound
like you wanted to help out.
So how come you're all gung-ho about it now?
Shut up!
What's your thing gonna be, Miyuki-san?
I'm going to tell fortunes with tarot cards.
- -And what's yours?
Uh, I haven't decided what I'm doing yet.
Is there a kind of fortune-telling that's so simple
even I could do it?
Let me see.
Perhaps you could give shape readings to people?
The shapes tell me something about
how your love life is gonna be awesome
or something like that, I think.
Tsukasa, you don't know what you're talking about,
-do you? -What-- what the heck?
You-- you're kidding me.
We're supposed to learn how to do that?
Don't you think it's cool?
It's not that we don't like it...
But it looks very difficult.
Well, since we're out of time, we're just gonna have to
simplify the really hard moves while we're practicing.
-That's all we can do. -We're so gonna die.
But if we pull this off,
it'll be the most emotional moment of our lives!
Put a sock in it!
Uh-oh, we ran out of masking tape.
I needed a break anyway.
Come on, we'll go buy some more.
If you're going, we need some markers.
-And more blades for the cutter. -And boxes.
-"Playboy." -Glue.
Okay, somebody threw something weird in there.
Why's everybody messing around?
If we ran out of supplies,
get off your ass and go get some!
Do you guys know what
the yakisoba's supposed to be called?
We're calling that one Spring's Fragrant Breath.
What's this thing we're calling the Fallen Drop of Sun's Dew?
Oh, that's okonomiyaki.
This menu's totally insane, man.
How's anyone gonna know what they're ordering?
Hmm, Japanese culture is so interesting.
Normally I'd agree with you
but the names of those dishes are ridiculous.
Yoo-hoo!
So, what are guys gonna do for the arts festival?
It's called a Zuka cafe.
A what?
It's a cafe where you can watch a show that's done
in the same style as the Takarazuka Revue.
You can have a girl in a glamorous dress,
or if you want, a girl who's cross-dressing as a nobleman
-serve as your waitress. -Oh!
-You can have-- -Cross-dressing?
Ah! It's perfect!
Yu-chan and Minami-chan
are gonna be our most popular servers.
It's a kaleidoscope of beauty.
Who decided we'd be doing this?
Now I'm scared.
I can do the cheerleading, but this?
Whoa!
Those guys are amazing, aren't they?
Yeah, I know.
They are totally in sync with each other.
So tell me something.
Would you say Miyuki-san is being sadistic
and Minami-chan is being masochistic?
Yeah, good point.
I wonder if Takara-senpai's dynamic dance moves are
gonna be too much for Minami-chan to handle.
-Let's watch. -Sure, what the heck, right?
Would you guys stop drooling and go practice?
"Lucky Star."
The cheerleading outfits are here!
Wow!
They turned out wonderfully,
but I don't think I can wear it.
But these outfits are guaranteed to make the audience happy,
and that's a good thing.
You know it. The outfit was chosen by a hardcore fan
of all things cheerleadery.
Right, I heard stories about him.
Your big brother sounds like a cool guy.
Then the Zuka costumes are gonna drive you crazy.
I heard you guys are gonna be doing a cheerleader routine.
Uh-huh.
Can I come down and take pictures?
As long as you promise to behave yourself.
I'll behave myself.
Well, we haven't got the moves down yet.
So, I doubt if we're gonna be able to pull this off.
Don't worry, guys!
I'll give you a dose of Yui power and you'll be great.
Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo!
Thanks, but if we did take some of your power,
it would make us too spazzy and then we'd wear out quicker.
We're almost out of time
and we still haven't gotten our routine down yet.
Arts festival, huh?
I can't even remember what my class did for the one we had.
You know, our class did something like that too.
I think it's what you guys call a manga cafe.
Right, I remember.
All the boys in class brought their manga in that day.
You guys were way ahead of your time.
These days you can bring that stuff to school
and it's no big deal.
But they had strict rules about it when I was a kid.
Festivals were they only time we could have them.
Yeah, there are people who bring manga to school,
but I don't think it's something the school is aware of.
Oh, are you really going to tell fortunes?
Make sure you tell all your classmates that if I show up
they all have to give me good fortunes.
Well, that really isn't fortune-telling.
Oh, I've been meaning to ask.
What did you do for your school's arts festival?
Hmm. I think I remember every class and club
doing their own separate projects.
But, you know, in the end,
they were all rather typical things like haunted houses,
and places that serve okonomiyaki.
Isn't it odd how the things you did when you were my age
are the same as the things I'm doing now?
For example, did you have an exhibit that focused
on something cultural?
Like the history and craft of Paulownia wardrobe making?
-Seriously? -
Oh, honey, that sounds like it wouldn't be any fun at all.
You're right, it doesn't.
I know it doesn't.
Okay, guys, let's take a break.
We're gonna be so amazing.
I can't wait to see everyone's faces.
We still have a lot of work to do before we're ready,
so let's stay focused and keep working on it,
'til we can do it perfectly.
It's a good thing Hiiragi is here to crack the whip,
or we'd never be ready in time.
Well, I didn't wanna graduate without doing
something special with you guys.
Awww!
What are you looking at? Shut up!
Oh, no, really?
Sorry about that, I didn't know.
No worries.
He said today is the rehearsal day for the students only.
I guess they're still getting things ready.
And?
And he said that if we're not actually students here,
we're not allowed on campus 'til tomorrow.
I told you to make sure we can come here
before we came all the way out here!
I know you did, but I heard that
Akira-chan was going to be here today.
I'm sorry.
Oh, jeez, what a total waste of train fare!
We could have bought hamburgers!
I could have had a hamburger in my stomach now!
Well, for an unfinished haunted house,
yours is the best I've ever seen.
Very funny. What's with that outfit?
You're really gonna walk around like that?
I'm a walking ad for our fortune-telling thing.
Well, I think Kona-chan's costume is really cute.
It's important to have the right outfit.
I'm gonna tell a bunch of fortunes today.
You will buy soft-serve ice-cream
five minutes and 15 seconds from now.
You will drop it five minutes and 28 seconds from now.
You're telling fortunes, not predicting the future.
Cut it out!
Wow, your costumes look fantastic,
but wait 'til you see the outfits we put together.
It was cutting it close, but they got finished just in time.
What do you think?
Wow!
That's so cute.
Those costumes are wonderful.
It's a little embarrassing walking
around school in this outfit.
-Yeah, I can see why. -
I mean, you guys are super cute.
Senpai, it's almost time for Akira Kogami's show to start.
Oh, yeah, that's right. This should be good.
My name is Akira Kogami.
It's great to meet you, ma'am.
I'm gonna do the best I can to entertain everyone today.
Yeah, good. I'm Sakuraba.
Anyway, today's like some kind of rehearsal thing,
so take it easy, and I guess that's it.
Thanks. Oh, and break a leg.
Introduce yourself, Shiraishi.
Oh, sure. I'm Shiraishi,
chairman of the arts festival committee.
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
He's gonna take it from here.
If you need anything, ask him, okay?
Great, see you.
Thanks!

You gonna say something, or you just gonna stand there?
Huh?
Shouldn't you be at the monster's meeting?
-What the-- -Is there a problem here?
No, everything's just great.
We just got carried away,
planning stuff for the show and stuff.
You're an important guest for the school, Akira-sama.
And I'm gonna make damn sure you're treated like one.
Now what?
If you're gonna sing "Misoji Misaki" in the Lucky Channel
segment tomorrow, you'll need to do a mike check.
And after the show tomorrow,
you're doing some kind of panel.
Great, that sounds like a piece of cake.
Then, please head on over to the stage, thank you.
Yeah, right, you son of a--
- -Nice sign.
Hiya, luckies!
I wanna thank everyone for coming out today
to see little old me.
Are you guys ready to have bunches of fun today?
I know you are!
When will she get to feel
the arms of the man she loves caressing her?
She wanders the land alone now.
His last words, her only companion.
Searching for the things she can never find.
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Akira Kogami,
with her version of "Misoji Misaki."
- -Okay, cut it!
Let me finish singing, damn it!
It's only a mike check!
Besides we're out of time!
-Who cares! -I can't hear you!
I'm gonna kick your freaking ass,
you stupid wannabe!
Okay, guys, you ready?
This is our last rehearsal,
so let's get it right.
I never really thought this cheerleading idea
was gonna turn out to be anything special.
But I just wanna say I'm happy I have the chance
to do something cool with everyone.
Let's not worry about whether we do it right or not.
Let's just get out there and have fun.
All right!
- -Oh, it was so much fun!
What's up, you guys?
Why are you all still hanging around here?
We were practicing our cheerleading routine.
Oh, is it coming along okay?
Guess it's gonna be awesome then.
How about you buy us a round, ma'am?
Huh? Okay, sure.
You guys have been working so hard,
the least I can do is treat y'all to a drink.
Yes, you're the best.
You really don't mind?
Of course, I don't.
It's my treat, 'cause today is a special day for you.
But I want you to get that crowd pumped up for the festival.
Y'all got that?
Yes!
What's wrong, Tsukasa?
Huh?
Nothing's wrong.
It's just, well,
doesn't everything feel sort of weird right now?
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
I'm beginning to feel a little sad myself.
The best part of the festival is when everyone is
preparing their events the day before.
I guess tomorrow's gonna be the real deal, huh, guys?
Yeah, it is.
This is the last time we'll get to stay here late,
working on projects together.
Kind of makes you feel sad,
if you start thinking about it that way, doesn't it?
Tamura-san, you don't look so good.
It's nothing, just a little... nauseous.
Tsukasa, relax, you're all stiff.
Speak for yourself.
You don't look like you are ready to do this either.
They say the more nervous you are,
the more focused you're gonna be.
Oh, but I think I'm so nervous right now, I'm frozen.
-Check, check. -
Okay, folks, the Outou Festival is about to start.
The opening act is something our exchange student,
Patricia-san, came up with.
-It's a cheerleading routine... -
...by her and her friends.
So put your hands together and--
Could the person with the cell phone--
whoa! It's mine.
Stop, stop! Bad phone!
I knew something was gonna go wrong!
If I keep laughing like this,
I'm gonna pass out!
That was perfect timing!
He needs to get a better ringtone!
I feel so bad for him.
Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised
this happened to us.
I know, that was totally random, wasn't it?
And for my next trick--
sorry about that, folks.
What? Yeah, here we go. Let's try it again.
Here's Patty and her friends and their performance
of "Motteke Sailor Fuku"!
