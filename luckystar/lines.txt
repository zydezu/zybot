On your mark!
Get set!
You've done it again, Kona-chan.
That was amazing.
How come you aren't on any sports teams...
...when you're so athletic?
'Cause if I join a team...
...I'll miss my prime time anime.
Speedy
Lady
Say, Tsukasa.
Which end of a chocolate cornet do you start from?
The head, I suppose.
I see.
By the way...
Which side's the head?
The fat end or the thin end?
I would guess the thin end.
Oh.
I thought it was the fat end.
But why would the thin end be the head?
Well, doesn't it look like a seashell?
Why did you think it was the fat end, Kona-chan?
'Cause, you know...
It looks like a caterpillar?
A caterpillar?
But I guess it works better if you picture a seashell.
U-Um...
You could cut off the thin end...
...and eat it with the excess chocolate.
Now I get it.
Good thinking, Miyuki-san.
You're so smart.
Not at all.
Everyone has their own approach to eating.
How do you eat cream puffs?
Cream puffs, you ask?
Well...
I start by splitting it in half...
...and eating the lid after dipping it in the cream from the bottom...
And then I eat the bottom half.
This way, I don't have to worry about any cream spilling out...
...while maintaining a balance between cream and puff.
What about the ones that have both custard and cream inside?
How do you eat those?
Do you mix them up?
No.
I wouldn't do such a thing.
But how would you mix them?
Just asking.
When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake...
...or the chestnut on top of a Mont Blanc?
Let's see...
There are also strawberries tucked between layers of sponge cake.
I follow a normal distribution of strawberry, cream, and cake as I eat.
So there isn't a set time for eating the strawberry.
You really know your stuff.
I always save the strawberry for last.
But then I get full sometimes...
...so I end up not eating it...
...or someone in my family takes it.
Your favorites gotta come first.
Actually, I don't think I've ever seen anyone take a strawberry from Sis.
That's Kagami for you.
Doesn't miss a step.
Are you able to eat the last bite of a popsicle without dropping it?
Dropping it?
If you aren't careful...
...you drop the last bit, right?
What do you do, Kona-chan?
Suck it down to nothing.
You could rotate the popsicle as you eat.
That's a good idea.
I'm not very fond of ice cream cones.
Why?
I can't stand it when only the cone is left.
That's right.
You always end up with some cone left.
I push the ice cream into the cone as I eat.
How do you push the ice cream?
I do a little ~gui gui~ action as I eat.
~gui gui~, is it?
Yuki-chan prioritizes balance, right?
That's right.
Then what do you do with curry rice?
Do you mix the sauce with the rice?
No.
I don't mix them...
...but I make sure that they're equally proportioned.
I mix mine up.
What about you, Kona-chan?
Depends on the curry.
If there's any Worcester sauce or raw egg in it...
...I guess I do a little mixy-wixy.
Worcester sauce in curry?
It's good stuff.
Do you also put Worcester sauce on your fried eggs?
I put soy sauce on fried eggs.
I use mayonnaise.
On your fried eggs?
I don't mean boiled eggs.
You see, mayonnaise...
...goes well with most egg dishes.
Do you put it on your curry?
It's a must on white rice.
But the sweetness also goes well with beef bowls.
It's also good with parent-child bowls.
You know how eggs and chicken meat are child and parent.
So once I add mayonnaise, which is made from eggs...
...I call it an expanded family bowl.
Also...
I usually can't stand natto...
...but I was able to eat it once I added mayonnaise.
Can't imagine it.
But...
...putting mayonnaise on soft-boiled eggs might be best.
The fried eggs at my house are also half-done.
It's how my dad likes them.
He likes to suck out the yolk.
And if it's overcooked, he can't suck the yolk.
What about yakitori?
What about it?
Do you leave it on the spit?
Or do you use chopsticks to take it off?
Let's see...
If I'm eating one by myself, I'll leave it on the spit.
But if I'm with other people, I'll take it off.
Yeah, yeah.
Isn't it a little awkward when there's only one left?
I can't bring myself to take the last one.
As time goes by without anyone eating it...
It starts getting dry...
...and looking anything but appetizing...
...and no one's willing to make a move...
...but when the busboy takes it, you go...
"Wait, we're not done with that yet."
...kinda on reflex.
But then you end up leaving without eating it.
Such a waste.
I feel sorry for it.
And when you grill meat...
...I feel sorry for the meat that's all charred and stuck to the grill.
You have to eat while you're grilling and chatting...
...so it's a busy ordeal.
It's even worse with onion beef tongue slices since they're done in'no time.
You're right.
They're done after just one flip.
Flip?
Onion beef tongue slices?
You can't flip those.
Really?
If you flip them over...
...the onions on top will fall off.
Oh, yeah.
They'll finish cooking without any flipping.
I see...
I'll do that from now on.
You can never flip them.
Really...
By the way, is the head of a chocolate cornet the fat or thin end?
Locked up for two months
"I wanted to make her my slave
Super bad boy.
There've been a bunch of kidnapping cases recently.
Guys forcing girls to address them as "Master" and stuff.
Isn't that less...
...an issue of morals...
...and more an issue of playing too many dating sims and adult games?
It's a commonly used scenario.
Aren't you talking about yourself?!
Er, wait a tick.
Why are you so well versed in the adult game scenarios...
...Miss High School Second-year?
First Semester Midterm Grades
Miyuki Takara
Your grades are always so good.
Don't you have any faults, Miyuki-san?
I'm ashamed to say...
...that I have a tendency to brood over things...
...or space out.
I've cut my finger while using a slicer.
Ow!
And tripped over myself while in a hurry.
And gotten my bag stuck in the door on a train.
Miyuki-san.
Those aren't faults, but elements of moe.
Moe?
The clumsy factor.
What was going on inside Kona-chan's head during all that?!
Miyuki-san, why do you wear glasses when you're actually attractive?
You'll only nab a niche audience.
Nab's a little...
Setting aside the issue of popularity...
...why don't you wear contacts?
I heard that glasses make your vision worse.
Um...
I'm ashamed to be saying this in high school...
B-But...
I'm...
Scared!
Of contacts!
Or to be specific...
...putting things in my eyes.
I can never open my eyes when I'm underwater.
Damn!
She's cute to the core!
Must be innate.
Isn't that Miyuki-san?
YOSHIMIZU
OPTOMETRY
Is she here for an eye examination?
To get contacts?
YOSHIMIZU
OPTOMETRY
Miyuki-san's probably better off this way forever.
That looked painful...
A pillar of evolution.
Kagami's at home with a cold?
It looks like she doesn't have the flu though.
I'm stupid, so I don't have to worry about getting the flu.
I've heard that applies to colds...
...but it also applies to the flu?
There's a difference between a cold and the flu?
I thought the flu was like a super cold.
I-I think they're different...
But now I'm not sure anymore...
The difference between the flu and a cold?
Well...
The flu is caused by a virus.
The symptoms are a fever and aching throughout the body.
And there is a risk of complications.
On the other hand...
...the symptoms of a cold are a sore throat and runny nose...
...and the fever doesn't run as high.
And there are a number of other minute differences.
Which is why...
...they are different illnesses.
I see...
H-However...
Well, they share many similarities...
...so you could possibly say that the flu is an upgraded version of a cold...
I see!
Kona-chan.
What's with the pensive face?
Oh, nothing big.
I was just curious about something after our conversation this morning.
About a cold and the flu?
You didn't disagree when I said I was dumb.
N-No!
It's not like that!
Konata-chan.
Welcome.
She's here to visit Sis.
Thank you for visiting.
It's nothing.
Sorry to intrude.
Kagami actually looks pretty cute when she's asleep.
What is it?!
Why are you here?!
She's up. She's up.
Get out!
Visiting?
You?
For my sake?
That's right.
B-But I don't want you to catch the flu from me.
I appreciate the thought though.
Hah.
You know you're happy about it.
Is she worried about me...
...because of the new virus going around?
I figured she only ever had games and anime on her mind.
I'm a little touched.
Well...
I wanted to see your homework from the other day.
And I got to see your face while you were sleeping...
...so don't sweat it.
Get out!
Kagami!
Miyuki-chan's here to visit you!
Okay!
I'm sorry to intrude.
Sorry you had to come on a day off.
Is it all right for you to be up?
This is a little something.
Thanks.
I'm a lot better now.
My fever went down after I took some medicine.
Here.
Flowers and fruits! I'm overjoyed!
Have a seat.
Thank you very much.
I intended to visit earlier with Izumi-san and everyone...
...but my schedule hasn't been very forgiving.
It's okay.
I brought some materials from the student council meeting.
Thanks!
If you could take a quick glance without straining yourself...
Also, here are the budgets for each club.
And what else was there...
Um...
If I'm tiring you out...
...I'll leave.
This is how a visit's supposed to be!
D-Did something happen?
Actually, Konata showed up yesterday...
It was like, good grief.
That may just be how Izumi-san expresses herself.
The homework may have been an attempt at humor...
...in order to cheer you up.
And perhaps she saw how your face looked while you were sleeping...
...because she didn't want to wake you up.
Is this woman a saint?!
That would've never occurred to me.
Come to think of it...
Is Tsukasa-san not here today?
Good morning.
Are you feeling better, Sis?
As you can see...
She's more laid-back than the person who's sick.
U-Um...
I'm not like this every morning...
Just that I haven't really adjusted to daylight savings...
It's a little late, but welcome.
I completely understand.
I've been having a hard time waking up as well.
Th-That's right.
You get so sleepy these days.
Indeed.
And it's especially warm today.
That's the truth!
It can't be helped.
And you know how our last day off was also warm?
When I woke up, it was already evening.
I spent most of the time sleeping.
It's good to rest when you have a day off.
So I ended up wearing my pajamas the whole day.
I guess I still am.
Those are pajamas?
That's right.
They're quite adorable.
I can't tell that they're pajamas.
Really?
I wonder if I can just stay in them.
You could walk outside in them.
Could I go into a convenience store in these?
It's like an endless loop of dumb and dumber!
Nobody would blink an eye.
NURSE'S OFFICE
It's gone up a little...
No.
That might not be the case.
I'm wearing a wired bra with extra padding...
...which means extra weight.
That has to be it.
I wonder how many grams that adds.
Once you subtract that...
NURSE'S OFFICE
It's over...
I totally screwed up.
I forgot we had examinations today...
...so I wore my character print underwear.
I'm so embarrassed!
I haven't grown at all...
Damn it!
You get to look all happy by yourself!
Yo.
I'm here.
Sis.
I was wondering.
Kagami comes here a lot.
Do you have no friends in your class?
Don't put me on your level.
Are you trying to pick a fight?
Oh.
I thought you were being ostracized or something.
Worry less about me...
...and more about your lack of a social life.
You don't have to worry about that.
Believe it or not, I have around a hundred friends.
And I'm pretty good at social dealings.
And I'm in a party every night.
My comrades and I strive to recover the light stolen from the crystals...
...to save the world from oblivion...
...and rescue kidnapped princesses...
Aren't you talking about a game?!
I haven't seen that person in a while.
Who?
She's probably talking about some friend from a game.
He plays a warrior.
He went somewhere with a lot of monsters to train his battle skills, and I haven't seen him since.
I heard from someone else...
...that he was lying low in the sewers.
I wonder if he's okay.
Everyone's worried since he hasn't come out.
He isolated himself in the game?
I don't know the details...
...but his log-in info implies that he's been online the whole time.
So he's isolated in both the real and virtual world?!
Well, it's the same person in both cases.
That's right...
How did you two become friends?
A huge fishy-looking foreigner was about to take Tsukasa away...
...when I happened to show up.
Using my special fists of fury...
...and beautiful hurricane kick...
...I saved her.
Why do we always end up talking about games?
Well, that's what happens when you run into an experienced fighter.
I'm not sure you should've resorted to violence so quickly...
...but you did a good thing.
The foreigner was actually just asking me for directions...
...but I was having a hard time understanding him when Kona-chan showed up...
Hey!
You were totally at fault there!
And why do you look so proud about it?!
It's that time of year again...
Is something going to happen?
No.
I was thinking that the Tigers' season had started...
You don't like watching sports, Kona-chan?
You're really athletic...
...so I thought you might enjoy it.
Because if the game goes into extra innings...
...the schedule for new anime gets all messed up.
Sometimes, the show gets cancelled altogether.
It sucks when you lose something you like.
When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake, Kagami?
Why you asking?
I was wondering if you were the type to save your favorite for last.
I usually eat my favorite stuff last...
...but with strawberries, it depends on the situation.
Then do you grill both sides of an onion beef tongue?
Onion beef tongues?
It's done in no time anyway...
...but it'd go even faster if you did both sides.
You can't.
The onions will fall off.
Don't you add the onions after the meat's done?
Then the onions won't be grilled.
But aren't the onions just a topping?
You have no idea...
W-Well...
Wouldn't they both work...?
Do you think the head of a chocolate cornet is the fat or thin end?
The fat end?
We think the same.
Seriously?
Then which end do you start eating from?
Don't you cut off the thin end...
...and eat it with the excess chocolate?
Have you ever made any real-life friends besides us?
I guess I had a really close friend back in middle school.
So you had one.
I haven't been in touch for a while...
Wonder what she's up to...
She wrote in our graduation book...
...that her dream was to become a wizard.
So she was one of your kind?!
Good lucky!
It's finally time for Lucky Channel!
Now being broadcast on TV!
Okay!
Hello to everyone who's meeting us for the first time!
I'll be your navigator, Akira Kogami.
I'm Shiraishi.
Who're you?
Just kidding!
This person will be helping me out from now on.
Minoru Shiraishi-san!
Da-dada-dum!
Uh...
I'll be serving as Akira-sama's assistant.
I'm Minoru Shiraishi.
Nice to meet you.
Say what?
You're such a stick-in-the-mud.
Come on.
We're on TV now.
Be more crazy!
Just kidding!
Sorry.
I'm not used to this.
Okay!
Let's get rollin'!
We've received commemorative postcards from lots of people!
Ah, right.
Um...
This is from Berryz Lover in Osaka.
Congratulations on Lucky Channel making it to TV.
Thanks!
By the way, I have a question for Akira-san.
You are a well-known super idol.
How much exactly is an idol paid?
Please let me know.
Pay?
That's a rather direct question.
Y'know...
What's the point in even asking that?
A-Akira-sama?
Well, if you really want to know, I'll tell you.
To be frank, it jumps all over.
Sometimes, it's just cheap pay...
...and then there's your agency.
I'm still on a fixed salary...
...so who knows how much they're skimming off.
And I've been working since I was three...
...so all the money still goes to my parents.
They, like, give me an allowance.
And boy, do they skimp.
Come to think of it, Mama's been buying a bunch of name brand purses recently.
Is she paying for that with the money from this show?
Don't mess with me!
Am I supposed to be Cinderella?!
Wait...
Just because Papa hasn't sent you any money recently...
Hold on!
...doesn't make me your piggy bank!
You don't have to bring that up!
Oh no!
It's time to say goodbye!
Akira's so sad!
And so...
Send us any questions or comments about the show, please☆!
Shiraishi-san, ask them with a please☆!
Then we hope you'll be back next time.
See ya!
Oh, yeah.
Are you seriously going to show up in the actual show?
Who told you that?
The four of us don't karaoke together very often.
I rarely come to these places.
C'mon. C'mon.
We only have two hours, so start singing!
You don't need to rush us.
We still have time.
This is kind of exciting.
It's really fun.
It feels really good when you sing.
Huh?
Where's the catalog?
Catalog?
The catalog.
The catalog, is it?
You know.
The thing with all the song numbers in it.
This?
Yes.
Then I'll start!
You move fast!
And she already queued up three songs!
It'll be a waste if you don't load up the list.
What's this song?
Space Ironmen Kyodain!
You've gotta start with this one!
Never heard of it.
From Da! Da! Da-Da-Da-Da Planet Dada!
Go for it, Kona-chan!
Konata!
Comes the Earth Invasion Robot Army!
You're too loud!
Turn it down!
Take to the sky, big brother!
Why does she know this song?
Skyzel!
Run, little brother!
Granzel!
Two arms of Scrum-metal!
With a flash, it's a galaxy of fireworks!
Go! Go! Jet! Go! Go! Car!
Space Ironmen Kyodain!
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Konata.
So sleepy...
Why am I always so sleepy...
...the day after I get a lot of sleep?
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of sleeping a lot?
Next time:
Effort and Results.
「Effort and Results」
Look forward to next time!
Right?
Doesn't it stink?
Sure does!
Golden Week's almost over...
Did you already take care of your homework?
Not yet, actually...
You know how you can't help having fun on long vacations?
We're in trouble now!
Right, Sis?
Sorry.
I'm almost done.
But you've been playing with me the whole time...
Effort
and
Results
Thanks for the food.
I have a
question about this part...
How would I know
the answers if you don't?
Aren't you in college?!
Go wake up Tsukasa already.
No way.
She's not gonna wake up.
Wake up already!
Dad and Sis sure are late.
Didn't they have a
ground—breaking
ceremony this morning?
What...
...time is it?
I'm home.
It's already noon.
Welcome home.
Good morning...
It's already past noon.
I can't believe how
you can sleep so much.
Did you see the special final episode of Apron of Love last night?
Nope.
I fell asleep halfway through.
You were asleep?
It got really crazy!
A guy balanced a red wash basin on top of his head at the end!
Kagami!
You have a call from Miyuki-chan!
Okay.
Would you like to hold a study
session for checking homework answers?
Sounds great!
Let's do that!
Kagami!
You have a call from Konata-chan!
How about we do a study session for finishing off homework?
Wait one sec!
You're just going to copy my answers, aren't you?!
So let me copy your homework.
Right to the point, huh?
You can copy them...
...but if you don't do the homework yourself...
...you'll totally bomb the test after vacation.
You're right...
We'll only end up hurting ourselves...
I'm good at winging stuff the night before, so I'll be fine.
So let me copy.
At least pretend to be guilty!
I'm sorry to intrude.
Oh, welcome!
Welcome!
Oh.
Are you also here to study, Izumi-san?
No.
She's just copying.
Anyway...
You've barely touched it.
What were you doing during break?
Um...
First Day
Twenty-three pages of math...
Twenty pages
of world history...
Finally made it to
the Imperial Gate.
Thirty pages of English...
We have five days of vacation.
Assuming five
hours spent a day...
No, four hours...
That means 1.15
pages of math an hour.
Second Day
Getting a lot more
experience than I expected.
Oh no!
I haven't done any work today!
Wonder how much
more I need for a level.
Um...
I have three days left...
So let's go
with six hours a day?
Found a loincloth!
Third Day
Nobody remembers
the name of the guy
who spent ten years...
...watching over new workers.
This is starting to
get really slow.
It's Yutaka.
Well, I'm almost maxed out.
Two days left!
If I cram for the last two days...
So all that's left is...
Fourth Day
Golden Week's almost over...
Did you already take
care of your homework?
How about we do a
study session for
finishing off homework?
I wanted to do everything just as planned...
Mission failed.
Shouldn't have even bothered.
You're even worse!
So she ended up doing it herself, huh?
I guess she's still a hard-working girl deep down.
But her accuracy rate is too much for me to bear!
Pathetic...
Just pathetic!
Howdy!
Did y'all have a fun vacation?
Then again...
You had bunches of homework...
...and a test right after vacation...
...so you couldn't have been having fun the whole time.
It barely felt like a vacation.
So sad.
Too bad I just let loose and had a blast!
Teacher.
I also let loose and had a blast!
Hey.
Aren't these things designed so you can never get anything?
Depends on what you're going for.
Some things are especially hard to grab.
Right?
I could never bring myself to touch one of these machines.
Incredible!
Nah.
I already knew this one was gettable.
So maybe...
...if I went after that one...
I might actually get it.
Is that what you're thinking?
Nope! No way!
B-But...
...I guess I'll give it a try.
So you wanna.
Go for it, Sis!
Thought I had it...
Too bad...
Huh?
No way!
Why?!
A great person once said...
...that operating a UFO catcher is like opening a savings account.
Smart guy...
Not again!
Screwed up!
Here are your scores!
I was hopeless...
You achieved Taiko Rank 1!
You've got a great sense of rhythm, Kona-chan.
You achieved Taiko Rank 5!
Nah.
It's got nothing to do with rhythm.
The skills you pick up from gaming
end up being pretty useless in real life.
You're living proof of that.
You're strong, Kona-chan.
Pretty much.
How much time has she spent on this stuff?
Izumi?
Izumi's absent today?
Ms. Kuroi.
You have a call from Izumi-san.
Yes.
It's me.
Teacher, I'm terribly sorry...
...but I need to take a sick day...
That's unusual, Izumi.
Did you catch a cold?
No.
It's a bad case of May sickness.
I can barely move...
Just get your butt down here, now!
Hey!
We're leaving.
Why is your bag so full?
Testing starts tomorrow...
...so I have to take everything home for an all-nighter.
Don't tell me...
...you're going to cram all that tonight?
Honestly...
Waiting till the day before a test to take your textbooks home...
...is way too late!
But this is how I always wing it.
You sure sound confident.
Well.
Show me how good you really are then.
Modern
Literature
Math
English
First Semester Midterms
Okay!
Time to return your tests!
I want my mommy!
So-so, I guess.
How'd you do?
You probably shouldn't ask...
I worked hard, though...
Well, now...
What about Miss All-nighter?
Just fine. Thanks for asking.
That's just wrong!
So tired...
I don't feel like doing anything...
Come on.
Let's go.
But you still ended up wandering around with us, huh?
Comp Festival!
Discount on all QUO cards!
Gotta collect 'em all!
Okay.
Time to get a job.
You're so easy to read.
Seriously...
I've never heard of anyone being absent for May sickness.
I can understand how she feels though.
Doesn't it say sickness in the name?
Shouldn't it count as a serious disease?
Do you seriously mean that?
What exactly is May sickness again?
Miyuki.
Tell her.
Let's see...
It begins with the feeling of achievement one experiences...
...after accomplishing a major goal such
as getting into college or getting a new job.
When new relationships beginning in
April don't work out as well as you'd like...
...you are unable to keep up with the gap
between the new life you imagined and reality.
As a result, you feel helpless and weary.
So plain lethargy might not be considered May sickness...
Besides, it's got nothing to do with...
...second-years in high school like us.
I'm always pumped by the change of pace in spring.
Oh, really.
Still, while I'm not as bad as Konata...
...I do feel unusually tired this time of year.
Once I'm home...
...I can't bring myself to do homework.
Me too!
Nobody's gonna comment?
Why are you sighing, Miyuki-chan?
I'm embarrassed to be saying this at this age...
As embarrassed as I was about the contacts matter...
...but I've been avoiding the dentist's because it terrifies me...
...and I got a cavity the other day...
It even hurts when I drink water.
Isn't that...
...normal?
I'm pretty scared of the dentist's myself.
But why did you avoid the dentist's...
...until your teeth started hurting?
Strangely enough...
Even when I know that my teeth will end up hurting...
You still don't want to go to the dentist's, right?
When the pain first starts...
...you choose not to go to the dentist's...
...while you can still live with the pain.
Is the dentist really that scary?
I've never needed to go so I don't know.
You've never gone to the dentist's?
Lucky you...
There's that hospital smell...
Or the nerve-wracking wait.
Ooh! Ooh!
And the sound of the drill gets me every time!
Change Getter!
It's terrifying!
But guys probably like to go to the dentist's, right?
Why?
Aren't drills like a man's romance?
Dinosaur Empire!
I've heard they love it when robots fight using drills!
But they probably don't like having their teeth drilled...
I've been wondering...
Aren't the receptionists and assistants...
...usually pretty ladies?
Now that you mention it, it does seem that way...
Wonder why...
Perhaps it's one of their hiring criteria...
Exclusively beautiful assistants and drills, huh?
That does indeed sound like something geared towards males.
Then...
What would a dentist's office for females be like?
You'd have to get rid of that smell first.
And switch the patient's chair for a soft, auto-massaging recliner.
Then they should also utilize aromatherapy, right?
And include a foot massage while you're being treated.
That sounds nice.
And to numb the pain, they let you play games.
It might be a little difficult to play games at the same time...
But it's a good way to distract you from the pain.
They could give you headphones and play your favorite songs.
Sounds good.
That would also be nice.
But I still don't like the dentist's.
That's true.
What's this?!
What's wrong?
Well...
They're animating another series I like...
...but they're using a completely different cast from the drama CD.
Don't get it.
Was this the work of a higher power?
Personal issues?
Money?
I never buy drama CDs...
...so as long as the voices match the original characters...
...I don't care who they use.
It doesn't work that way, Kagami.
People who have gotten used to the drama CD...
...feel like something's wrong when they start watching the anime.
It takes a while for the feeling to go away.
Well...
...there's one good thing that comes out of this.
What's that?
Drama CD and anime.
You can enjoy two different worlds through them.
Two for the price of one.
You're a die-hard fan, huh?
Thank you very much!
Well...
One of us will be taking Miyuki-san's leftover nugget...
Let's say it goes to whoever wins a staring contest.
Wha—
You're like a little kid.
A staring contest?
That sounds fun!
Kagami's probably gonna lose.
Did you say something?
Then let's go...
Stare-down!
That was...
...so bad!
Wow...
You...
You didn't even look human!
Hey, you guys are overreacting.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
There was a long line for the restroom.
Did something happen?
Hey.
Show that face to Miyuki!
No way.
It was incredible, Miyuki!
I've never seen anything like it!
Fine then.
It's amazing every time I see it!
That face may come in handy
during the talent stage of entrance exams.
That's it, Konata!
It'll get you into college!
Guaranteed!
I'm not exactly thrilled.
There was this thing on TV about the average
number of books a person in Japan reads annually...
...and they said to omit manga and limit the count to normal books.
Well, manga's...
Do light novels count?
I'm not sure.
Light novels should be okay...
What about picture books?
Since they're called books, they might count...
Other fantasy stuff like Harry Potter is considered normal...
So what do you call a normal book?
And the TV show ended by saying...
...how young people are becoming increasingly illiterate...
...but doesn't browsing the Internet and blogging...
...actually improve your literacy?
I get it, and then I don't...
Yo.
Let's get going.
Wait one minute.
Sorry.
I can't go home with you guys.
Do you have something to do?
That's unusual.
I started working.
Wait!
She actually got a job!
Is Comp Festival really that important?!
Anyway...
Konata sure surprised me.
She sure did.
She really got a job.
I thought she was just joking.
That's also true...
...but I was talking about how somebody actually hired her.
Th-That's a little harsh...
Besides...
I can't picture her doing manual labor.
Th-That's true...
I wonder where she's working.
Maybe at a bookstore?
Since she likes manga?
Excuse me.
I'd like this.
Hold on.
I'm busy right now.
Ka-ching!
I hope she doesn't get fired...
Then how about a convenience store?
Excuse me.
I'd like this.
Fourhundredninetyeightyen.
Exactchange.
Thankyoupleasecomeagain.
Doubt it.
Then what about a fast food place?
Fresh Salad
Ice Cream Cone
Vanilla
Chocolate
Strawberry
Smile
I'm smiling. Gotta problem with it?
I don't see it happening...
I guess that also eliminates a family restaurant.
Welcome.
I wonder where she's working.
Traffic survey?
No way.
Video rental store?
Not too sure about that.
A bar.
Nah.
Pizza delivery.
No driver's license.
Supermarket cashier.
Impossible.
Cram school teacher.
Unthinkable.
A bread factory!
That leaves...
Let's ask her tomorrow.
Hey, Konata.
Where're you working?
Tell us!
Just a normal costume café.
It fits her so perfectly!
But should she really be working there?
Good lucky!
I'm Akira Kogami!
This is the second episode of Lucky Channel!
Akira's going all-out!
O-kay!
Next to me...
...we have my wonderful assistant!
Minoru Shiraishi-san!
Take it away!
For-For-For-For—
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
I'm just a beginner...
...so I hope that you'll just remember my name.
Yes.
Clap. Clap. Clap.
Okay!
This segment's only just begun...
...but we already have an eruption of messages from everyone!
Akira's super happy!
Thanks!
Man...
This is really something.
I suppose you could call this...
...an indication of Akira-sama's popularity.
Wha—
What?
I saw today's episode.
Yes?
Didn't you show up?
In the actual show.
You were in it, weren't you?
They were gracious enough to put me in.
Whatever.
Oh, yeah...
What scene were you in again?
Uh, I believe...
...scene 45 in part A.
The classroom scene right after vacation.
Now I remember.
You didn't have much of a presence so I forgot.
Well, I only had one line this time.
Whazzat?!
Not good enough for you?!
No! Absolutely not!
Not sure a newbie should be actin' that way.
Y'know, back when I debuted...
Debuted?
How old were you then?
Three.
I was happy just to get any lines then.
Quantity isn't the issue.
You're absolutely right.
My nerves were a wreck after
being surrounded by so many veterans.
It was an educational experience!
You were pretty stiff.
Stiff as a board.
Ooh, look! I'm an amateur.
Y'know.
That was way too...yeah...
Do it again right now.
Here?
There's a chance you'll appear again, right?
I suppose...
Then you better practice some.
I'm offering you help here!
Yes, ma'am!
Please help me out!
Gimme the script.
Which scene was it again?
Scene 45.
This one, huh?
Then I'll be Ms. Kuroi.
Please do.
Ready and...
Action!
Howdy.
Did y'all have a fun vacation?
Then again...
You had b-b—
Bunches.
Bunches of homework...
...and a test right after vacation...
...so you couldn't have been having fun the whole time.
It barely felt like a vacation.
What was that?
No good at all.
That line had no feeling to it.
Feel—
Here!
Right here!
You gotta make 'em feel it right here!
I'm sorry.
If you're just gonna read your lines, a monkey could handle that.
A monkey can't...
It's time to say goodbye!
Time just flies...
...when you're happy, right?
And so...
Send us any questions or comments about the show please!
We'll see you next time.
Bye-bye!
So yeah.
What were the regulars like?
What do you mean?
Y'know...
Does it look like anyone's going to get knocked off?
Aren't they all like fighting with each other?
No...
It didn't look that way to me...
Then you're supposed to...
You're amazing, Kona-chan!
You were very passionate.
Hey, Konata!
Are the other two songs like this?
There's anime stuff along with the SFX stuff.
That's not what I meant!
Sing something the rest of us know!
I can sing whatever I want.
Let's see...
Here's the remote.
Come on, Tsukasa.
If you don't order a song...
...we'll end up listening to her endless medley of anime songs.
I'm okay with that.
This is actually quite fun.
Even you, Miyuki?!
Sorry if I block anyone's view.
I'm gonna stand this time.
Now what?
If you don't stand up when you sing...
...your voice can't truly shine.
You're gonna sing even louder?!
Actual footage from the show!
This is kinda cool!
Looks like it was made way before we were born.
ZARADO!
ERADO!
GARADO!
SHINE, JANKERU!
OH! OH, OH!
HIGH IN THE SKY!
OOH, OOH!
USE SKILL, POWER, AND SOUL!
Here are your drinks!
Thanks.
ZABITAN!
TAKE THAT!
EVIL!
TAKE THAT!
Who ordered the oolong tea?
GABURA!
That's me.
OH! OH, OH, OH, OH!
The iced lemon tea?
ROAR, JANKERU!
That would be mine.
The orange juice?
AKUMAIZER 3!
Over here.
The ginger ale?
THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH TO TAKE!
Sorry.
Could you just set it over there?
OH!
ONLY ONE PATH TO TAKE!
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Kagami.
When you buy juice from a vending machine...
...and put in a 200 yen coin and get back a
50 yen coin and a 10 yen coin as change...
...it's like, winner!
But when you ride the train...
...and try to buy a 150 yen ticket...
...and put in a 100 yen coin
thinking that you have five 10 yen coins...
...but once you put in four, you find out you're short one.
Since you have no choice, you put in another 100 yen coin...
...and get back nine 10 yen coins...
...and it's like, loser!
Next time:
「All Kinds of People」
All Kinds of People.
Look forward to next time.
Oh, yeah...
We switch to summer uniforms today.
Someone like Konata will probably show up in her winter uniform.
At least one person in our class will forget.
Good morning, Sis.
There's one in this house.
All Kinds
of People
Rats!
I forgot to sign up for the TV drawing.
Bah.
I kinda wanted the prize.
An apron from Apron of Love.
Not enough love.
You forgot because you don't have enough love.
Not really.
More like I've been busy with student council stuff and tests.
Nope, nope.
Those are just excuses.
I've never forgotten.
Don't put me on the same level as
someone who only ever thinks about having fun!
And the way you put it really pisses me off!
How do you win a drawing?
To put it simply...
Love!
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just a loveless woman.
Well...
If you jot down the usual stuff...
...you're not going to win.
What do you put on yours?
Stuff that'll help me win.
How?
Good handwriting is a fundamental must.
You have to design a postcard that just begs to be drawn.
Like what?
Like...
Use a fluorescent marker to draw a border around the postcard.
That'll stand out.
Then you add a picture related to the prize.
A picture, huh?
I can't draw very well though.
In that case...
...just send in as many entries as you can.
I can probably handle that.
But...
No matter how many you send...
...write each one out without using a printer.
And send out a hundred each time.
A hundred?!
Isn't that normal?
Wouldn't that cost a lot?
You're fighting for something you want.
That calls for passion and guts!
But wouldn't it be cheaper just to buy it then?
Some things in this world can't be bought with money.
Can you fit a hundred postcards in a mailbox?
You don't send them all at once...
...but a few here and a few there.
And over the course of a few days.
Depending on who's running the drawing...
...you might get caught.
Well, sometimes you're better off without the tricky stuff.
And sometimes it's the exact opposite.
So what do we do?
Like I said...
Love!
Yeah, yeah.
Anyway, if you want to win...
...glance through free newspapers and flyers...
...and look for drawings that
probably aren't going to attract many people.
You'll have a high chance of winning.
I'll give it a try!
Where's the love in that?
You know, for twins...
...you don't look anything like each other.
That's 'cause we're fraternal twins.
So it's more like comparing sisters.
Identical twins look exactly the same...
...but fraternal twins can be...
...pretty different in appearance and personality.
I see.
Tsukasa is laid-back...
...but Kagami is pretty crazy.
What was that?!
If you had the same hairstyles with the same ribbons...
...you might end up looking the same.
Kona-chan!
No good.
Kagami could never be the cutesy type.
Zip it!
Don't insult me with your weird fantasies!
Can you use telepathy?
You know.
With twins...
Even when they're raised separately...
...they end up having similar lifestyles and significant others.
And sometimes they end up marrying another pair of twins.
And when one of them is in danger...
...the other one can sense it from a completely different place.
There are all kinds of mysterious phenomena.
So can't you use telepathy?
Give it a spin.
Abracadabra!
You read way too much manga.
Same with ManaKana...
ManaKana?
I heard that they have a few differences.
By the way, Mana is the careful one...
...and Kana is the optimistic one.
And apparently they sound a little different when they sing.
That reminds me...
ManaKana thought they were fraternal twins for a long time...
...but they recently learned that
they were actually identical twins.
Seriously?!
Is it really that surprising?
The definitions for identical and fraternal twins...
...have changed recently.
Which means that you two could be identical twins.
Your identical traits would be...
You both like sweets, right?
Love 'em.
I guess.
You're both left-handed.
That's right.
What's your favorite color?
White maybe.
Black.
The same colors as your souls.
What was that?!
All this talk about eggs and black
and white cookies has made me hungry.
Nobody was talking about food.
It's suffocating in here.
We just got on and I've already broken a sweat.
It's that time of year.
Hot...
They haven't turned on the air conditioning yet.
H-Hey!
Hot...
Soujiro Izumi
Konata
After a long courtship,
we, Kiyotaka Narumi
and Yui Kobayakawa,
will be tying the knot
on June **.
Ladybug Samba, punk version.
One of my cousins is getting married this month.
So she'll be a June bride.
Sounds wonderful.
How does this...
...wet and gloomy season supposedly signify happiness?
Why does getting married in June make you happy?
The name June...
...is generally said to be...
...derived from the name of the Roman goddess, Juno.
In Greek mythology...
...Juno is known as Hera...
...the goddess of marriage and fertility.
Which is why those who get married
in Hera's month, the month of June...
...are said to receive her protection and blessing.
But wasn't Hera Zeus's wife?
Yes, that's right.
I have this image of Hera being extremely jealous...
...so I'm not feeling this happy thing.
What?
Would you rather wear a dress or a kimono for your wedding?
I would wear a dress.
It's been my dream since I was a child.
I'd also go with a dress.
But a kimono would also be nice...
I wanna wear both!
They have miniskirts and really colorful dresses these days.
A miniskirt wedding dress?
It'd look really cute with lots of frills on them.
Lots of dreams!
Lots of frills!
Right?
You're Angel Salvia.
Wait.
Your hair makes you look more like Daisy.
So a yellow top and miniskirt it is.
Tsukasa-san.
You'd probably look good in a miniskirt.
Really?
Your dress is important...
...but the person you're getting married to is also important.
A childhood friend?
Or a rich lady?
Tough choice to make.
One has lots of money...
...and the ability to cast Beho*mi and l***zun.
But as far as feelings are concerned...
Bianca hands down!
Oh, Kagami.
You're the true love type, huh?
I thought you'd go for the money.
No comeback, huh?
Yo, Konata.
I've got a question about a game I borrowed the other day.
Oh.
Hold it right there, Kagaminya.
Isn't it more fun when you figure it out yourself?
You have a point.
Yep, yep.
Since you understand that you should do things yourself...
...you'll do your own homework from now on, right?
Don't the detectives in manga and TV shows...
...run into an awful lot of murders?
Like in Conan or Kindaichi.
There wouldn't be a story otherwise.
Really?
Couldn't they just solve normal cases?
Normal?
Like travel around Japan in search of missing persons.
Tailing people would translate well into a game.
With plenty of thrill and suspense.
I guess.
You could also conduct investigations into unfaithful wives.
Or look for pets that ran away?
Yep, yep!
But would that be fun to watch?
Probably no fun at all.
Right?
Also...
Cases in real life...
...don't really use any brilliant tricks...
...like the ones you find in manga and TV shows.
I guess not.
Fabricated fingerprints that can't be
detected through a luminol reaction.
Stuff that's a step ahead of forensic labs.
Well...
Anything too good might lead to copycats.
Or be too sensitive for broadcast.
Ah, or that...
The really hard cases end without
anyone realizing they happened or go...
...unsolved.
That'd be wrong in so many ways!
Don't you hate how it's been
constantly raining the past few days?
You're right...
And I used to like rain...
You get soaked...
...and you can't hang clothes out to dry...
...so I've never really liked it.
Why did you like rain, Kona-chan?
Because baseball games would be
cancelled and I'd get to watch anime.
I see.
Sounds just like something you would say.
They have a lot more dome stadiums now.
Is something wrong?
You often see idiots and geniuses
going to the same school in anime...
Cease that immediately.
Bite me!
Get lost, neener-neener!
Isn't that actually kinda strange?
If you put it that way...
...in some recent anime...
...the teacher looks the same age as the students.
Or even younger.
Teach.
YOUTH
HI
IT'S
BACKWARDS
BACKWARDS IS
THE GREATEST ECSTASY
LUCKY STAR DASH!
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS
WHAT'S INSIDE
AGE MEANS NOTHING
IN THE FACE OF LOVE
WRYYYYY~
Yes, Ta*****na-san?
The world's always been interested in watching...
...the gap between physical age and mental age.
Don't get it.
You shouldn't question it.
In fact, wouldn't a student who's
really different from everyone else...
...be the real mystery?
Yeah.
I agree one hundred percent.
I shouldn't be saying this...
...but I don't know how you got into this school, Konata.
You're good at putting stuff off till the night before...
...so you didn't study until the night before, right?
What?
You mean she really did?
Nah.
Well, I couldn't have pulled it off in one night.
That gave me a scare.
But I'm impressed that you actually kept studying.
Did a quiz game come out for DS or something?
My dad set some conditions.
A D-rank would mean a Pippin.
A C-rank would mean a 3DO.
A B-rank would mean a PS2.
Papa Izumi.
You really know how to deal with your daughter, huh?
I've been wondering...
Isn't the real mystery how Tsukasa's in the same school as us?
She said it without even blinking!
Woo-hoo!
Come back in ten years!
I won again!
Damn it!
I can't beat her at fighting games.
She's spent way more time on them than I have.
Challenge to me a different game if you want.
Sure about that?
Then next is...
A quiz game!
N-No way...
I lost to Konata in a game of knowledge?
Unbelievable...
Don't tell me...
...she memorized the question order?
Humiliated.
Her memory's incredible when it comes to gaming.
What should we play next?
Don't be in such a hurry.
Huh? That's weird.
Didn't you have a really easy party game?
How do you know all the games I have?
You could probably beat me at that one.
It just stunk!
You've barely eaten any snacks, Kagami.
Usually, you wolf them down.
There's no real reason for it.
I know.
Dieting for summer?
It's not like that.
Not like you have anyone to show your swimsuit off to.
Shut it!
It's none of your business!
Oh, yeah.
Weren't you guys born on Tanabata?
Isn't your birthday soon?
What about it?
You remembered our birthday.
Seventeen, huh?
Seventeen's right before the big one.
What does that mean?
In the year before a critical year...
...unlucky things begin to happen.
As our birthday approaches...
...I'm getting worried...
...so I bought a bunch of wards...
...and power stones.
That sounds like fun.
Sure is!
I couldn't stop buying them.
And like...
We have wards against rage at our place.
Er, no.
All-purpose ward.
Wards against rage, hah.
Like...
We ensure safe pregnancy and protect
you from traffic accidents at the same time!
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Did you know that your birthday is Ponytail Day?
I had no idea.
But why July 7th?
Because Vega from the Tanabata legend had a ponytail.
Sounds like a stretch.
There's a Japan Ponytail Society...
...and they give an award every year to a
celebrity who they think would look good with a ponytail.
Really...
But I have a feeling that anyone would look good with a ponytail.
Sure about that?
My hair's the shortest...
...so it's barely a ponytail.
But a little ponytail's pretty cute.
Yours also looks good, Kona-chan.
You could go with that on an everyday basis.
Think so?
Sure.
S-Sis also...
Kagami's is...
Fine!
I get the idea!
I'll undo it!
All manly like a warrior.
Sorry about that!
Don't drunks often wear ties around their heads?
Is that supposed to mean something?
Oh, that?
Isn't that just when the guy loosens the tie...
...and tries to pull it off over his head...
...but it gets stuck?
In that case...
...it's a lot weirder that they're always carrying a takeout box.
Takeout box?
The thing Kato-chan from the Drifters carries.
I'm not getting it...
Drunks these days...
...pretty much always have a tie around
their head and a takeout box in their hand.
Right?
I hope Vega and Altair meet this year.
Shine. Shine. Shine.
Hope those rage wards of yours can deliver a miracle.
Mind your own business.
They're giving away all varieties of QUO cards at Comp Festival.
Oh, yeah...
You're always collecting QUO cards...
...but do you ever use them?
I don't.
Then why spend the effort?
Isn't it natural to want any item...
...related to a series you like?
As a fan. As a collector.
Not really...
...if you're never gonna use them...
You can't use them!
You have to take good care of them!
It really pisses me off when I see someone use one.
You're not supposed to use these things!
Much less auction them off or sell them.
Using them makes you a surefire failure...
...as a fan and as a collector!
I really can't say anything when you're so worked up.
In my case, I need at least three.
One for preservation.
I keep it in a special case.
Then one to take out occasionally to look at.
What's the last one for?
An extra.
What's that?
Don't you always want two or three of something you like?
Yeah, yeah.
You don't.
I'm just a geek.
A weirdo.
No.
I kind of understand what you're saying.
You'd expect Tsukasa to be popular with guys...
...but I've never heard anything like that.
Tsukasa's a little plain and doesn't really stand out.
Isn't it because she's got a scary sister guarding her like a hawk?
Did you say something?
I'm not sure if I'm really plain...
...or if it's more that Kona-chan and Yuki-chan are really unique.
Miyuki knows all kinds of things.
And she's pretty.
Has a good figure.
Wears glasses.
Hates the dentist.
Clumsy.
Naturally clueless.
Hey now.
Isn't this getting a little weird?
But it's true that I haven't heard anything about Miyuki.
Maybe it's because she's so pretty...
...that everyone's afraid to approach her?
I doubt that.
She's kind...
...and really good at helping others.
That's true.
Maybe a lot of guys ask her out.
But she turns them down?
Turns them down, huh...
Nah.
Maybe she doesn't realize that they're asking her out.
That's possible.
Yuki-chan can be a little clueless...
...so an indirect approach might not work.
Man, the guys in your class are hopeless.
Doesn't a single one of them have the guts...
...to confess his passionate feelings to Miyuki?
Guess not...
We don't have enough maniacs in our class.
Miyuki-san's type is usually a bigger hit with maniacs.
Maniacs, huh?
Right?
Oh.
It's already this late.
I'll need to excuse myself.
Really?
Please continue to enjoy yourselves.
Then I'll excuse myself.
See you later!
Buh-bye.
Anyway...
Going on with the story...
...that person was actually...
O-Oh?
I-I'm terribly sorry!
Yay!
I-I'm sorry.
Man, oh, man...
Doesn't that always happen?
I did it the other day.
So did I.
Everybody does it at least once.
Right, Konata?
I haven't.
That was definitely an element of moe!
Miyuki-san.
Good job!
Good lucky!
Okay!
Today's another whoo-whoo happy episode of Lucky Channel!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami.
And...
Uh.
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
It's a pleasure.
Okay, okay.
The two of us have now done this show...
Ta-da!
Three times after today!
How do you feel about it, Shiraishi-san?
Have you gotten used to it?
Well...
Not yet...
So sorry.
It feels like Shiraishi-san hasn't opened up to me yet.
And it looks like we're sitting further apart than usual.
Is this what they mean by emotional distance?
Sob.
Th-Th-That's not true!
Shuffle.
Okay!
Let's get rollin'!
Um...
We've got something the fans will love today!
Guess what?
We'll be doing our first
introduction for a member of the regular cast!
Da! Da-da-dum!
Okay, uh...
We'll be introducing Miyuki Takara-san today.
Let's see...
The class representative, well-mannered, kn—
Knowledgeable.
Knowledgeable...
...in both literary and culinary arts. A perfect person.
Shiraishi-san.
You know Miyuki-san, right?
But of course!
She's so wonderful, yeah?
First, there's her glasses!
And then she's pretty as a button.
With those looks...
...you'd expect her to be hard to approach...
...but she's actually a friendly person...
I wish you'd talk that much on the radio show...
You can't stop talking when it's about Miyuki-san.
No!
That's not it...
Well, yeah.
Miyuki Takara-san, is it?
A pretty face.
With large breasts.
And other various elements of moe.
Isn't she so lucky to be a pretty character?
Akira-sama, that's a little...
The maniacs love her.
Uh, maniacs is a little...
But you know...
If it's maniacs you want, I'm a huge hit with those lolicons...
Too bad!
It's time to say goodbye!
And so...
Send us any questions or comments about the show, please!
Please look forward to next time.
See ya!
So what's she really like?
Exactly the same.
No way!
Doesn't she like smoke a pack at a time backstage?
No worry of that. She isn't you.
That was fun!
A unique song.
I'd like to hear a song that normal people can enjoy already.
You know the next one, Kagami.
Guess it from the intro!
It's not another weird song, is it?
What was this song again?
Don't know...
Kagami.
The answer is...
It's from FMP. FMP.
And it's Kagami's favorite...
Fumoffu!
Really...
I-I just read the novels...
...and got a little hooked.
Say a day were to come when tears begin to fall...
You're really good, Kona-chan!
You can also sound like an adult.
Isn't she just doing an imitation?
...I would want your back for comfort.
So?
What are you two going to sing?
I wonder if there's anything I can sing...
I don't know very many songs...
Kindness can be very cruel at times...
Anything works.
Look at Konata.
Just sing what you want to!
Um...
Then I'll have a look.
I'm not very confident about my singing...
The more we try, the more we lose sight of the answer.
It's fine.
We're the only ones who'll hear you.
Just take it easy.
Really?
In that case...
If you can see rainbows in our town after the rain has just passed...
Then let's set out now.
Something's about to begin...
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Tsukasa.
Guess what?
I laughed so hard the other day that I couldn't breathe.
Then at school one morning...
I'm already out of time?
Next time:
「Motivation Issues」
Motivation Issues.
Look forward to next time!
Well, let's get going
Let's go!
Stop messing around and start!

Okay.
Who can solve this one?
Shiraishi.
You just called on me!
Really?
Then Izumi.
Izumi?
No, I wasn't asleep.
I didn't say anything yet.
Motivation
Issues
I forgot my English textbook!
Why don't you go borrow Kagami's?
They already had English, right?
Honestly...
You're so careless.
Thank you!
You should double-check everything the day before.
Tsukasa tends to forget stuff a lot, right?
Come to think of it...
...Konata doesn't forget stuff like textbooks often.
That's because I'm surprisingly diligent about those things.
Plus, I never take my textbooks home in the first place.
Oh, is that so?
That's not called diligent at all!
But you can't review what we
went over in class without a textbook.
I never study at home.
Since you end up cramming the night before...
But Kona-chan's good at putting off stuff till the night before.
That could be why I forget to do my homework.
You don't forget to do it.
You just don't want to do it.
So show me your homework for Japanese this afternoon.
Already at it again, huh?
I've been thinking...
Miyuki's in your class...
Ask her to show you her homework.
How should I put this...
Miyuki-san's such a nice person...
...that it ends up being hard to ask her for anything...
You know what I mean?
There's this sensation you get.
I get what you're saying...
...but I still can't accept it.
Izumi.
Izumi?
What? She's late?
Stop!
I'm not late!
I was late because I had to help someone!
I usually go around with this guy...
...but I just couldn't get away today!
He was like it's okay, we can split up...
...but the other five of us had gotten one...
...and he was the odd one out...
...which kinda left a bad feeling.
When you've been in the same party for a
long time, you wanna help each other out.
So we all backed him up.
Yeah, friends are a beautiful thing.
Really...
So you were up all night playing online games again.
Kept playing after I logged off, huh?
Izumi.
Izumi?
What? She's late?
Stop!
I'm not late!
This girl crashed into me in the shopping district.
Then she suddenly grabbed my hand and took off running.
Eventually, I learned that she'd stolen some taiyaki...
...and was on the run...
I was wondering what any of this had to do with me...
...but I had no choice but to duck into
a café to hide from the taiyaki baker.
So many potential comebacks...
But I can't!
As a teacher!
As a human being!
I'm down with a summer cold.
Izumi.
What's wrong?
Teacher, I'm terribly sorry...
...but I need to take a sick day...
Hey, now.
Too much gaming again?
The same trick won't work every time.
No, I'm sick...
Let me guess. You've got a summer cold, right?
Winter's over and the weather's nice...
...so stop being lazy and get to class!
So she totally treated me like the boy who cried wolf yesterday.
You reap what you sow.
Are you okay now?
It looks like my fever broke...
...but my throat still hurts.
That means you breathe through your mouth.
Huh?
Well...
You can also breathe through your mouth...
...but wouldn't you usually breathe through your nose?
No...
But Kona-chan breathes through her mouth more than her nose.
Because...
You know?
If a virus enters through your mouth, you get a throat infection.
And if a virus enters through your nose, you get a nasal infection.
So people with sore throats probably had a
higher chance of a virus entering through their throat...
This is when we turn to Miyuki-san.
Yeah...
Huh?
So hot...
Don't feel like doing anything...
Kagami?
About your birthday party today...
How about we hold it at my place?
It's so hot that I can't move a step.
We're baking cookies right now.
I'll go.
Hurry it up.
Welcome!
Happy birthday!
Tsukasa and other.
Don't abbreviate me off!
Happy birthday.
Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san.
Thanks!
Thank you!
And it isn't much...
...but I have presents for you.
I'm so excited!
Open it up.
Matching earrings!
I considered a number of options...
...but I had a hard time making up my mind.
And here are presents from me!
Oh, joy.
Open it up.
[Caption: Chief]
What is this?
Brigade chief armband.
Try it on.
Why should I put this on?!
I figured it would fit you perfectly.
It would go better on you.
Um...
Then what is this...
It cost a fortune...
Wear it with care.
Don't try to make both of us cosplay!
It's barely any different from our uniform.
That's quite a problem.
If it's too big...
Right?
Just sucks.
And it stinks.
Hey.
It's our birthday.
You could hold back a little.
Tsukasa's cookies are always so good.
I baked them with her this time.
Kinda learned as I went.
What's wrong?
Now that I think about it...
...some of these cookies don't taste as good as the others.
Weird, isn't it?
What was that?!
Wonder if this is one of Kagami's.
Might as well eat the cake, too.
Kagamin – works hard only on her birthday.
Zip it.
By the way...
...isn't there always a fight over how to cut the cake?
Why?
You know.
When you cut a cake into a bunch of slices...
...how do you divide up the strawberries on top...
...or decide who gets the chocolate decorations?
My older sisters all love chocolate.
Rats...
I was off.
Wouldn't expect that from Kagamin.
What are you talking about?!
Let's eat!
Let's eat.
What?
My strawberry's awfully small.
What is it?
Do I have cake on my face?
I just discovered another facet of Kagamin's charm.
You sound just like Shin-chan, so stop it.
It's almost summer break.
That's right.
The beach, the pool, and summer festivals...
Are there any other usual events?
Twitch.
Summer is all about the annual celebration!
The beginning of the battle!
The one and only...
Comiket!
No, no, no, no, no.
That only applies to you.
Is that like cricket?
W-Well...
Everyone has their own different thing to do.
Like visiting relatives or something.
Good morning.
Miyuki...
...do you have some kind of regular summer activity?
Let's see...
I'll be taking a vacation overseas again this year.
Again?
She said again?
Stupid bourgeois!
Is that like yogurt?
You said that you started working at a costume café...
Don't you need a good figure to pull that off?
Man...
I've been lamenting my lack of a chest for a while...
...but then this game said...
"A flat chest is a status symbol!
A rarity!"
Word for word.
And when you think about it...
...there is a demand, right?
Which means I'm valuable!
I want to know how a line from a game can fill her with confidence.
Then I guess I'm okay, too.
Honestly...
We have a test coming up.
Should you be gaming so much?
If you would only use some of that passion for studying...
Your grades would probably go up.
If she's so easily influenced...
...wouldn't she become a genius if
someone released a game that promoted studying?
There's already stuff like Moe Drill.
Something wrong?
There's been a lot of juvenile crimes lately.
Whenever that happens...
...all the neighbors say...
He was such a nice boy.
I never would have imagined that he could do such a thing.
Well...
That just means you can't judge a person on the surface.
If you ever commit a crime...
I always figured she would do something like this.
I'll tell the whole world.
Tired...
It's so hot that I don't feel like doing anything.
I really understand how you feel...
...but you never feel like doing anything.
H i i r a g i
Hello, Kagami.
Yo.
Making progress on your studying for the test?
I was tidying up my room.
You know how kinda get the urge to start
cleaning when you're feeling the pressure?
I can understand...
...but study.
Okay!
Let's get a little studying done today!
I'll take a thirty minute break.
I'm losing my concentration.
Time's already up.
Just thirty more minutes.
Thirty more minutes...
Isn't Haruhi about to start?
They definitely cut corners
with those long-winded Nagato scenes.
That Ya***** hasn't been very impressive recently.
They're already flaming away.
It's already two?
Not going to happen today.
I'll go to sleep and wake up early to study.
If I wake up at five...
...I can sleep three hours.
I ended up killing time yesterday by
reading manga and watching anime.
Sounds like something you would do.
Come to think of it...
You sure have some odd taste in manga and games.
You read manga aimed at boys...
...and mainly play dating sims for men.
My dad reads manga and plays games a lot...
...so I was probably influenced.
I've been watching him from the side since I was little.
I can understand the manga...
...but playing dating sims in front of your daughter?
What kind of father is he?
Doesn't your mom have anything to say...
...with both of you like this?
I don't have a mom.
She died when I was really little.
Really...
So I'm always doing housework...
...which is why I'm way better than Kagami is.
Don't say stuff like that...
...when the mood isn't right for comebacks.
Tsukasa's also good at cooking, right?
I'm not sure if I would say that I'm good...
...but I love it!
I wonder how good Miyuki-san is.
She looks rich...
...so maybe she's bad at housework.
Cooking, is it?
To be honest...
I only help out from time to time...
...so I'm not very skilled at housework.
It's quite embarrassing.
Oh! Knew it!
But Miyuki's so good at everything else...
...that it doesn't really feel the same.
You can't just assume that she's bad when she says so.
I see...
No, not at all...
Then what about our teacher?
I heard that she lives by herself...
...but she looks like she could be a slob.
These days...
...ya can get by without knowing how ta cook!
Ya got your convenience stores.
Just kiddin'!
I can cook.
About as well as your average person.
Please don't make jokes that sound like they're true.
Tsukasa still has my dictionary.
Tsukasa.
Sorry. Could I get my dictionary back?
I-I was doing a little cleaning for a change of pace...
...yeah...
You too, huh?
Yo.
What's up?
The people at work are trying to
come up with a new menu for summer.
So you do stuff like that, too...
And wait, did you give up on studying for the test?
Spicy stuff's good when it's hot outside...
...so how about super spicy ramen?!
Go with something you would usually find in a café.
Then a super spicy parfait!
Could you stop skipping the thinking process when you respond?
I can't stand...
Why doesn't our school have swimming class?
We have a pool...
I'm actually relieved by that fact.
Why's that?
To be honest...
I can't open my eyes underwater...
...so I can't really swim.
It's quite embarrassing.
Why can't I have all your "weaknesses"?!
The summer Comp Festival is finally about to begin!
That's right...
This is why I started working...
A festival...
You bring so many fond memories!
Why are you pulling out an ancient reference?
Man...
When the customers start getting excited with you...
...doesn't it feel like everyone's
pumped up together for the festival?
Use some of that passion on academic endeavors.
Having trouble getting to sleep.
Guess I'll read until I fall asleep.
I happen to have some stuff I just bought.
So much for falling asleep...
It's already morning.
And now...
...I'm feeling really sleepy...
Stare...
I can understand turning off your phone around priority seats...
Because of pacemakers and the like.
But why do they ban cell phone use for the whole train?
Because...
...you'll disturb other people when you talk?
But you know...
Aren't trains already noisy with people talking anyway?
That includes men and women of all ages.
I guess that's true...
Are you going to work at the temple
for summer festivals like you did for New Year's?
Nah.
I don't work in the summer.
Oh, yeah...
It's getting to be that time of year.
Huh?
Weren't you on a diet?
Nah.
Maybe it's because of all the studying...
When I weighed myself yesterday, it was down.
So I figured it'd be okay.
That was quick.
And like, you're weak.
Good morning!
Kona-chan, good morning!
Huh?
What's wrong with Kagami?
Konata!
My weight already...
...went all the way up in like the blink of an eye...
It's 'cause you let go and started snacking again.
And wasn't that a senryu?
My weight already
went all the way up in like
the blink of an eye
I only...
I only ate a little...
It's not like a kilo or two
is going to affect how you look.
Why do you get so excited and depressed over every kilogram?
This is why women are hopeless.
Aren't you supposed to be a woman?
Good lucky!
Welcome to another episode of Lucky Channel.
Has everyone been doing well?
I'm Akira Kogami, always running at 120%!
Today...
Nyoron!
Just kidding!
I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
Hey.
What?
Don't interrupt me!
I'm sorry!
This isn't a kiddy ride.
Learn the job already.
Do you want to be dropped from this role?
I'm terribly sorry!
I'll work hard!
Give it my all!
Okay!
Today...
Ta-da!
We have big news for everyone!
Published in the November issue of Comptiq...
Project Fashionable Akira!
I've already received this many postcards from everyone!
Uh.
I think there was another person involved in that project...
Thanks for all the feedback!
Like cowabunga!
I don't think anyone's going to understand a joke from the eighties...
Then I'll reveal the idea I've selected after extensive review.
Like this.
Um...
This is from a Miss Cherry in Satte, Saitama.
Project Fashionable Akira!
Kagami-san's pigtails look great on her.
What if Akira-san also wore pigtails?
Pigtails, huh...
Sounds—
Wonderful!
That's right.
Hair styling is a woman's life!
If I split it in two...
...it might look lovely...
No ifs or buts about it.
Isn't it impossible with your hair length...
But you know.
It's not like long hair is always a good thing.
Akira-sama.
It's gonna show.
It weighs a lot...
It's really gonna show.
Like if you just twitch!
It's a pain to maintain.
And frankly, it isn't in fashion right now.
Guys run their mouth off about liking long hair on women...
Uh.
...but do they have any idea how much
time, effort, and money it takes to maintain?
You're talking about yourself now.
Uh...
You're not in character anymore.
You're no longer Akira-sama.
And nobody ever notices your efforts...
Are you listening?
Hello?
It's already time to say goodbye!
As for what would Akira look like with pigtails...
You can find out more on our homepage or the radio show!
Hope to see you!
Both hands will be waiting!
I made a funny!
Then please look forward to next week.
What was with the attitude?
By attitude, you mean...
Why did you keep cutting in?
That upset about getting burned in the beginning?
No! Just that...
...I just figured nobody would recognize cowabunga now...
Ah, no.
Forgive me.
Uh...
Why don't we start over again?
You know?
Yes.
I heard they're holding an audition for Minoru Shiraishi.
Seriously?!
This is the first I've heard about it!
You can try out if you want.
Try out? Me?
Good for you.
But I'm actually him!
What?
You're amazing, Kona-chan!
You can sing anything!
As long as it's an anime song.
You can sing well...
...in many different voices.
Singing anime songs...
...is all about staying true to the original song.
Okay.
Guess I'll sing.
What are you gonna sing, Sis?
The title was displayed earlier...
...but I didn't recognize it.
Miyuki, you don't know this?
Guess you aren't any better.
I've heard this before!
Weren't you watching the series with me a while ago?
Really?
I still prefer the movie.
Are you an old geezer or something?
Farewell doesn't mean goodbye.
You're good.
Sis is the best singer out of us sisters.
Just a long promise until we meet again.
If you have any regrets left in the place where our dreams were...
...they'll only serve to chill your heart.
Just stay like this...
As many hours as we can...
I want to hold you in my arms.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Miyuki.
Golden Week...
...was apparently derived from industry lingo...
...for the period when movie ticket sales are extremely high.
Next time:
「Ace Shooter」
Ace Shooter.
Look forward to next time!
Summer time!
Beach time!
So Teacher and Cousin Yui are in
charge of supervising and driving today.
Gotcha!
But you know...
The two of you have a lot of free time.
Summer
Events
Sorry to impose on your day off.
It's nothing.
Don't sweat it.
Narumi-san...
You're an officer in the traffic safety department, right?
That's right.
I know all there is to know about traffic law.
He passed me.
Bastard...
Wa-
Hey!
What happened to safety first?
Cousin Yui goes wild once her hand's on the stick.
Guess we'll have to sacrifice Kagami and Tsukasa.
Really...
Isn't she a cop?
Huh?
That's odd.
I lost sight of them.
Teacher, that's the wrong way!
That's a one-way street!
I messed up big time!
I didn't expect them both to fail!
That car's incredible!
Who is it?!
They both have perfect braking and drifting!
It's practically on top of the FDI!
And it's got better acceleration!
It's practically touching the guard rail!
The point of attack will come...
...in the five consecutive hairpin curves ahead!
It's speeding up!
Did the brakes die?!
Incredible!
What's with the (bleep) D-like driving?!
Nanako-san...
You're really good...
...at driving...
Yeah?
You see...
I get sick whenever I'm in a car.
That's why I brought medicine...
But I didn't feel sick at all with you at the wheel.
Like!
I don't have time to be talking to you!
[Sign: To keep our city clean, fireworks are banned between 10 PM and 7 AM.]
Well...
How about we find a hotel?
The clear sky is perfect weather for a day at the beach.
Seriously...
I was getting worried there yesterday.
I'll put on my swimsuit before we go!
You're such a child...!
Konata-san!
Are you seriously wearing that?
And like...
I've never heard of someone wearing a school swimsuit at this age.
Some people have special needs, Kagamin.
Izumi
H-H-How old is that swimsuit?!
Besides...
Why are you wearing a swim ring when you're good at sports stuff?
The ocean doesn't exist solely for wasting effort on swimming.
You should take it leisurely.
Leisure time.
Plus, to meet those special needs...
...you have to wear a school swimsuit with a swim ring.
People with special needs...
...won't be coming to the beach.
Watermelon cracking is the usual event in manga and anime...
...but it doesn't happen much in reality.
I've seen it before...
...but people probably feel like it's a waste.
That's true...
If you blow up a watermelon with a gun...
...you'll end up covered in watermelon.
You watch too much anime.
Have you ever played it before, Miyuki-san?
Since you're rich.
I haven't.
Well, on second thought...
It doesn't seem like something rich people would do.
You have a point.
It was obvious...
...but I guess your eyes don't end up like in manga.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
But y'know, yeah?
A girls only babysitting trip to the beach at this age...
We're some lonely, single girls, huh?
You're mistak-
But yeah...
If the alternative is resorting to bringing something like that...
...I'm all for a girls only trip.
No, I'm...
They're telling people to marry late these days.
Might as well take our time and choose well.
You're mistaken.
My husband just happens to be busy working far away.
I'm already married!
The beach is a mecca for flirting...
...but it doesn't apply to us, huh?
Well, it's less annoying this way.
Besides, this thing...
...probably makes people think
we're sisters here on a family trip.
And a one-two.
What's up?
Well...
It kind of feels icky to sit down when I'm still wet.
I understand how you feel.
Then you can use an air chair.
You're pretty extreme.
Yakisoba
Yakiudon
Okonomiyaki
Ramen
Curry
Tokoyaki
Ikayaki
Fried Chicken
What is it?
My neck's tired.
Really now.
Just as expected!
What are you so happy about?
Because I got something straight out of a storybook beach house.
Look at how the curry is sauce and nothing else.
This is true beach house fare!
That's true.
Usually, you wouldn't be willing to eat something like this...
...but here, it actually tastes good!
The beer they got at the beach is the best!
Generic beer isn't too bad once in a while.
I find it odd that they're charging
300 yen for a single frankfurter.
Yeah!
Maybe they're only half-cooked.
But we'll eat it anyway.
I actually like how their chicken is...
...dripping in grease and over-spiced.
And this plain fried soba...
...is quite nice.
But still...
You couldn't stand eating this stuff at home!
Konata's touched.
Hey.
Does this food really warrant so much praise?
Not really.
Not enough to make you run towards the ocean in a loincloth.
Is that another anime reference?
Drank too much...
No choice.
Let's stay another night.
What about work, Cousin Yui?
I also took tomorrow off.
It's fine!
I-It's freezing...
You're such a kidder, Teacher.
Why is your hair all squeaky...
...after you've been in the ocean?
Dunno.
Maybe it has to do with salt or something.
Right, Miyuki?
That's right.
The main reason would be salt content and UV rays.
What's so bad about it?
Isn't your hair always getting hit by UV rays?
Well...
It'll take a little while...
...to explain that.
In that case...
The reason your hair is damaged by a trip to the beach...
...would be the adhesion of salt
from seawater and the sea breeze...
...which absorbs the moisture from your hair...
...which now suffers from exposure to strong UV rays.
Also...
Whenever you are exposed to strong UV rays outdoors...
...your melanin levels will fade...
...and your hair will become light brown.
And if residual quantities of salt or chlorine remain in your hair...
...they may result in the discoloration of your hair.
The usual reason for hair damage in summer...
...would be UV rays and residual substances.
The above factors cause damage to the cuticles.
When exposed to strong UV rays...
...the cysteine molecules found in strong hair are broken up...
Look! Look!
Timotei!
Timotei!
Timotei!
What's that?
I wonder how other people would see us.
Not sure...
Nothing to talk about...
Probably sisters or cousins?
Probably.
That's all you have to say?
Cousin Yui!
Timotei!
Timotei!
Timotei!
I remember that!
I used to do it!
Yes!
That's the response I wanted!
How old are you?
Mandom!
Cut out the geezer jokes.
What's wrong, Kona-chan?
I just triggered a flag.
What are you talking about?
This is where the event starts!
In order to see both paths...
...don't forget to save often before a split!
No exceptions!
Picture complete.
Perfect!
Bring it on!
No idea what's going on.
Anyway...
...you being like this is why...
Why...?
Why nobody came to hit on us.
Y-You're the one who brought it up in the first place!
I could really care less about that stuff.
So Kagami wanted someone to hit on her.
N-No...
No!
Damn it!
I missed it!
What is it?
I was wondering what you do about hair.
Mine's pretty smooth, so I don't do anything.
What about you, Sis?
M-Me?!
I guess I'm normal.
Actually, today was kinda dangerous.
What?
Well...
You know...
Almost happened...
Oh, that?
I see.
Good thing then.
You were okay?
No problem at all.
Mine ended a week ago.
The timing was perfect.
It really sucks when that happens.
You're right.
It would be sad if you were the
only one who couldn't go in the water...
But using that would be a little...
Yeah.
Makes you think twice.
I've never used one.
That was a candid conversation.
Wh-What about you?
Don't tell me...
What's with that look?
Nothing.
Apparently, this is a true story...
A photo software wholesaler...
...was on his way home from work...
...and got on the bus as usual late at night...
His house was...
...at the end of the bus line.
So...
As more and more passengers got off...
...eventually, he was the only person left on the bus...
The driver thought that nobody was left on the bus...
...and...
...sang "DANZEN! Futari wa ***Cure" at the top of his lungs!
Just a rumor I heard.
It was nothing...
What a relief...
I was so scared.
I'm also...
I'm Sukekiyo.
Where'd you get that mask from?!
Then good night.
Yes.
Good night.
The Inugami Family!
It's so much fun to scare you.
Go to sleep already.
Hey!
We're going!
Okay!
I don't have anything interesting to say.
I'm Tsukasa.
I'm Tsukasa.
Sis!
What is it?
I was scared!
A girl just took a step towards becoming an adult, Kagamin.
Comp Festival is a big hit.
'Cause Japanese people are suckers for limited edition stuff.
If the words "limited edition" are enough to boost sales...
...they could just add it to everything.
That would cheapen the value.
So I went and asked.
Yes.
Clean your room before break's over.
Whoa, flashback!
These textbooks are from middle school.
Sis!
Look at this album!
Isn't this picture of Dad a little risqué?
Right?
That's when I started wondering about Dad's thing.
You look like you're having fun...
...but are you getting any cleaning done?
Um...
Hey.
Do you want these clothes?
If you don't need them, I'll take them.
Then I'll leave them here.
Thanks.
Hey.
Do you want this?
Then I guess I'll take it.
What about this?
This?
Wait!
Don't tell me I'm her trash can...
You end up looking through photo albums and stuff instead.
I know what you mean.
If any old magazines are lying around, I start reading them.
That's right.
Oh, yeah. What about Tsukasa?
She doesn't throw anything away, so it takes a while.
She's still at it.
Tsukasa's always slow to act.
On the other hand, Kagami's always trigger happy.
Why is your impression of me...
...so aggressive?
You saved your textbooks from middle school.
You don't have anything like that?
I left them with my memories at my old school.
No, take them home.
You're causing trouble for the school.
I finally finished cleaning.
I don't think that I'll ever use this again...
...but then I remember how I just used it...
...so I can't throw it away.
Yeah.
There really are people who keep everything.
Tsukasa seems the type.
You seem like someone who even throws away useful stuff.
Seeing as how you ditched your textbooks.
Miyuki.
Go have your teeth taken care of...
...before school starts up again.
I understand...
...but I just don't like it.
Well, I would feel bad about forcing you to go.
If you can't go...
...I'll have him come.
A visit from the dentist.
P-Please wait!
Good lucky!
We've already burst into the sixth episode of Lucky Channel!
I hope that you've all become familiar with this corner.
I'm Akira Kogami!
Lame!
You say something?
It appears that newbie Shiraishi-kun
isn't used to the job and is a nervous wreck.
I'm scared...
So scared...
You're all making his heart race.
Whad did I do wrong?
We went to the mountains 'cause Akira-sama said so.
I hope he gets used to the job soon.
Yeah.
Went to the beach, too.
And he better watch how he talks to the
veterans around here or else something may happen.
I'm doing everything I can to make this show funnier!
Yeah...
The gum was hard...
I just hate that!
But it was fifty-four pieces.
Today we'll introduce a key Lucky Star character...
Fifty-four pieces in my mouth!
But I still worked hard!
Konata Izumi-san!
What else will I have to do?
Hey.
Stop blubbering.
Why me?!
Let's see...
Konata Izumi-san.
Seventeen years old.
Her hobbies are gaming, watching anime, and reading.
Uh...
According to the data...
...she always checks out new shows and books.
She games up a storm on weekends.
So she's a geek.
Uh...
Looks like it...
Come up with something quick!
By geek, you mean that, right?
People who watch House Classics, right?
The ones who watch A Dog of Flanders and cry, right?
Which decade of geek are you talking about?
Are you doing your homework?!
Get with the program!
N-No, uh...
Well I guess A Dog of Flanders had the
whole cutesy, appealing character to soothe you.
But people these days prefer a girl like me!
Cute as a button and pure as snow!
You know what I mean?
If I look right, so do you!
If I look left, so do you!
When you line up for my concert the
night before, you can't take a shower!
That may cause hygienic problems...
...but you still want to see me!
That determination burns as hot as the sun in wait of my arrival!
Until the bandana around your head is drenched!
You know...
They're still customers.
When I'm doing handshakes afterward, they won't stop talking.
Yapping away during MC without reading the crowd.
Doesn't that just blow?
I'm only here because of them.
I have to work hard for them.
Y'know?
Is that how it is...
You'll know soon enough.
How hard it is to be an idol...
Once you've been through the
good and bad, you'll see how it really is.
Can't do anything about fans or clients you hate...
Perfect timing!
Hey, everybody!
Do you know who Konata-san is now?
Then we'll see you on next week's Lucky Channel!
Bye-bee!
Uh...
You didn't even introduce Konata...
More like you introduced geeks.
A-Akira-sama?
You okay?
Do it.
Understood!
What the correspondent saw then was...
Not funny.
Kage sure is awesome.
We get the idea.
So did you order a song, Tsukasa?
I did.
Tsukasa-san singing will be quite refreshing.
I wonder if I can sing it well.
What are you going to sing, Miyuki?
I really don't know many songs...
It's quite embarrassing.
So she went with this, huh?
Go for it, Tsukasa-san!
Tomorrow will be a special, SPECIAL DAY!
A once-in-a-year CHANCE!
OH DARLING!
L!
O!
V!
E!
Lovely!
Tsukasa!
OH DARLING!
Hey, now.
L!
O!
I LOVE YOU!
V!
E!
Lovely!
Sayuri!
Who's that?
Everybody's happy about the CARNIVAL!
I'm gonna make his HEART mine!
OH BABY!
Her name isn't Sayuri Kuninama, right?
OH BABY!
So who is she already?!
What member number was she?
Oh, when I give to you...
...sweet, sweet chocolate of love.
I still won't stand out.
Shut up already!
So I'm gonna resort to my last card!
VALENTINE DAY KISS!
VALENTINE DAY KISS!
VALENTINE DAY KISS!
With a ribbon tied on.
Sha-la-la-la!
Wonderful...
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Kagami.
When you try to get rid of a hanging nail...
...and give it a little tug...
...but then you end up pulling off too much...
...it really hurts, doesn't it?
Also...
...there's the timing for ripping off a scab.
When it starts to itch...
...and you're thinking that it's about time...
...so you pick it off bit by bit.
And just when you're like everything is good...
...it still ends up bleeding!
It leaves some serious damage.
Next time:
Image.
「Image」
Look forward to next time!
I haven't put on my uniform in a while.
It's Kona-chan.
Kona-chan!
Good morning!
My...
Kagami-san.
Tsukasa-san.
A very good day to you.
Why, Tsukasa-san...
Your ribbon is crooked.
Thanks.
Gonna hurl.
What brought this on, Kona-chan?
Yes.
I have become hooked on Marimite.
Marimite?
Are you a kid?!
Image
Hey...
Don't start copying their costumes, too.
Um...
Is that called cosplay?
I wouldn't go that far.
You mean it, right?
I already do plenty of that at work.
Oh, yeah...
You work at one of those places...
But if Kona-chan was a high-class lady...
Feels so wrong that I can't even picture it.
Baseball games have been going over schedule too much recently.
Why do the people watching new anime get shafted?
If you want to watch anime that badly...
...you could get cable or something.
Aren't there specialized channels for that stuff?
If I could...
God knows I want to...
But the cable guys were all like...
You can't get cable...
Yuki-chan.
Good morning.
Good morning, Tsukasa-san.
You look kinda down, did something happen?
Actually, I went to have my cavity taken care of.
You went to the dentist.
Impressive!
Why are there so many follow-up trips
after a visit to the dentist?
I totally know what you mean!
And it isn't just one or two trips!
Miyuki-san.
Good day.
Konata-san.
Good day.
Have you been well?
Thank you for asking.
I'm pleased to see you looking well.
Yuki-chan's so amazing.
She's talking the same way...
...but it doesn't feel weird at all.
And she isn't even questioning the way Kona-chan's talking.
This is the first time I've seen a person say "good day" in real life!
Really?
It appears to be a regularly used greeting...
...at the girls' school my friends go to.
A real school for rich girls is something else.
How refined.
Kuroi...
...told me to collect summer homework for her.
Excellent work, Sebastian.
S-Seba—
Butlers must be named Sebastian, do you not agree?
You do get that impression.
Tell us a funny story, Sebastian.
Ain't happening!
Okay.
Vacation just ended...
...but you got no time to be mooching around.
Schedule
for
Second Semester
Start thinking about your future...
...and put effort into studying.
By future, does she mean choosing a major?
I guess high school is only a temporary stopping point.
But you probably haven't done
much thinking about the future, right?
Why?
Don't insult me!
'Cause...
You chose liberal arts to be in the
same class with everyone else, right?
Tsu-Tsukasa!
You blabbed!
Ah, sorries.
And you told her...
...o-of all people!
Come on...
You should have just been honest.
You hate being lonely, don't you?
There, there.
Shut up!
Hey!
I'm back!
Cousin Yui...
For my summer homework...
I did as you told me and wrote down
random stuff when I didn't know the answer...
...and now I have to redo it all!
Save me!
O-Okay...
But...
If you get help from me, you might have to redo it again...
...if you know what I mean...
She got out of it...
An extension on homework without
an extension on summer vacation...
Maybe I should borrow Kagami's notes.
The sound of cicadas puts me to sleep.
Huh?
I see...
The schedule's off because the baseball game went over.
I guess it can be useful sometimes.
My recorder's off!
Huh?
Where are your glasses, Yuki-chan?
Actually...
They broke this morning...
I forgot that I left them on the chair...
...and accidentally...
I'm terribly sorry...
...but could I borrow your notes for today later?
Sure.
You still got the clumsy thing going.
Konata's Notes
Konata-san...
Horrible handwriting.
So hard to read.
Your handwriting is a mystery to me.
Tsukasa's Notes
Tsukasa-san...
So detailed that
she didn't get
everything down
Hang in there!
They sure are useless.
Here.
Thank you so much.
Good thing we have the same teacher.
Um...
But please keep this a secret...
I don't wish to ruin their good intentions...
I'm starving!
Yuki-chan!
Let's have lunch!
Tsukasa-san.
Konata-san.
Thank you for letting me use your notes.
Nah.
No need to thank us.
I never expected Yuki-chan to borrow my notes.
Well...
It's not happening again.
STARE
U-Um...
Is there something on my face?
In games, when a character who wears
glasses shows up at school without them...
...they suddenly become popular...
But I guess that doesn't happen in real life.
I-It really doesn't.
Unfortunately.
Don't chocolate cornets kinda look like drills?
D-Drills...
D-Didn't we discuss which side of a chocolate cornet was the head?
Like how the thin end looked like the bottom.
On second thought...
...the fat end looks more like the bottom.
Bottom?
That's one big bottom...
And layers of stomach.
When the lower half of your body gains weight...
...it becomes difficult to buy skirts and the like.
That's right!
If you use your waist measurements, you can't get it over your hips.
If it fits your hips perfectly, it's loose around your waist.
You have no choice but to buy one that's too big for your waist...
...and when you walk around in it,
your skirt starts spinning, doesn't it?
That's right!
A body with layers of stomach looks like a cornet...
If you turn it on the side...
...you can play it like a cornet.
If you turn it again, you can...
...put it on your head like a cornet.
Was that supposed to be funny?
Weren't you dieting to make up
for your added summer weight, Sis?
But my weight went down...
...without my waist or hips changing.
No, Kagami.
I can see the fruits of your diet.
Really?
It's plain to see.
They say that when you diet, you lose
weight in the places you don't want to first.
Okay already!
Stop right there!
When reading literature...
...the trick is to keep the theme in mind...
...and understand what the author is trying to convey.
I get it...
I heard that people with poor eyesight end up
with nasty expressions that scare other people...
...but I guess...
...it depends on the person.
Hey, you!
When you said it depends on the person...
...you glanced over at me, didn't you?!
I've heard that thinner eyes make you look prettier.
It makes you look more mature.
Hey.
Stop that!
She's late!
Stupid Konata...
What's she doing?
She's here!
Sorry!
I'm late.
Way late!
Someone who's always complaining
about night games lasting too long...
...shouldn't be so loose with time!
Well, you know...
All the games have been going over schedule lately, so...
I guess it infected me.
Like it's contagious!
So?
Why were you late?
Overslept?
No way.
I'm not a child.
Then give me an adult reason for why you were late.
Well...
There was still plenty of time left when I finished getting ready...
So to kill time...
...I started playing games and couldn't stop...
You suck.
You're worse than a child.
Oh, yeah.
There are a bunch of cultural festivals and
sporting events during second semester, right?
And we have tests soon.
Kona-chan is really athletic so she can do well in sporting events.
I don't like sporting events 'cause they make me tired.
Pretty rare to see such a lazy athletic type.
I wonder what our class will do for the cultural festival.
There isn't anything I'd want to do.
These things...
...can never be decided...
...unless someone wants to do something.
And the person who brings up the idea usually gets put in charge...
...so nobody's willing to talk.
And you have to stay after school to prepare.
You won't be able to watch evening anime.
Knew you'd say that.
It's my turn to cook dinner tonight.
Have to stop by the store on the way home.
What are you going to make?
Everyone's favorite chicken curry!
Everyone in our family loves chicken.
Curry, huh?
Sounds good.
I've heard that letting curry sit overnight makes it taste better.
It works well.
Then I'll make some extra and bring it for lunch tomorrow.
Since there'll be leftovers anyway.
Yes.
This is the Hiiragi residence.
Tsukasa?
Kona-chan!
Why are you calling so early?
The curry...
Curry?
The curry I made yesterday...
I let it sit overnight, and now it's spoiled.
No way.
Really.
Why?
Curry usually doesn't go bad in one day.
Right?
Did you put in anything weird?
I didn't.
But...
...there was mold in it this morning!
So?
Another cornet today?
They taste good, so it's okay.
If you say so...
Oh, yeah...
I just noticed...
...but the difference between when your lunches are...
Mini Hamburger Patties
Fried Eggs
Bacon Sauté
with broad beans and onions.
Salted Asparagus
and Carrots
Made
Properly
...made properly...
Made
Frugally
Grilled Salmon
Okra
(Just boiled and sliced)
Pickled Vegetables
And nothing else...
...or made frugally...
...is really obvious.
Ts-Tsukasa and I take turns making lunch...
I'm not good with housework...
So, it always ends up being simple!
Well, sorry that's the case!
What?!
So you're the type of person...
...who can blow up pots when they cook?!
Nobody in the world can do that.
Yuki-chan's lunch looks wonderful again today.
Not at all.
Today's lunch is just leftovers from last night.
Dinner at Miyuki-san's place...
Is really fancy...
And these are just the leftovers.
Um...
What's inside these fried eggs?
We had some eel leftover last night, so I added it in.
You don't usually see leftovers for eel.
The only thing that's ever leftover at our house is moldy curry.
Your house isn't normal.
Good morning.
Good morning!
Yo!
Look! Look!
My parents bought me a cell phone!
Good for you.
'Cause I did well on my practical exams for once.
Give me your number.
I'll give you mine.
What is my number again?
Um...
Hold on a second!
Um... Um...
Konata.
You have a cell phone?
But I usually forget it at home.
Since Dad's the only one who ever calls.
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having a cell phone?
You think?
Keroro!
Isn't it cute?
They bought it for me with the cell phone.
Oh, yeah...
There was a girl in our class who
had a bunch of straps on her phone.
They weighed it...
...and the straps alone were 800 grams.
That much?
That's heavy, man.
Once she took the straps off...
...her stiff shoulders were cured.
Sounds like making a phone call would count as weight training.
Isn't it exciting how you never know
when you'll get a call on your cell phone?
Really?
I hope someone calls me soon!
There's no need to get so excited over a cell phone nowadays.
By the way, did you find your number yet?
Not yet!
In England...
...there was a large struggle between the
House of Lancaster and the House of York.
The two houses fought wearing red and white roses respectively.
Thus, this war was known as the War of Roses.
It lasted from 1455 to 1485.
This...
M-Mine?!
It's my phone!
Somebody finally called me!
Who's this?
Okay.
Confiscated.
Pick it up in the faculty office after school.
What a relief!
She gave it back!
But junk mail already?
Dad?
Still at school.
I was talking with Konata and Miyuki and lost track of time.
It's okay.
We'll be home soon.
Bye.
Just a little late and look what happens.
Yes?
Dad?
I'm still at school.
I'm with Kona-chan and everyone.
You'd think he'd get the idea after calling one of us.
Fathers are always worried about their daughters.
We sure get a lot of junk mail these days.
It's better to make your address hard to guess.
That's how I did it.
Hard to guess?
In what way?
My e-mail address is in roman letters.
iluvgiriswithglasses.
I wanted to go with maids or something...
But maids and shrine maidens are popular and easily...
Hold it right there!
We get it already...
...so don't talk so loudly around the general public.
Your conversation is a bigger problem than the junk mail!
Good morning!
Yo!
What's wrong, Tsukasa?
My cell phone...
My cell phone...!
She left it in her pocket...
It's gone to a better place, huh...
I wonder if they'll buy me another one...
This boy was safe.
Tenacious little guy.
Then the e-mail last night...
The one that said Kagami wanted her notes back...
That was the last one you sent?
Yep.
Did you reply?
Um...
You never respond immediately when you get an e-mail, do you?!
I don't reply to people I can talk to whenever I want.
Reply to e-mails through e-mail.
We see each other every day.
What's the point?
You're going to lose your friends.
Oh, well.
Wasn't that big a deal anyway.
Don't decide that on your own!
And she didn't return my notes.
Tsukasa!
I'm coming in!
Sis.
Wh-What is it?
What's wrong?
This manga I borrowed from Kona-chan moved me to tears.
Good morning!
Thanks for the manga, Kona-chan!
It was great!
Wasn't it so stupid and hilarious?
I-It moved me to tears!
I find it hard to believe you're talking about the same manga.
Here.
If you cry, you're with Tsukasa.
If you laugh, you're with me.
I'm not gonna read it!
I don't want to be classified with either of you.
But I wanna see how Sis reacts.
Is it wrong to want to know more about your friends?
In that case...
Did Attack No. 1 make you cry or laugh?
Laugh.
Cry.
Then what's your favorite manga?
Sgt. Frog.
I can't tell if these two are similar or not...
Why don't you join a manga club, Kona-chan?
Since you love manga.
Well, I'd be willing to do it...
And it'd be a good use of time...
Draw. Draw. Draw. Draw.
D-Did you even try on this?!
Incidentally, Konata-san...
What is this a picture of?
This is Tsukasa.
This was me!
This is Miyuki-san.
Well, I could really stretch and say that you captured her spirit...
This is Kagami.
So I can breathe fire.
My...
It fits Kagami-san's image so perfectly.
What a frightening child.
Cut that out already!
There's a new volume of FMP out.
Right, I guess there's a release date coming up.
I'm heading to Gamers.
Wanna come along?
Sorry.
I'll just stop by a local bookstore today.
I have some other stuff to take care of.
You're supposed to come with me as a sign of our friendship!
What is it?
You sure are clingy today.
Besides, you shouldn't be using words like friendship.
Well, you know...
I wanted you to give me your
purchase points as a sign of our friendship.
So that's your idea of friendship.
I can almost get
the item I want
You've waited so long for me!
It's quiet...
Is she mad about how I mixed up the
ribbons on my pigtails with sunflowers?
Me?
Me?!
To Akira-sama?
You sure?
Understood.
Uh.
Uh...
It started already...
No choice!
Before they change the channel...
Go—
Good lucky!
Just kidding!
Just wanted to say it.
W-Well, we're on another episode of Lucky Channel!
I'm Minoru Shiraishi!
Akira-sama's in a bad mood so...
You said your own name before Akira Kogami.
Do you not understand what natural order is?
No, that's...
Looks like those pigtails of yours have been
getting ridiculously popular in certain places.
I-I wouldn't call it popular...
Don't be getting full of yourself!
I'm terribly sorry!
Besides...
People were expecting Project
Fashionable Akira to show me in pigtails, right?
So what's this?
It's just as you say!
I'll go with twin drills!
T-Twin drills?!
Don't underestimate the Getter's speed.
No. 2, huh?
The age of pigtails is over!
The new thing is twin drills!
Isn't that what Konata said?
Drills are like a man's romance.
Is it now...
Well, everybody!
You can catch the rest of this on
the radio show and our home page!
L-Look forward to next time.
Bye-bee!
Say...
Yes?
About those pigtails...
Ah, the ones I had?
The ones in the real life picture.
Yes?
You had sunflowers on, right?
I did.
That looked awfully familiar...
You can't mean...
How many years ago was it?
H-Hold on a sec!
In one of my...
Eew! Eew!
I was so nervous.
It was cute and wonderful.
Isn't it so nerve-wracking when you're singing your first song?
You wonder if your voice can be heard and stuff.
Miyuki's next, right?
Sing us something full of memories.
Why?
May I have the mic?
Here.
Go for it!
Um, I'm not used to this kind of thing.
Please forgive me if it offends your ears.
Don't worry.
Go for it!
Manly.
I get it.
This ties in to the other Miyuki.
PLEIADS IS IN THE WIND.
Even her singing is manly.
THE MILKY WAY IS IN THE SAND.
Is this a new kind of moe?
You're so cool, Yuki-chan!
WHERE HAS EVERYONE GONE?
I NEVER SAID GOODBYE.
PEGASUS IS IN THE PRAIRIE.
VENUS IS ON THE STREET CORNER.
WHERE HAS EVERYONE GONE?
I CAN NO LONGER WATCH OVER THEM.
NOBODY REMEMBERS THE STARS ON THIS PLANET.
PEOPLE ALWAYS LOOK UP AT THE SKY.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Tsukasa.
Er, I'm already out of time?!
「Don't Need Me
to Have a Blast」
Next time:
Don't Need Me to Have a Blast.
Look forward to next time!
Perfect Weather for
Athletic Festivals
On this day...
...the sunniest day in autumn...
...athletic festivals are being held all over the country.
Fathers and Brothers
Enjoying Athletic Festivals
Man...
I came to cheer for my daughter...
...but I didn't expect such a turnout.
This was worth the trip.
Fathers and Brothers
Enjoying Athletic Festivals
I got some great pictures.
Look.
Dad.
Isn't this a great shot?
If you put it like this...
Which daughter are you talking about?
Don't Need Me
to Have a Blast
Maybe I should cut my hair for the athletic festival.
Go for a really short look.
You're going to cut your hair?
But it took forever to grow it so long.
I wasn't that serious about it...
That profound response...
...must have something to do with a guy!
Stop connecting everything to that subject!
And you stop talking so much!
But if Kagami cut her hair...
That's what I heard...
...but it's not unusual, right?
Ya can't!
Bipolar girls hafta have twin pigtails!
Sorry I have a boring face!
Oh, yeah.
The athletic festival's coming up.
Sounds like a pain.
Wouldn't expect to hear that from a young person.
Kona-chan's good at sports, so she's okay...
...but someone like me...
...just drags everyone down.
Don't worry.
What event are you doing, Sis?
Well, it's Kagami, so you know...
A bread eating contest.
I've been wondering...
Are you trying to pick a fight or something?
So what are you going to do, Kagami?
I guessed right?
Did I guess right?
She pisses me off!
So I plan on doing some
independent training for the athletic festival.
Since fall is for sports.
But are you really training for the athletic festival?
Aren't you actually training for the main event afterwards?
What do you mean?
You want me to say it?
She really pisses me off!
So Miyuki's participating in the inter-class relay.
Well, I can understand that one.
She was originally supposed to be in the obstacle course.
Ball Roll
5m Dash
50m Dash
100m Dash
Obstacle Course
Matsuo
Shiraishi
Yamata
Izumi
Takara
Okay.
No more candidates, right?
I've never tried it so, I can't wait.
That's no good, Miyuki-san!
Your body sticks out too much for an obstacle course.
You'd have to go through stuff.
After I said that, she was switched to the relay.
Isn't that something a middle-aged guy would say?
Oh, yeah.
Did you guys ever have a scavenger race in middle school?
Sure did.
I was called up once...
Me?
For what?
...but he never told me what the criteria were.
Too many unspeakable things come to mind.
Well, just ask Miyuki-san when you don't know the answer.
Don't ask her something like that.
It's impossible to answer.
And she really went and asked...
A character trait that would come up in a scavenger race...
...that people wouldn't want to tell you about?
Perhaps he needed a person with a mole on her face.
Some people are sensitive about that.
I guess it was expected...
...but that was one masterful dodge.
But I'm pretty sure she's wrong.
I enjoy athletic festivals...
...but we have tests right after.
Once the festival's over...
...there aren't any more events, which is kind of sad.
Midterms.
Practical exams.
Finals.
All we have are tests.
The second semester is a drain on your energy with events like the cultural festival and the athletic festival.
Right?
Midterms are particularly rough.
They also say that fall is for reading...
...so maybe I should read something.
It's also a good season to study for tests.
And there's a whirlwind of new game releases before Christmas!
But finals come first.
Oh, yeah!
You two.
Could you stop trying to avoid reality?
I see.
The athletic festival's coming up, huh?
You know about the starter's pistol?
I thought it was a real gun until middle school.
No way...
That was when I knew I wanted to be a cop.
That misunderstanding led to something totally unrelated.
That's right, Konata.
When's the athletic festival at your school?
This Sunday.
Th-This Sunday?!
Why didn't you tell me such an important thing earlier?
But we just got the notice today.
There's no time to waste!
Why's he in such a hurry?
Okay!
Today's the big day!
Show me the fruits of your training!
Teacher!
I'm the type who does well without ever training!
Don't say that out loud!
Anyway, you better give it your all
in the team chicken fight!
The fundamental strategy is to rush
in from all sides and whack 'em good!
So attack from their weak side, right?
But we only need to take their hat...
Hitting people's kinda...
Don't sweat the little stuff.
That's one of those mistakes of youth.
So we're just little runts.
Sis!
Do your best!
Good luck!
Hey.
[ anpan – a Japanese sweet bun most commonly filled with red bean paste. ]
How is that anpan attached to the string?
It's probably attached to a clip or something.
So you can't take it off very easily.
Bring us victory!
Girls must be elegant!
Like an eating contest could ever be elegant!
Ready!
She did it!
That's Kagamin for you.
That person has an incredible camera.
Man, he's so easy to understand.
Hey.
Aren't you in the 100 meter dash next?
Technically.
How can I learn to run fast like you?
It's important to visualize.
Visualize.
Ready!
Set!
That's one ancient visualization.
Goal!
Like that?
Are you serious?
3 meters and 25 centimeters.
So they measure from where your hands reached.
This is it!
That's Kagami.
Dived straight into the sand, huh?
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
I've heard that timing your steps is important for hurdles.
Steps?
One.
Two.
Three.
I get it!
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Set!
One...
Um...
Three, two, three!
One, three, huh?
Um...
I started with my right foot so...
I don't get it!
That was my left foot, so...
Three, three, three.
Three, two, three...
She's knocking every single one down.
You could say she's got talent.
I totally sucked.
Man...
I told you.
I thought my daughter was in this.
A common occurrence.
It's finally time for the last relay.
Yuki-chan!
Do your best!
No...
I told you that my daughter's...
I'll do my best!
Hold on a second!
I haven't even done anything yet!
Okay!
Go for it!
Pedal to the metal!
Awesome!
We're in second!
Not bad.
Sachi, over here!
Okay!
Okay!
We've fallen to third.
This is what you call a race.
Keep at it!
Okay!
They're working pretty hard.
This is getting interesting.
Will Yuki-chan be okay?
Okay.
Okay!
Okay!
Go, Miyuki!
Yay!
Yuki-chan's so cool!
That's our Miyuki-san.
Didn't forget to give the spectators some eye candy.
It's Tsukasa.
Oh, well.
H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne...
Hey!
Can you do something about that?
Sorry.
I chose to play the alto part in a quartet for music class...
...but my fingers are getting numb.
Why did you choose the alto part?
I-I thought the lower part might be easier.
Why don't you condition your fingers on an easy song for now?
You missed most of the notes.
So try to match me.
Ready and...
H-Hold on!
Play by yourself.
Seems wrong somehow...
Try blowing a little softer.
If you relax, it might go a lot better.
I see.
Softer...
That's it.
I'll give it a try.
Isn't she doing more breathing than playing?
I was thinking we should try the cafeteria occasionally...
...but it sure is crowded.
It's pretty overwhelming.
And waiting in line is annoying and exhausting.
Sure sucks.
Haven't you gotten used to this kind of thing from those events?
When I'm not eagerly anticipating what
awaits me at the end of the line, it sucks.
True to your desires, huh?
That's right.
I went to a theme park once...
...and thought that I had lined up for an attraction...
...but the line was for the restroom.
It's a fundamental rule to check what the line is for first.
And I waited two whole hours...
I've also gotten in line a few times...
...and when it was finally my turn...
...the person before me had bought the last one.
Cream Puffs
Sold Out
Terrible...
Don't even wanna picture it.
You're just unlucky.
Look, everyone.
What shall we have today?
Well, I guess I'll go with curry.
Fox
Soba/Udon
Miso
Ramen
Soy Sauce
Ramen
Curry
S M L
Daily Special
A Meal
Daily Special
B Meal
Eggs
Special
They can't screw it up...
I'll go with ramen.
Me too.
I was planning on having miso ramen today.
With lots of corn...
...and seaweed, too!
Kagami's probably having ramen, pudding, and an éclair.
If I have enough room to eat more.
You always have more room.
What about you, Yuki-chan?
I'll have a sandwich.
With strawberries.
Sounds like something you would have.
Right?
By the way...
Isn't a strawberry sandwich considered dessert?
Would it count as lunch?
Th-That's true...
You pick some odd issues to be concerned about.
What about those chocolate cornets you always have?
Wouldn't sweet pastries be considered dessert?
Stupid Tsukasa ruining the punch line.
Anyway, moving on...
Unfortunately, Miyuki-san...
The line for sandwiches is over there.
Typical behavior.
Walking is healthy.
Look.
It's your turn, Kona-chan.
Curry please.
With extra sauce.
Okay.
You're pretty shrewd.
I'll take what I can get.
Okay.
Next person?
Soy sauce ramen please.
With hard noodles.
Okay, please wait one moment.
Okay.
Here's your curry.
I'll go get a table.
Countin' on you.
Thanks!
Let's see...
Next person?
Yes.
Can I please have miso ramen?
Sorry.
The last person ordered the last of our noodles.
We're out of ramen.
Say.
If you're okay with soy sauce, do you want mine?
I'm okay with fox udon.
Thank you, Sis.
Hey, Sis.
You're the older sister because you came out first, right?
Yeah.
I was thinking that it's a good thing I'm the younger sister.
Why?
Because an older sister shouldn't be asking a
younger sister for help with homework and stuff.
I'm pretty sure that copying homework
has nothing to do with that.
Besides, we're twins.
Neither of us is really older or younger.
Stop worrying...
...and do your homework.
But if I were the older sister...
...and all dependable and responsible...
Sis!
Show me your homework!
Again?
You're so hopeless, Kagami.
Hey.
That was too crazy!
You okay there?
Get a grip.
I did it!
Newtype...
...published my...
...very own...
...postcard!
In the May issue...
Saitama province.
The one that has Akira-chan standing on Shiraishi.
Konata Izumi.
Good for you.
Look at it!
Kinda amazed they published this.
A-Amazing!
What a surprise!
This is pretty rare, yeah?
Like, seriously, huh?
Now I have one more thing to look forward to buying!
You don't need to praise me so much!
1,260 yen...
...and 567 yen, huh?
I'll have enough points after one more book.
Then I should just get something...
No.
Then I'd be falling into their trap.
I'm not so easy to fool.
That would be an unplanned purchase for the sake of points.
That's their strategy.
I'm not dumb enough to fall for that trick.
Oh!
I forgot that the fifth volume was out.
Okay!
This works!
Genius
Your total comes to 2,587 yen.
Oh, well.
Extra, yeah...
I can't get it loose.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to let go.
I thought that only ever happened in manga or games...
...but it actually happens in real life.
Guess so.
Which means...
Those two definitely triggered a flag.
Konata...
Fantasy refers to the world of illusion.
Can you not tell the difference
between dreams and reality?
Good lucky!
I come with a dreamer's heart to spread love again!
I'm Lucky Channel's navigator, Akira Kogami!
And I'm the assistant.
Minoru Shiraishi.
We've already reached the eighth episode of this program.
That's true.
If we don't come up with some fresh material...
...we'll be accused of abusing mannerisms.
What was that?
What am I doing?!
No.
I just wanted to try some new things...
You said it.
You know...
Do it.
That's right!
I was walking around town the other day...
...and someone came up to talk to me.
Was it some salon doing a survey?
Geez, Shiraishi-san.
Do you actually mean that?
Of course, it was a fan.
This would never happen to you...
Right?!
I-I-I-I-It wouldn't!
That's true...
Right?!
You're the assistant...
Right?!
Well, keep workin' hard.
B-But...
I've already received this many...
...fan letters!
H-How?!
Hey, Itou!
Haven't I gotten any?!
Incredible.
I feel like a real voice actor.
So I did get some.
Only one?
Your membership has almost expired...
Hey!
This is that stupid online service!
Everybody who's watching!
Please send me fan letters, too!
Big, big, big recruitment drive!
Akira-sama.
Shouldn't we get to today's topic...
Don't get too cocky.
You're easily replaceable.
I'm so sorry.
Ta-da!
I have an announcement to make!
Wow!
We'll be creating figures on this program!
Akira-sama!
The clipboard!
The clipboards upside-down!
Oh, you're doing it on purpose!
You're a genius, Akira-sama!
Actually...
...this project is...
Peel.
P-Peel. Peel.
Don't touch me.
Peel. Peel. Peel.
Huh?
That's weird.
This project is...
Don't touch me.
This is...
Peel.
What's wrong with this thing?!
H-H-Hey, Seishi!
I got it, okay!
A-Akira-sama, calm down!
That's the name of your manager in real life!
This is my prop!
Could you have...
Of course not!
Okay!
Then we'll decide which figure to make based on your votes!
Have fun waiting for us to turn the character into a figure!
Everyone, please vote!
Okay.
That's all for today.
Look forward to next week's Lucky Channel!
Bye-bee!
A character from the actual show's obviously gonna win the poll.
What's with this?
Like I have a chance in hell.
No, you can't be sure yet.
I see.
They're finally going to make a figure of me.
What are you talking about?
This is...
That was great, Yuki-chan!
Thank you for listening.
I never expected this side of you.
Please...
It's embarrassing.
Hey, Yuki-chan.
Let's sing a song together.
Let's do that.
Sing! Sing!
A duet, huh?
Which song do you know?
Let's see...
Then I'll sing a song while we're waiting.
There's never gonna be a break, huh?!
You should also sing!
What is this?
Journey to the West.
Machaaki's Son Goku was great.
Huh?
Wasn't it Shingo-chan?
That was the third remake.
This one ran from 1978 to 1980.
The original series!
How old are you?!
This is a long intro.
This was when the actors delivered the main narration.
Like I would know!
Here it comes!
You're shouting again?!
Born from an egg on a mountain top.
It's in English. Forget that.
That's it after all this build-up?
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Miyuki.
When describing an enormously large object...
...it is described as being super-dreadnought.
The word dreadnought in this expression...
...was derived from a British ship commissioned in 1906...
...the HMS Dreadnought.
In other words...
...something super-dreadnought...
...would be larger than a dreadnought-class battleship.
Well, that was the original meaning...
...but now...
...it's being used in the former context.
Next time:
Just a Feeling.
「Just a Feeling」
Look forward to next time!
Since fall is for reading...
...I've been doing a lot of reading.
That's unusual.
Even though it's for an educational purpose...
...the expenses are piling up.
You don't have to buy them.
Couldn't you just go to a library or something?
They actually have some stuff you'd want.
Nah.
A library wouldn't have manga.
Reading, huh...
They mean books, you know...
Just
A
Feeling
Studying for Test
Can't concentrate...
Well, you have to take a break every now and then.
Like this.
I'll do a little gaming to relax.
It's Ms. Kuroi.
Hey!
Stop playing and get studying!
I'll be real pissed if your grades are bad.
Shit!
The authorities can even find me here!
Don't do this to me, Teacher!
This game suddenly isn't as fun with all these interruptions.
How did you study for tests when you were a student?
Played or slept when I couldn't concentrate.
Nothing special, really.
That's the same as me.
But as an authority figure, I have to be strict.
I get what she means...
...but it still feels unfair!
This time, I plan on setting goals and studying bit by bit.
Sis, teach me the stuff I don't get.
Then let's study together.
So in this case, x would equal...
What is it?
I just realized that my TV show's about to start.
In today's episode...
...a weekly magazine reporter...
...spreads word of the main character's pregnancy.
So you're going to watch TV?
It's okay, I'm taping it.
Um...
I get sleepy whenever there's a bunch of questions I don't get...
Which means you're always sleepy?
I probably shouldn't overexert myself right off the bat...
...so I'll call it a day.
Okay.
I see you're already losing your willpower.
I still can't concentrate!
Okay.
You want a trick for studying for a test?
I was wondering how you study.
Let's see...
If you concentrate too hard, you'll wear yourself out.
In my case, I just follow my usual habits.
So I'm pretty confident about today's test.
I feel so enlightened.
Aren't your usual habits a little risky?
You don't do anything.
But it's so cute...
And its claws are venomous.
My...
So it's actually quite frightening.
Yo.
Kagami.
How'd it go?
This one was pretty bad.
Though I maintained my standing.
So you also do bad sometimes.
Because Sis helped me out.
As a result, I did better than usual.
How about you?
Strangely enough, I did bad.
And I was so sure I'd do well.
Nothing strange about it at all.
It was inevitable.
But you know...
...I was feeling that birds of a feather flock together.
For example...
Kagami and Miyuki-san are both class representatives.
Kagami and I both like games.
Well, different genres though.
You play dating sims and RPGs.
And I play shooters.
I was thinking that Tsukasa and I were both stupid...
...but there was a significant gap this time.
Well, I'm not really concerned about doing bad.
Be a little concerned.
If you slack off because everybody else also did bad...
...you'll fall behind.
Actually...
I didn't make any bets with my dad...
...so I'm not really angry.
You're gonna grow up to be a bad person.
If you're gonna copy Miyuki...
...take notes regularly...
...instead of waiting till tests are coming up.
Miyuki-san is really methodical.
Textbook example of a type A person.
Many people have told me that...
...but I'm actually type O.
You're type O?
Never would have guessed.
However...
Blood Type Primer
According to this book...
...I possess many of the qualities...
...characteristic of type O people.
For example...
It's said that type O people tend to be...
...childish and innocent...
...which describes me perfectly.
Type O people tend to be pushy and possessive...
I guess there's another side to Miyuki-san.
You're probably type A.
But a lot of people mistake me for a type B.
Type A people are skilled in social functions and considerate.
They tend to seek peaceful human interaction?
Does this even match you?
I can be really sensitive to the situation.
Only when it's something you're interested in.
I'm gentle and attentive to other people.
When it involves homework.
What about you, Kagami?
Me?
I'm type B.
So you're laid-back, rude, erratic,
unconventional, naive, and insolent, huh?
What about it?
Then Tsukasa's type AB?
What's that supposed to mean?
Why?
Just a hunch.
If you go by personality...
...Tsukasa would be type A...
...and Kagami would be type B.
We're both type B.
We're twins, remember?
That's right.
I forgot.
And I'm not as laid-back as you are.
Speaking of horoscopes...
...I've also heard of ones for animals and sushi.
Sushi Horoscopes
What are your favorite things?
We'll use your answers to determine your personality.
Sushi?
Let's see...
Miyuki-san is...
So Miyuki would be salmon roe.
Still high-class, I see.
I love salmon roe!
And?
What about Tsukasa and me?
Cucumber roll.
A cucumber roll, huh?
Well, I guess it counts as sushi.
This is pretty accurate.
And what about you?
Me?
Sliced ginger?
It says sliced ginger!
Don't look down on ginger!
Well...
You can't have sushi without it...
...and the horoscope's description is positive.
That's true.
And cucumber rolls count as sushi, right?
Hello?
Konata?
About the blood type conversation today...
Just to make sure you know...
...fraternal twins can have different blood types...
...so your guess wasn't wrong.
Sounded like you got the wrong impression.
Thanks a lot.
You're an honest person.
I'm starting to see the type A in you.
Oh, yeah...
There was a psychic reading on TV.
With those things...
...they'll guess right with some
people and wrong with others...
...so they'd at least make one correct guess.
Kagami...
Don't be so pragmatic...
You'll never have fun in life.
Act more like your age.
Tsukasa.
You worked hard this time.
Kagami did worse than usual.
But she still got a higher score, huh...
Good work, girls.
How should I put it...
You did the best you could...
Ooh.
Tsukasa worked hard.
But Kagami still scored higher.
Hey, Matsuri.
Can't you be more considerate?
Good morning!
Oh, good morning.
I envy how the two of you are such fine young ladies.
Not at all.
You're too kind.
To get such wonderful grades at that Ryouou High...
I wish my children had a fraction of your ability.
It's like...
I'm being praised because I'm her sister...
Nah.
We aren't that impressive.
...so I can't really appreciate it.
Tests are over.
Why don't we go all-out and have some fun?
Sounds good.
How about watching a movie for once?
What's in theaters right now?
There's a great one right now.
What is it?
You could call it a splatter film...
...but it still has some
psycho-suspenseful, shocking horror elements.
Then let's do that!
How about we go home first and meet up later?
Let's do that! Let's do that!
This isn't fun...
I can't have fun like this!
Still got time. What should we do?
Konata sure is late.
Is she late again?
Maybe...
She couldn't have come before us, right?
Honestly...
The movie's about to start.
When did she...
I couldn't recognize you without that thing...
Anyway, we're short on time, so let's go.
Oh, yeah.
Pretend I'm your sister.
Why?
Well...
Then I can buy a child's ticket without looking weird.
Stupid kid.
She whines about her height all the time...
...but then she exploits it when she can!
That was terrifying, Take-rin!
You're so adorable.
I'm a little hungry now.
Me too.
And Tsukasa's probably hungry after screaming so much.
What should we have?
How about a cake buffet?
Sounds great!
The buffet...
A haven for satiating a woman's desires!
They've got so many cakes and drinks.
Sure do.
I wonder if we'll get through every one.
Piece of cake for Kagami.
This store has a time limit of one hour.
You can find beverages in the drink corner over there.
The cakes are located in the showcase over there.
Please help yourself.
Okay!
Bow.
And if you leave an excessive amount of leftovers...
...you'll have to pay an extra fee.
Please keep that in mind.
Then please enjoy yourselves.
What would be considered an excessive amount?
Some people take a bunch and don't finish.
Come on.
Let's go.
That's a lot...
Can you finish all that?
What about you?
This is normal for cake.
No sweat.
Time to eat!
Delicious!
And that one!
And this one!
I'm in pain now...
We should have slowed down after the first plate.
I've got heartburn.
Peek.
But we have to pay extra if we leave leftovers.
That's bad!
It hurts...
I-I can't do it...
We're almost out of time.
Oh, Kagami!
She's on her second wind!
It'd be a waste otherwise!
Impossible.
No! No!
If you drink too much water...
...you won't be able to eat any more!
Just stuff down what you can...
...and wash it down with water at the very end!
Don't sit there looking impressed
Get to eating!
I can't eat another bite...
You can handle pudding or Bavarian cream!
Here.
Can't you eat it?
I'm stuffed, too!
I'm out, man...
You can just pour the pudding down your throat!
Hurry it up!
This isn't fun...
I can't have fun like this!
C'mon! Get with it!
Tests are over...
...so I did some hardcore gaming...
...which is why I'm so sleepy...
If you studied that hard...
...your tests would have gone differently.
Recent dating sims have a bunch of save points...
...but I can never find a good place to stop.
I'm the type to do it all in one sitting.
I've been wondering...
A student shouldn't be able to buy those.
How do you buy them?
I get my dad to buy them for me.
No way!
This happens a lot...
But your family still continues to amaze me!
You actually go buy them, Pops?
Plus, as a daughter, you shouldn't even be asking!
So I'm really sleepy.
You probably don't play games, Miyuki-san.
I don't have a game console...
...but I have a computer, so I occasionally play some games.
What do you play?
Didn't expect this!
Games like Solitaire and Minesweeper.
It can get pretty intense.
They're games...
...but you've got it wrong, Miyuki-san.
But I know what you mean.
It's actually easy to get absorbed...
...in those kinds of simple games.
What kind of scores do you get, Yuki-chan?
Luck is a factor in Solitaire...
...but I often score over ten thousand.
As for Minesweeper, I completed expert in
under one hundred seconds the other day.
These kind of people really get into this kind of stuff...
There was a lot of sports stuff this year.
That one athlete got gold
in figure skating at the Winter Olympics.
And there was quite a fuss over high school baseball.
So many games were going into extra innings!
Yup, that Handkerchief Prince.
Speaking of baseball...
That one player went to America, right?
Is the Japan Series already over?
A long time ago.
No way!
Were there any bargain sales?
This year's Japan Series was between that team and that team...
...so there weren't any supermarket
or department store chains involved.
But they had a commemorative sale.
But it was probably just a sale on ham.
Did they do that...?
Anyway, I need to remember to do a check next year...
Knowing you...
...you're probably just gonna buy snacks.
I'm not.
I need stuff like salt, sugar, and soy sauce.
Those kinds of household staples.
Well...
Kagami wouldn't understand what I'm talking about, right?
So sorry!
So I suck at household chores!
Eyedrops?
Want me to help?
Thank you so much.
Okay.
Lie down.
Yes.
Okay...
Relax.
Y-Yes.
Then here I go.
Okay.
Relax your muscles.
Yes.
Um...
I'm sorry.
I'm not doing this on purpose...
Your face...
...scares me!
With mail-in prize contests...
...the problem is how it takes forever to receive the item.
That's why I came up with a way to
fully enjoy these sweepstakes, Kagamin.
What's that?
First, you enjoy the game like you're at a festival.
Then once the item arrives, you can be happy again,
since you've completely forgotten about it.
Two for the price of one.
The waiting's what I can't stand...
You're infinitely positive about the stuff you enjoy, huh?
Good lucky!
Yes!
I hope to have a cheerful Lucky Channel today!
We're already on our ninth episode today!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
And here's the person that the producer, Itou-san...
...is going to say "Hey, Shiraishi. Come here a sec." to...
Really?!
I'm Akira-sama's assistant...
100% charged with energy...
Minoru Shiraishi.
It's a pleasure.
Okay.
Today's the third character introduction.
Tsukasa Hiiragi's turn!
Prop time!
Roll...
Are you supposed to be a clumsy, slow turtle?
Tsu-
Thi-
I'm sorry.
This is finally getting exciting!
Yes!
Time to pull up our loincloths...
...and do our best!
Right, Akira-sama?
Loincloths?
I'm supposed to be an idol...
...so that stuff's kinda...
You handle it.
That's right...
Uh...
When you pull a loincloth up so tight that it gets pinched...
Hey.
I'd like to warn you out of concern.
C-Concern...?
Once an entertainer gets in the gutter...
...it's over.
So I'm an entertainer...
Also...
You've been using other people's material a lot lately...
...so watch yourself.
Yes!
Um...
What are we doing today?
Introducing Tsukasa Hiiragi-san.
That To Hea-
Mi-Mi-Miracle!
Kamigishi...
Minorun-run!
Right?
You can say that?
What do you think?
She reminds me of one of those old idol characters.
Uh, you think so?
Well, I guess you could say she gives off some idol vibes...
Don't make me laugh!
Tsukasa Hiiragi's an idol?
Where did that come from?
Y'know...
You're working with me here.
Learn what a true idol is about already.
Y-Yes, ma'am.
Tsukasa Hiiragi is merely a soothing character...
...with a loser's face.
A loser's face, huh...
Anyway...
...who gives a damn about Tsukasa?
Not even Pops ever hit me!
I'll teach you the basics of an idol right now.
First is the method for having pictures taken.
Now look here.
This will be a useful lesson for you.
So put some back into it.
Yes!
You know how people suddenly
take pictures when you're in the city?
Come on.
Press the shutter.
Fawn. Fawn. Fawn.
Looking like a loser...?
Yeah.
Like that.
Props are also important.
You should always carry them around.
How?
And you won't want to be caught off
guard when you're walking around...
...so always be attentive.
And...
...make sure you have sparkling white teeth.
Like a doll!
Intense.
And then...
...make sure your eyes are all wide like goggles...
...and only smile with these muscles.
Jeepers!
And you want a natural expression.
Like if someone suddenly turns a camera on you...
Akira's, like, whoa!
Like that.
Natural, you say...
Also, as a variation...
...if you're going with a guy into a ho—
Oh, no!
It's time to say goodbye!
So send us any questions
or comments about the show, please!
You can also send us messages
about the radio show on our home page!
Okay!
Then look forward to next week.
Bye-bii!
We had a photo shoot, right?
Yes, we did.
The one where I was in the cardigan.
How was it?
That was cute...
Shankya!
It was cute?
What's wrong?
Yeah, well...
Everyone said it looked cute.
Guess so.
Yep.
You were on a roll.
Sure was.
Looked fun.
The upturned eyes...
...with the uh...
...arms crossed below my face...
...was really fun!
Yes.
Are you hooked now?
Including the cross-dressing, yes.
I'm hooked.
Did you check the pictures?
No, I didn't.
The manager...
Yes.
...checked the pictures...
Yes.
...and said there were some questionable ones to be honest.
Well, I had a bunch of stiffy shots...
...so those are probably gone.
Sorry! Sorry!
Made a little mistake.
I'll actually sing the next one.
And she's already ordering another song.
Let me have the remote for once.
Okay.
Have you guys decided, Tsukasa?
It'll be a little longer.
I don't listen to music much, so I don't know many songs.
That's okay.
I'll sing in the meantime.
Hey.
Don't just sing anime songs.
This isn't an anime song.
I've heard this before.
What is this?
It's KyonKyon.
I used to sing this with my dad a lot.
So you've gone from anime songs to oldies.
That's an insult to KyonKyon!
We met amidst the wind.
Tsukasa.
Ever since the day we fell in love...
Why don't you just choose a simple song?
Like a children's song.
...this clueless heart of mine...
I'm looking through that section, too...
I'm sorry.
...has longed for you.
There's no rush.
We still have plenty of time.
Don't cry, tender heart.
As long as wishes come true...
I want to cross that river of tears...
...and forget it all.
You never notice...
...as I secretly yearn for you.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Konata.
In world 3-1 of Super (bleep) Brothers...
...there's a staircase near the end of the level...
...where you can jump on the falling turtle...
If you repeatedly hit the A button...
...to jump on the turtle...
...you can get infinite lives...
...which is great...
...but if you overdo it...
...and go over 129 lives...
...dying once leads to a game over.
I won't bother going, "So you can't have infinite lives!"
Maybe it's that.
A public service announcement from
the folks near Kamitobaguchi Station...
...that you're supposed to do things in moderation.
Next time:
「Aspiration」
Aspiration.
Look forward to next time!
They bought me another cell phone!
Don't put it in the wash this time.
I'll put it somewhere obvious.
Hey!
Give me a hand, Tsukasa.
Coming!
Aspiration
Ba.
L.
Sa.
Mi.
C.
Huh?
There it is.
Vinegar.
Too much!
I'll input it for you, so hand it over!
That's irritating!
I-It's okay.
Don't worry.
I can do it myself.
I'm here to play!
Cousin Yui.
Welcome!
Whatcha doing?
Playing a dating sim that just came out.
Then I'm gonna borrow some random manga.
'Kay.
This game is age restricted...
...but did she not notice...
...or is she letting it slide?
Which one is it, officer?
And so...
...we beef things up during Traffic Safety Awareness Week.
Like detailed checks...
...and explanations of traffic laws...
It's pretty rough.
And sometimes, they start yelling at you.
But when I look at how she usually acts...
Scary! Scary!
...she's not very convincing when talking about laws or safety!
I'm totally shocked!
I've heard that colds are lasting longer this year...
...so I need to get better quickly.
Based on my number...
...I'll probably be here a while.
I'll read while I wait.
Mr. Ando.
Mr. Shigeo Ando.
Ms. Takara.
Ms. Miyuki Takara.
Ms. Miyuki Takara.
Are you here?
Then the next person.
Ms. Mariko Nishiyama.
Huh?!
What?!
Did they call me?!
What time is it?!
I need to pay more attention to my surroundings.
We will soon arrive at the final stop, Kamata.
Where am I?!
So I taught Tsukasa how to text message the other day.
She still had no idea after all that messing around.
Yay!
Yay!
And she must have been really happy about it...
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
...since she's constantly texting me.
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
Must suck for the recipient.
Well, there's nothing to worry about.
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
Sender: Tsukasa
She's the type to start off excited...
...and eventually lose interest.
Some people are just childish like that.
She sent another one.
If she doesn't get bored, you'll be pretty swamped.
And does she even have that much to talk about?
We're practically together 24/7.
And she apparently learned how to use symbols.
Look.
How about we buy soy cream-man on the way home again today?
What's all the stuff at the end?
You can tell she's having fun...
I haven't even seen half of these before.
I guess she's finally gotten the hang of it.
Yeah. But I prefer the one with an afro
Yeah. But I prefer the one with an afro
Really? But they probably aren't
actually performing
Yeah, might be
I see
Heh
Hey.
I know how you feel...
...but could you stop spamming family members?
Do you have a minute?
What?
I'm not sure about how to use text messaging on a cell phone.
Hey, hey, hey!
It's really easy, Dad.
You're so hopeless.
I'll teach you.
So I guess some people get all
snobby after they've learned something.
Um...
That smell is beyond words.
Right?
It just stinks too much.
Seriously.
You've got a lot of stuff saved on here.
Hey!
Stop going through that!
You've got messages that shouldn't be seen?
Not really.
No reason.
It's a boy.
Definitely a boy.
It's not!
She's not picking up.
Guess I'll call her house.
Hello, Kagami?
Konata?
You should answer your cell.
Well...
It didn't ring so I didn't notice.
Honestly...
Doesn't that defeat the purpose?
And where is that thing anyway?
Your cell phone really serves no purpose, huh?
Anyway...
About next weekend...
Someone's talking to me.
Hold on.
Hey!
Hurry it up!
Wait a bit!
You've been on the phone too long!
Can't wait any longer!
Sorry. Sorry.
I got in trouble for being on the phone too long.
Sorry.
But I figured you guys would be relaxed about that stuff.
Sounds like it's pretty strict.
Nah...
We were in the middle of a fighting game.
Tell me that earlier!
In this place...
...my point cards shine with an invisible magic.
You end up making unplanned purchases, yeah?
You really wing everything.
Though I kinda understand.
She's here.
In this city, we have Ani**te and Ga**rs...
Two anime stores...
There exists a person who
buys the same thing from both stores...
Legendary Girl...
A!
Legendary Girl A shift!
Welcome!
The DVD for Haruhi Vol. 5's in stock!
Limited edition!
Regular edition!
All ready!
And we've got loads of related items!
That's right...
Just display every item we have in stock.
She'll buy whatever she can.
I wanted a limited Aquarian Age bookmark today.
Need to go to Gamers.
No good!
Then we'll do a sleepover this weekend and play all night.
We usually do stuff at our place...
...but can we go to your house?
I'd like to go over every now and then.
It's not that you can't...
...but my dad's usually home because of work.
Oh.
So that just increases the burden on me.
What burden?
I'm kinda looking forward to seeing what Konata's house is like.
Yo.
Welcome.
Sorry to impose.
Thanks for having us today.
Welcome.
I've heard a lot about you two.
You're shrine maidens who live at a temple, right?
What have you been telling him?!
So do you usually wear yellow hakamas?
And like, that's the first thing he has to say?
We're here.
This is Kona-chan's room!
Crazy as expected.
This is cute!
This door...
Probably hides a stash of stuff you don't want seen.
A door that must never be opened.
Nah.
I share most of that stuff with Dad...
...so he handles storage.
You share...
Oh, yeah.
Your dad's an author, right?
Then have you ever gotten hooked on a
light novel or dating sim your dad wrote?
Nah.
He doesn't write any of that stuff.
Really...
Didn't expect that...
But...
He likes that kind of stuff...
...so wouldn't he want to write them?
He's like a lurker...
According to him...
...he plays dating sims and life sims on his own time...
...so he doesn't feel the need to bring it to the workplace.
I've been at a loss for words for a while now.
Guess that's the Izumi family for you.
My dad was being all clingy the other day.
So I tried saying, "You're annoying, Dad!"
That's a little harsh, you know.
Then he's like...
Couldn't you at least say, "I hate you, Dad!" or something?
No.
That's not quite right either.
But your way of thinking wouldn't fulfill his expectations.
Yeah.
No idea what you're talking about.
Let's take a break.
This is it!
Even TV shows are starting to look like 2ch.
I guess.
Not that I would know.
Oh, yeah.
For someone hardcore, you don't use much of that lingo.
In normal situations.
In chatrooms, I'm like this.
Wow...
Is this even Japanese?
If you can read this, you've lost.
Is there anything I can help with?
Then serve the salad.
Let's eat!
It's great!
Sure is.
A job well done.
This is nothing for someone who does housework on a daily basis.
If you did more housework, you might get better.
Mind your own business.
Look, Konata.
It's perfect.
It's a scene out of my dreams!
A man eating a meal with three high school girls...
H-Heaven on earth...
Sakura...
...happens way more than it should in dating sims.
Tohsaka... Tohsaka's your sister!
Really now...
It gets chilly when it's late.
Should have put on a jacket.
A shooting star!
I couldn't make my wish three times.
It's pretty hard when they come out of nowhere.
But I'll pull it off one day and have my wish granted.
Tsukasa's a dreamer...
But it's impossible from a practical standpoint.
It's a superstition because you know it isn't going to work.
Why does this one have no dreams...?
Want a drink?
Thanks.
You switched hairstyles.
For fun.
While we were taking a bath.
Why do the same parts feel so different on different people?
A photo album.
Can I take a look?
Sure.
Kona-chan's so cute!
You haven't changed much.
And like...
...you sure are close with your dad.
That's my mom.
No way!
So young!
Don't I look like her?
She was legal, right?
I always wonder when I look at Dad.
What did Mom ever see in Dad?
Hey, now...
You look just like your mom, you know...
Then in that case...
What would be your type?
Mine?
When you put it that way, I don't really have one...
Really?
Spill it.
Which means Mom was okay with anyone.
And she said something about knowing Dad since they were little.
Well, that's a little...
Couldn't let Dad flounder around by himself.
You don't even hold back for your parents, huh?
But when I look at my mom...
In manga and games these days...
...a lot of middle schoolers look mature...
...and a lot of adults look really young.
What is this?
Do you want me to say something?
I wish Yuki-chan could have come.
Well, she's busy.
That's it!
I'll text her so she isn't lonely.
Miyuki's really considerate, so stop that.
I got a reply.
I'm glad you're having fun.
I'm working hard to finish my homework right now.
Please invite me again next time.
I forgot we had homework!
Do something, Kagami!
Our class didn't have any.
Can I go to sleep?
Wait!
That shooting star.
It might work if I use short wishes.
Uh, you think?
What are you doing?
Studying how to say wishes faster.
Stop escaping reality and get your homework done.
Hey, Yuki-chan.
I didn't get this part in class earlier.
That part?
Konata leads to Kona-chan.
Miyuki leads to Yuki-chan.
Then what nickname would you use for Kagami?
Kaga-chan?
Gami-chan?
Kagami means mirror.
Kyo also means mirror.
[
]
Maybe Kyo-chan.
Pronounce Kagami a different way.
Kyo.
Good naming sense.
Kyo also means strong.
It feels strong like her, too.
Kyo also means evil.
And you could use this Kyo-chan, too
Th-That wasn't my intention...
We probably shouldn't tell Sis.
Then what nickname would you give yourself?
Tsuka-chan?
Kasa-chan?
Hi-chan, I guess.
It's harder with my first name.
I see.
You do give off a "hi-hi" image all the time.
That wasn't my intention...
Okay.
Then I'll start calling you Hi-chan.
What?
Huh? Huh?
But it feels kind of weird...
...if I chose it myself...
And what about that?
That?
Doesn't matter.
Want revenge, Sebastian?
Name's Shiraishi.
Hey!
Kyo-chan!
Kyo-chan!
Is she calling me?
It's too hard to understand, so stop that.
Then how do you want me to call you?
Doesn't Kagami work?
A nickname would be better.
Like Kona-chan or Yuki-chan...
Then call me Kagami the Great.
Hey!
Kagami the Great!
She really did it!
What is it?
Just trying it out.
Sorry for the wait, Kagami the Great.
What's wrong, Kagami the Great?
Whoa...
My bad...
Please...
Just call me normally.
Good lucky!
Okay!
We're already on the booming tenth episode of Lucky Channel!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami.
Hello!
I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi!
And right off the bat...
...we have our fourth character introduction...
Kagami Hiiragi!
She serves as a punch line character in the show.
But isn't she just a tsundere?
What an obvious setup.
I beg to differ.
The classification of Kagami Hiiragi as a tsundere is a bit hasty.
Then what?
First, do we comprehend the true
meaning of the qualities of a tsundere?
No, unfortunately...
...the word tsundere has suffered misuse and decay...
...and one could say that the definition has evolved.
To begin with, the word tsundere was born in the year 2002...
...an Internet term...
...but the original definition was...
...a character who starts off hostile...
...and eventually becomes affectionate.
Yes!
In other words...
...it was supposed to describe a change over time!
Do you really understand?
And now...
...it is used to describe the multiple faces of a character.
In other words...
...hostile on the outside...
...and affectionate on the inside...
...would be how the word is currently understood.
I declare here!
This is plainly a mistake!
We must bring back the true meaning of tsundere...
...and restore this depraved nation!
Rise up, citizens!
Not bad, Sebastian.
Who's that?
So if Kagami's not a tsundere, what is she?
You meant me?
I don't really get this complicated stuff...
...but if you insist...
...do you have a replacement for
what's currently known as tsundere?
Uh...
It's not that I don't...
Maybe cool-dere...
No, that's wrong.
Deretsun?
You got no sense at all.
Tsundere's fine.
No, that's...
That's wrong!
That's it!
Let's ask the viewers to come up with a new expression!
Good idea!
Delegating, huh?
So, everyone in front of the TV!
Yes, you!
Try to come up with a new word
to describe characters like Kagami!
And rewrite the modern lexicon!
Dubbed the Complete Tsundere Debate!
You can find more details on the radio show and home page!
We're waiting for your passionate ideas!
This is the end.
Oh, well.
Lots and lots...
Lots and lots...
Bye-bee.
Bye-bee!
Fast forward!
Whoa, I talked a lot today.
The most ever, yeah?
Huh?
Akira-sama?
Wh-What's wrong?
Satisfied?
Yes! Uh...
This is the most I've ever spoken.
I think I did a fair job.
I'm going to dinner with the
executive and producer from your studio.
Uh...
We're gonna discuss your future.
Uh, h-hold on a sec.
What do you mean?
No point in telling you about how your future's looking.
No, no, no, no, no!
And aren't you still working at CoCo*chi?
That's only during the day.
And it doesn't pay much.
And the grill place?
I'm still doing that.
Or that doesn't even matter!
That's intruding into my privacy, so stop!
I'm next.
Tsukasa.
How about this one?
This works!
Right, Yuki-chan?
I know this.
Then sing it.
Thanks, Kona-chan.
Thank you very much.
No problem.
They chose a song?
Lonely.
Your battered figure is reflected in the window.
This song was popular when we were in preschool, right?
Don't really know.
I walked aimlessly...
I'm sorry.
Neither do I.
I remember.
Sighed inwardly...
Our older sisters sang it a lot.
Songs sung by parents and older siblings...
I'm proud.
...while from an earlier generation...
I've always been searching for something...
...tend to be memorable.
...to bind this fragile, ephemeral passion.
Why can I no longer dream innocently as I once did?
There is no place for me in this city.
Love spills from my body.
Caved, huh?
Can't be helped.
It's really high.
The crowd—
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Kagami.
When you go out to eat...
...and order something with liquids...
...and a few drops splatter onto your clothes...
...it's pretty depressing.
And it really sucks if it's curry sauce.
And you happen to be wearing your favorite clothes.
Leaves you down the whole day!
And when you buy a box lunch
with sauce from a convenience store...
...and you carry it level so the contents don't spill...
...but once you open the bag...
...you discover that it spilled inside and everything's a mess.
Makes you lose your appetite.
And when you ask them to bag
hot and cold items separately...
...and they bag the cold drinks with your magazines...
...and the paper sucks up the condensation...
...and the magazine's all soggy...
...and you're like what was the
point in bagging them separately then?!
Next time:
「The Many Ways to
Spend Christmas Eve」
The Many Ways to Spend Christmas Eve.
Look forward to next time!
We saw a shooting star the other day...
...but Kagami said something about the
wishing three times thing being unrealistic.
Shooting stars are so wonderful.
I haven't seen many of them.
It's difficult to see the stars from our house.
Right...
Since your house is in the city, right?
I would probably be too amazed...
...to have time to make a wish.
The sight of a dazzling, shining star...
...would fill you with feelings of joy.
That could explain the myth that shooting stars grant wishes.
Your honesty is what dazzles me.
The Many
Ways
to Spend
Christmas
Eve
It's almost winter break.
But we have finals first.
Do you have any plans for winter break?
Nothing.
Reminds me...
We haven't taken a vacation in a while.
I went to Asakusa the other day.
When was that?
You know how you get sleepy on the train during winter?
She missed her stop?!
Huh?
But isn't that the opposite direction?
The train reached the end of the line and turned around...
...and then I missed my stop again...
By the time I came to, we were in Asakusa.
Hey now.
You can only miss your stop so many times.
But it wasn't entirely a bad thing.
Since I hadn't visited Asakusa in a while.
Shouldn't be doing that right before finals.
And I had a feeling I saw a girl in a
sailor uniform with a machine gun walk by...
What was that about?
Don't tell me someone was making a hit.
And you know...
Sleeping more helps you grow more!
You're growing?
I got an even better one.
My dad pulled an all-nighter and then went to turn in a manuscript.
He got on an early-morning train but missed his stop...
...then it reached the end and made a U-turn...
...and when he woke up, he'd already missed his stop...
...and this happened a few more times.
He started to wake up when he got close to his station...
Patrasche...
...but he still ended up missing it.
I'm so tired...
He was tired and wanted to get
home and sleep, but he couldn't get home.
In the end, he no longer knew...
...which direction he was going whenever he woke up.
Unbelievable...
I still wake up before my stop when I fall asleep.
That's amazing!
How do you know?
Maybe she has an internal alarm clock.
Though it doesn't work all the time.
What was that?
Since she's always snacking away.
Shut up!
But train seats are really warm...
...so you get really sleepy.
That's true.
It's all warm and fuzzy...
...like you're sitting next to the window in the classroom...
...on a sunny winter afternoon.
What's this?
Covering for each other?
I-It's not like that!
The other day...
When I tried to wake you up on the ride home...
Hey, wake up!
We're there.
Just five more minutes...
I mean it...
She yelled out half-asleep.
Everyone around us was laughing.
One of my friends did that in class once.
Sheesh.
You two are so similar.
You're grouping us together?!
But why five minutes?
Well, if you went to wake someone up
and they were like, give me another hour...
...wouldn't you be pissed?
Well, that's true...
...but five minutes comes up in a lot of other situations.
Like, just wait five minutes!
You have a point.
Maybe 'cause it isn't too long or too short?
Though the five-minute wait for a train feels really long.
Sure does!
Guess so.
But then again...
People who say to wait five minutes...
...tend to make you wait a lot longer.
You know how people say to not use
your cell or put on makeup on the train?
But it's a lot worse when the person next to you leans on you.
They're so heavy.
And you end up wanting to stand after managing to get a seat.
And when you're stuck with the sticky head of an old person...
Sometimes, I try to shove them off...
...but they somehow manage to
keep returning to the same position.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a mystery.
When I fall asleep...
...and there's a man on one side and an empty seat on the other...
...I try to lean myself towards the empty seat...
...but for some reason, I always end up leaning the other way.
Guess your body feels more comfortable leaning a certain way.
When I see someone leaning over...
...I shrink up like this...
...then their elbow hits my side.
Doesn't that mean they're actually awake?
Really?
Well...
Bye-bee!
Goodbye.
You know how...
...some people at our school take the inbound train home...
...and some people take the outbound train home?
Don't the ones who take the
inbound train look more refined somehow?
Since Yuki-chan's an inbounder.
That's not...
Yeah, yeah.
Back to the farm, fellas.
Oh.
This is the stop before.
Yo!
I didn't get any studying done yesterday.
I actually put in a lot of effort this time.
If I do say so myself.
How much studying did you do?
Only four hours.
A whole four hours!
Huh?
You're good at everything, Kagami.
Well, I do a lot of studying.
Just between you and me.
You're definitely really competitive.
Well...
Maybe it's my pride as the older sister...
I feel like I have to be ahead of Tsukasa.
Though I usually say neither of us is really older or younger.
I used to be pretty worried about that stuff.
But Tsukasa probably wasn't much competition.
Well, that's true...
She's just like Kona-chan!
It's almost Christmas!
I wonder what my present will be this year.
You still get presents...
How long did you believe in Santa Claus?
Santa Claus isn't real?
What...?
Santa never came to Konata's house...
...so her dad gave her presents in his stead.
That's why she thought he might be out there.
That old man...
He really wants to look good in front of his daughter, huh?
Hey, Hiiragi!
Hiiragi-san.
Here's the handout from before.
Gotcha.
And then, Hiiragi-chan...
Hiiragi!
You dropped your pencil.
Thanks.
Hey, Kagami!
Kagami-san.
Here's the handout from earlier.
Got it.
Sebastian, like, stinks.
Kagami.
You dropped your handkerchief.
Oh my.
Maybe I go to Tsukasa's class a little too much.
My cavity started hurting recently.
My, how dreadful.
I really can't stand dentists.
You went to see the dentist for your cavity the other day.
Is it better now?
Dentists take a long time on each tooth...
...and they have to repeat the procedure for every tooth...
...so it takes a long time, right?
So I ended up escaping...
...after making a number of excuses.
What to do?
Even though she sounded all cute...
...that's actually pretty crazy!
Konata!
Wanna go wild with everyone on Christmas?
Sorry.
I already have plans for Christmas.
Oh.
Is it a man?
Something like that.
Are you going somewhere with your dad?
Nope.
I told Dad that I'd be home late.
Don't tell me...
You're really going on a date with your boyfriend?
When did you...
Sorry to disappoint you...
...but I'm just working.
Oh...
Almost all the customers are male, so I wasn't lying.
Thought you'd managed to get ahead of us.
You got me.
There's a special event on Christmas.
We dress like Santa CIaus for that.
You really love that kind of stuff, huh?
But you know...
You guys also cosplay as shrine maidens for New Year's.
At your temple.
Don't call it cosplay.
Anyway...
It's good that Santa Claus gives everyone presents...
...but ever since I was little, I was like, he's totally trespassing.
You shouldn't look down on something based on a holy man.
Spiteful brat.
Still...
Santa is supposed to give children dreams...
...so what's with the men who turn
to this little kid with their dreams?
What's this?
You just casually insulted a lot of people...
And is it okay for you guys to celebrate Christmas?
Oh, yeah.
We usually got Christmas presents, right?
We worship every god there is.
We regularly visit temples.
And we sang in a church choir once.
Sounds peaceful.
But...
Yes?
A shrine maiden said she wanted
to get married in a wedding dress...
Is that okay?
Wouldn't that be a little complicated?
Yo!
Getting chilly these days.
Cousin Yui, welcome!
Whatcha watching?
A detective show.
Any good?
Not really.
Nothing else to do.
Okay, I got it.
That man's the killer.
Please wait, Officer.
There's something odd about this case.
Nothing odd at all.
Case closed!
What's with you?
This has nothing to do with you.
This is why cops are useless.
Aren't you a cop yourself...?
Why'd someone have to call now?
They're about to reveal the killer.
How can you tell?
Look.
I see.
You're the killer, huh?
No use in hiding it now.
I wonder why these two-hour
shows always end on the edge of a cliff.
Maybe cause people aren't willing to
act until their back's against the wall?
Yahoo!
How ya doing?
Cousin Yui, evenin'.
Whatcha watchin'?
A movie for a popular detective show.
Dad rented it.
Crimes don't happen in conference rooms!
They happen at the scene!
No, no, that's wrong.
Nobody ever gets that passionate.
You're going to deny this too?
Pretty sure that...
...the receipts were stolen at the behest of the chief.
This is why he fails.
You know what's going on?
That's right...
They eat pork bowls a lot in police shows...
...but apparently, that isn't actually allowed.
Well, it's fiction...
...so a lot of it's probably made-up.
So police commissioners' granddaughters aren't really like that?!
Police commissioners' granddaughters?
Well, I've never met one.
I'd at least want Mai-chan to exist...
To give me hope...
Empty dream.
There sure are a lot of cases with adults going after children.
Indeed...
I've been thinking...
If you taught kids martial arts...
...wouldn't there be a decrease in that stuff?
After intensive training...
...Master Oyama was able to beat a
cow with his bare hands, with one blow.
And bears toppled like trees after a couple of hits!
I see.
But won't that come back to haunt you?
When those kids grow up...
...the adults will be strong, too.
U-Um...
You know...
People say training in the martial arts...
...helps you mature as a person.
I see.
But...
There's someone who does martial
arts and hasn't matured right here.
How rude!
Oh.
I have this cousin, Cousin Yui's little
sister, who's entering high school next year.
She's physically weak...
Cousin Konata!
...but she's sweet and pure and really adorable.
But when I start thinking about how a
healthy spirit leads to a healthy body...
....I start feeling like something dark
is lurking behind those shining eyes.
I doubt aphorisms are universal.
Look at you.
The year's almost over.
Once it's December, you always feel like the year flew by so fast.
Are you going to help out at your
temple as shrine maidens again this year?
Probably.
Come draw your fortune again.
With fortunes...
If you get really bad luck, it's an unpleasant feeling.
But if you get really good luck...
...it feels like you already wasted
your luck for the year, doesn't it?
Well, that's why people say average luck is best.
Okay!
Then here's an early present from your teacher!
Here are your report cards!
How did you do, Kona-chan?
Here! Good work!
Teacher!
I don't want this present!
We give presents based on effort in my school of Santa.
Think on it.
Like a bonus to your winter homework.
I wonder what kind of Christmas cakes will be good this year!
When you go to a bakery...
...there are so many cute cakes...
...that you can have fun just looking.
What happens to the cakes that aren't sold before Christmas?
Perhaps the employees take them home.
But if nobody takes them, they might throw them away.
They often compare marriage to Christmas.
Like how twenty-five is the end of the line.
Once you're past twenty-five,
a Christmas cake is just another cake.
After one night, it's just another decorated cake...
...that suddenly looks stale...
...so you lose your appetite.
I was talking about Santa Claus with Kona-chan the other day.
How long did you believe in Santa, Yuki-chan?
It feels like you would have been a true believer like me.
I also believed in Santa Claus.
When I was little, I tried to send a
letter of gratitude to Santa Claus...
...and did some research.
But I didn't learn much after asking my parents...
...so I did some thorough investigating...
...and learned of the people Santa Claus was based on...
...and once I saw the phrase "origin of Santa Claus" pop up...
...my dreams were quickly shattered.
How'd you do, Miyuki-san?
Lemme see!
Just what you would expect from Yuki-chan.
I could never do so well.
I feel a little pissed about losing...
Yuki-chan's at the top of our class, so it's hopeless...
We could never beat her.
No.
I don't care about grades...
...but stuff like bust size...
Look! Whoa!
I'm hungry.
I'll have a cup of ramen.
Not done yet?
These three minutes of waiting feel really long.
I'll use this to kill time today.
And then your noodles end up soggy, right?
Me too!
The extra broth for my cup fried soba dried up!
You people...
She told me she would be late...
But this is too late!
I can't let her make a habit of this.
Need to give her a stern dressing down every now and then.
As the man of the house.
I'm home!
Konata!
Come here for a minute!
What time do you think it i—
Merry Christmas!
This is my Christmas present for you.
It must have been cold outside!
Want some hot tea?
Yay!
I do! I do!
I'm so happy I could die.
Yo!
G'day!
Cousin Yui's here to save the day!
You stink of alcohol!
It's dangerous to DUI!
I parked the car somewhere and had a drink nearby.
Listen to me!
It's Christmas Eve yet my husband's not here!
Our plans tonight are...
Cousin Yui...
Shouldn't you go to your parents'
place instead every once in a while?
Hello?
Yui?
It's me.
I was going to sneak in and surprise you...
...but it was locked.
Are you at your parents' place?
I'm coming home!
Right away at full speed!
Running every light on the way!
Seriously, you shouldn't be breaking the law.
I'll drive you.
I've got a little time.
I'll log in for a sec.
Huh?
Teacher's on.
Teacher.
Let's go crazy.
Until morning.
Please wait one moment.
It's not a leftover.
Doesn't count as a leftover.
Nanako Kuroi
'Cause I bought one.
27 years old
Single
I was here last Sunday to buy manga.
Don't get why you pay the fare to come here so much.
Even if it's for the points...
...this is pretty excessive.
You really love this stuff.
Besides, do you even use the prizes they give?
I don't.
Thought so.
That kind of stuff is hard to use.
Yep. Yep.
lt'd be a waste to use.
Their value would go down.
Oh, so that's how it is...
Whatever.
No!
Yes.
Didn't you get shocked by static electricity?
Nope.
Why's that?
Konata's always sitting in front of the computer...
...so her body's already full of weird waves?
Still, I really can't stand winter for that reason.
And I heard you can get shocked just by touching someone's hand.
Ow!
Maybe this means you two don't really get along with each other.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Oh my.
Ow!
Whatcha doing?
Oh, I wanted to try it again!
Stronger!
Good lucky!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
We're already on the eleventh episode of Lucky Channel!
And on this eleventh episode...
...I have some wonderful news you've all been waiting for!
U-Uh...
Everybody's sent in...
She's really in it today.
...lots of passionate letters...
...asking for Akira to show up in the actual show!
H-Hello.
On the next episode, I, Akira Kogami...
I'm the assistant Minoru Shiraishi.
Zip it!
...will be showing up in the actual show!
But I need to introduce myself!
Thank you to Konata Izumi from
Saitama along with everyone else...
...who sent postcards to Newtype!
So Akira-sama's also making an appearance?
What's with the...
"Like, you're finally showing up in the twelfth episode?
I've been in it for, like, forever!
Ho. Ho. Ho."
...attitude you've got?
A-Absolutely not!
It's an honor to appear with Akira-sama in the actual show as well!
Appear?
All you did this week was pick up a handkerchief, yeah?
You shouldn't be thinking you've got
what it takes to make it in this business!
Don't forget that you can just disappear like that!
I-I'll keep that in mind.
After that announcement...
...you can't wait for the next episode!
You want it now?
Everyone is probably trembling...
Er, shaking naked in their boots in anticipation!
Hey.
We should treat our fans with care...
...and air it right now!
We can grab a thirty minute slot, right?
Uh...
That'd be pushing it...
Pretty please?
Or forget it.
So send any messages you have to the radio show or the home page!
Bye-bee!
Bye-bee!
What to do?
It'd be bad if I overshadowed the main characters, right?
It would indeed.
But there's a tendency for the
main character's friends and rivals...
...to end up more popular than the actual main characters!
What?
A-Akira-sama?
What's wrong?
Aren't you...
Yes?
...talking about yourself?
Don't get so full of yourself 'cause you're popular lately!
No, absolutely not!
Don't expect this to last!
No, never!
You won't be placing first in the poll!
What are you talking about?!
Don't mess with me!
That's impossible.
Listen to m—
Next, we have a duet from Tsukasa and Miyuki-san.
Yuki-chan.
Let's go up front to sing.
You chose a song for them to sing...
How bizarre.
I know all kinds of songs.
But it's still an anime song, huh?
Anime songs actually come in handy in these situations.
That would be so wonderful!
Really would be so wonderful!
This dream! That dream!
I have so many dreams!
Every single one of them...
...will come true!
The magical pocket makes them come true!
I want to fly freely through the sky!
Here!
Bamboo-copter!
Not even close!
An! An! An!
I love you so much!
Doraemon!
Homework, clean—
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Tsukasa.
Um...
I was really hungry one night...
...but it was really late...
...so I was wondering if I should eat something...
I finally decided a little bite would be okay.
And then I went to the kitchen...
...and I remembered I had some snacks left over...
...so I opened up the freezer...
I'm already out of time?!
Next time:
「Let's Go to the Festival」
Let's Go to the Festival.
Look forward to next time!
[15th Concert - Symphony No. 9, Opus 125]
[15th Concert - Symphony No. 9, Opus 125]

[15th Concert - Symphony No. 9, Opus 125]
Miyuki-san!
Got any plans for the end of the year?
Izumi-san.
There's this festival, and I was wondering if you'd like to go...
A festival for the end of the year?
Sounds like fun.
It'll be lots of fun!
Is it something like a snow festival?
But I'm going to visit relatives...
Pretty sure that...
...I received a similar invitation back during summer.
Kagami-san.
I'll translate what Konata said.
She wants buddies to buy stuff for her at Comiket.
I was totally freaked out by the site when I went.
I'm not lying.
A festival's a festival.
It's all work and no fun by yourself.
Let's Go
to the
Festival
Dec
Heisei 18
Hello?
This is the Izumi residence.
Konata?
I'm writing New Year's cards right now.
Are you guys in mourning and refusing cards?
Didn't get a letter about it...
No.
Where did that come from?
Well, you know...
Weren't you absent one day this
year because of a death in the family?
Um...
But don't worry about that.
Don't tell me you used another trick out of manga?!
Shiny shine!
I'm in the middle of cleaning right now.
I see.
Then I won't keep you too long. I'll hang up now.
Bye!
I wonder why...
When there's something you don't
want to do, you suddenly want to clean...
...but once you start cleaning, it suddenly feels like a pain?
Konata.
Less resting, okay?
It's called Comiket?
FIRST-TIMER
I heard it was a big festival...
FIRST-TIMER
FIRST-TIMER
...but it sure starts early.
I'm so excited!
SECOND-TIMER
Looks like you haven't heard anything.
SECOND-TIMER
SECOND-TIMER
Poor thing.
REGULAR-VISITOR
Nah.
REGULAR-VISITOR
She'll get used to it soon enough.
REGULAR-VISITOR
Tsukasa...
Just so you know...
...this event is gonna exhaust you...
...in more than one way...
Will you be okay?
Then I'll do my best!
Do you really understand?
We're picking up more and more of her people...
Okay!
You'll soon be allowed to enter!
Sis...
This place is kinda scary...
Told you...
Regular Participants
Circle Members
Industry Members
That's right.
I should explain your assignments now.
Assignments?
Here you go.
These are your shopping lists.
Once we get inside, we'll split up and go
around the circles according to this map.
You two handle sections 1-3 in the east building.
I'll take 4-6.
But be careful.
If you don't follow the path marked in red...
...you might get stuck between rows of displays...
...and end up trapped.
And here and here...
If you're swept into the crowd there...
...you'll be stuck for over half an hour.
Why do we have to work so hard?
Just do it.
The ones marked with green can wait until afternoon.
They're stocked up...
...so there's almost no danger of them running out.
Just focus on the ones marked in red before noon.
S stands for something newly published.
K stands for something already in print.
If you don't know what's what, just buy everything.
Here's your ammo.
You're going to have to pay in cash.
The coffee will be your only refreshment for a while.
Take a drink every thirty minutes.
This will be our final rendezvous point.
1 PM on the dot.
I'll wait fifteen minutes...
...but if you don't show up...
...I'll go look for you in the medical office, so watch the clock.
That is all.
Any questions?
You only ever sound...
...intelligent and passionate when this kind of stuff is involved.
Please don't run!
Climax from the beginning!
The limit for new works is four copies per person.
Please cooperate.
Um...
Excuse me.
This is A-92, right?
Yes.
One of each new book?
That will be 1,000 yen.
Yes, what did you need?
Um...
Which of these are new...
Yes.
The new ones would be this and this.
Each one is 500 yen.
Good work!
Did you enjoy the snacks?
That's wonderful!
U-Um...
Three of each please.
Thank you for your business!
Dripping Brigade Chief...
...and Naughty Captain, correct?
Your total comes to 3,000 yen!
I'd like these.
Okay.
Your total is 4,500 yen.
Here.
Thank you very much!
Locked and loaded...
Onto the next point.
Um...
Is this the east building?
Then north should be this way...
Um...
Wa—
Excuse me!
I'm going that way!
I've pretty much covered all the big places.
Let's see...
The next place is...
Just a peek...
Gauron and Sousuke are...
This is...
Would you like that?
It'll be 500 yen.
Um...
Too intense for me!
She's here.
It's her.
Legendary Girl A!
Calm down.
She'll think we're weird if we panic.
But there's a weird jinx...
...where every circle suddenly becomes big after she buys a book!
It's impossible to stay calm!
I know!
That's why we put so much effort into this book!
So she would buy it!
You're right...
Even though it was the end of the year...
...we skipped work to do this!
This year will be our year!
Can I take a look?
Yes! Go ahead!
Uh...
What do you think?
We put a lot of work into the concert scene.
It's okay.
Thankssomuch.
Don't cry!
Next summer for sure!
Um...
Excuse me.
Yes?
What's the matter?
Where is Pu-61 located?
Pu?
Wasn't Pu in the east building?
Where is the east building?
This is the west building.
If you want to go to the east building...
...get in that line there...
...and go up one floor.
How long will it take?
Let's see...
At this time, probably an hour.
Please wait one moment
Okay, I'm done.
Sorry, Kona-chan.
I just now got back from the west building.
You get completely lost after getting caught up in the crowd...
...in this event...
I had to wait in line for an hour to use the restroom.
Well...
I figured it would be a rough schedule for a first-timer...
...so let's just stroll around for the afternoon.
You're not done yet?
But you know...
...it's gotten a lot better since they moved this to Ariake.
They only had two convenience stores near the site at Harumi.
Site at Harumi?
The last one at Harumi was twelve years ago, huh?
Wait.
How old were you?
Around five?
My dad took me.
We always stayed at this place called Hotel Urashima.
My first time was at the summer festival.
That was one crazy second floor.
The sweat from all the participants evaporated...
...and turned into these fluffy steam clouds.
Enough already.
Don't want to hear it.
Everything's gotten a lot easier after they moved this to Ariake...
...but maybe it's 'cause of the people mainly here for events...
...many of the younger participants think
of themselves as customers, sadly enough.
This was supposed to be an event put on by all of us.
Sorry to interrupt you while you're on a roll...
...but you've totally lost me.
I didn't come here during summer...
...but they also have places like these, huh?
There.
The main stuff is probably all sold out, though.
It's Nagato! Nagato!
The person behind Nagamon is here as a salesgirl!
Here.
Thank you very much.
What are you talking about?
How can you be out of Haruhi goods?!
Why did I bother coming here if the
Nagato phone cards are sold out?!
Please calm down!
He's horrible.
I can't do anything about it!
Like I just said.
Like I care!
There's been a spike in people like him.
I'm never coming back to this dump!
I'm terribly sorry, sir!
Unfortunately, our limited goods...
...have already sold out!
Really?!
Really.
Well, if you're gonna show up this late.
Figured as much.
I feel for you...
...but you gotta line up early...
Fool!
Asia...
Wh-What?!
Even customers who show up late...
...must be completely satisfied!
Have you lost the true spirit?
B-But...
All we have is leftover stuff now!
Leftover, you say?
Leftover items still have value!
A value that can't be found...
...in popular and typical moe items!
This Comiket exists to reveal their true value!
Now that all limited goods have been eliminated...
...the true battle has begun for industry booths!
B-By George...
Now!
Make a recommendation to the customer!
Dig up your true item!
Anything I can use as a weapon?
Ho—
How about this?!
No!
Gotta be this!
No, you see.
Nagato and everybody else are selling like hotcakes...
...yet look at this.
Even Koizumi's sells well.
Quiet!
This one's gone unsold for three years!
And the Captain's sold out instantly!
So please purchase this Kyon!
No, I recommend Sousuke!
No, I wanted CoCo Saikoubi-chan!
You...
...fools!
Y-You're...
President Takahashi!
Yes.
I am...
...Takahashi the President!
I overheard your conversation!
Your desire to promote a new perspecive of value is commendable!
That place is always pumped up.
R-Really?
However...
R-Really...
I cannot forgive your selfish desire to promote unpopular characters!
Well...
They're both main characters...
Sis, I'm sleepy.
I'm sleepy, too.
We had to help out at home as soon as we got back from Ariake...
Why do they have that event on New Year's Eve?
Kagami.
Tsukasa.
Happy New Year!
Kona-chan.
Happy New Year!
You have an awful lot of energy for
someone who was at that event since morning.
Plus, it's cold, so I figured you wouldn't bother.
Well, that's true...
...but January 1st is a new beginning...
...so I have to come charge up for the coming year.
That's admirable.
No, that's what Dad said.
Hello!
Suddenly, I'm disturbed.
Shrine maiden outfits are so invigorating!
This and that...
We're done praying.
Okay.
Good job.
Did you guys do any praying?
Oh, yeah...
You were doing some intense praying, Sis.
There you go blabbing again!
It wasn't that intense.
I-I was just hoping I could be in the
same class as you and Miyuki this year.
Sis...
What about Kona-chan?
You know...
Kagami's actually pretty cute.
Be quiet!
You making fun of everything is why I never want to tell you!
And then there's the way you resist...
Something wrong with that?!
Sis has always been the only one in a different class.
Maybe Ms. Kuroi hates me.
I'll also pray...
...to be in the same class...
...as Sis!
Tsukasa...
No way.
Kagami needs to be in a different class.
Wh-Why?
'Cause you know...
That way I can borrow stuff from you when I forget mine.
And I won't get caught if I copy your homework.
And if you're in our class, my rank will go down.
Then you go be in a different class by yourself.
The other...
The other day...
Sebastian was...
Female students are so wonderful...
Are you going to draw your fortune this year?
Might as well.
Since I'm here.
Bad
Very Good
Bad
Very Good
Bad
Bad
Bad
Bad
It's good to get an early start on the year.
Indeed.
And I got to see something nice.
This will be a good year.
Don't worry.
If you've already hit rock bottom...
...things can only get better.
Something good will happen.
What can I say...
It all depends on how you word it.
Thanks...
Want to tie a bad luck ward on the tree?
I'll do that.
So many!
Here, too!
Here's a spot!
So this is the power of bad luck...
Looks like it.
Whether or not something good will happen...
...depends on the amount of effort you spend.
Drawing your fortune is just a game of luck.
That's true...
Although a staff member shouldn't be saying that...
Maybe I should go for a whole set from very good to very bad.
Are they supposed to be trading cards?
Maybe you can draw a secret fortune.
What would a secret fortune be like?
Like ultra bad luck.
Why'd you go with something bad?
Nobody would want that.
You know...
Whoever collects all of them gets a special item!
No, there's no such thing.
Oh, yeah...
[kagami mochi: two stacked rice cakes; traditional New Year's decoration]
I just saw a huge kagami mochi...
This big!
Is that where your name came from?
Well, you're not totally wrong...
The round shape of a kagami mochi...
...is modeled after a mirror...
...but it's long been said that gods rest within mirrors...
...so the name is supposed to invoke the blessings of the gods.
And the round shape also signifies family happiness.
Her name has such a fantastic origin...
...yet she grew up to be an awfully pragmatic person!
Would you like one?
Okay.
There sure are a lot of worshippers.
Since it's New Year's.
Though we aren't that well-known.
I wonder how many of them are
here for the shrine maidens like Dad.
Here we go again!
There aren't that many!
Maybe...
Then once again...
Happy New Year!
Let's have another wonderful year.
Yeah.
Let's.
Hi!
Happy New Year!
How about it?
Look at this beautiful sight!
Isn't it great?
Isn't it fantastic?
Look at all the pretty flowers everywhere!
Dad.
Want some tea?
Sure.
Here.
Thanks.
Dad.
Want to play a game?
Dad.
[zoni soup: a broth eaten with rice cakes; New Year's meal]
Want some zoni soup?
Dad!
NEW YEAR'S
ALLOWANCE
Kinda like that.
Apparently, he likes how I keep scurrying over until I get my money.
I'm exhausted.
Well, yeah...
You guys are really close, huh?
And I managed to get my money...
...so I'm planning on going to Gamers right now.
Really...
The fact that all of those shops are in the city is a pain.
I'm already on a tight budget.
And there's the train fee.
I wish they'd open a shop near us.
But don't a lot of stores sell online now?
So you could try that.
You don't get it...
You can get points when you order online...
...but browsing through the store and
making unexpected discoveries is what's really fun.
What's with you?!
You're totally ready to spend it all!
The radishes are almost completely done!
Now we'll put this completely in.
I wonder why this is called a pochi bag.
[Note: pochitto - a smidge | korepocchi - just a bit]
That's from the phrases pochitto and korepocchi.
It refers to a bag you put small stuff in.
Pochitto would be Kansai...
...and korepocchi would be Kanto.
Happy New Year!
This is Takara.
Miyuki-san.
Happy New Year!
Anyway...
...I was wondering where the name pochi bag came from...
Konata...
Pochi bag, is it?
Can't you have a little more faith in your father?
I believe it came from the phrases pochitto and korepocchi...
And couldn't you do that somewhere out of sight?
...and refers to a bag for small items.
Okay.
Time to wish everyone in the game a happy new year.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
In the end I wasn't able to buy any Haruhi goods...
don't cry!
Your friend konakona has just logged in.
oh?
Happy New Years!
Happy New Years! >w
Same lololol
Finally got on. Been busy for a while
Your friend nanakon has just logged in.
It's Teacher.
Happy New Years, Teacher!
Yo! Happy New Years! (^w^)ノ
Let's have another wonderful year!
mmhmm, lets! (>w
And like...
She's always online...
Doesn't she have anything else to do?
Guess that's why she doesn't have a boyfriend.
Go—
Good lucky!
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shirashi!
We're already on the twelfth episode of Lucky Channel!
This sea is hell.
Uh.
Yeah...
As you can see...
...Akira-sama was supposed to
appear in the actual show this week...
...but she suddenly became ill...
A cold, right?
But I put up a cardboard pop-up instead...
...so if you go look carefully...
Hey.
Akira-sama?
And so...
...it looks like Akira-sama's already tired...
...so we'll have to call it a day!
Okay, everyone.
Bye-bee!
I'm absolutely not getting full of myself.
Let you hear the new version of Take it! Sailor Uniform?
So look forward to it?
If you don't watch next week...
...I'll turn into Mars and scold you!
Fumoffu!
We got pretty into it.
That was fun.
Nobody's ordered a song!
Isn't it your turn?
Now is when you're supposed to order a song.
I didn't choose one!
Which one should I do?
I'll look, too.
There's also a menu.
So you can also eat here.
Yep.
That song totally broke my flow.
Should have saved it for later.
What flow?
You know what I mean?
How you sometimes feel like you sing better?
No idea.
Wonder if I can sing this.
Hey!
Godman!
Can you hear me?
There's a tambourine here.
Hey!
We can play it.
Godman!
Fly to me!
Yuki-chan!
Try this!
Sounds nice.
Okay!
This one!
Even a hardcore anime song will work.
Just go.
Anyway, I ordered an exciting one.
You should know this one.
I do!
I'll try it.
Do—
Oops. Screwed up.
It was spur of the moment...
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Miyuki.
When something has completely outstripped the competition...
...and stands heads above the rest...
...we use the word dantotsu to describe it.
That's apparently short for danzen (on the very) top.
This word first appeared in literature...
...after the recent city election...
...where that person won by a landslide...
...on the very top.
Next time:
Savory Day.
「Savory Day」
Look forward to next time!
Hey!
Everyone, have a seat!
Happy New Year.
The year just flew by, didn't it?
Let's have another good one!
'Course...
...I'll be bidding farewell to some
of you guys in three more months.
Guess who I'm talking about.
Teacher!
You don't mean me, right?!
Savory
Day
I can believe, right?!
People always talk about the New Year's mood...
...but I guess there's kind of a weird atmosphere.
But it changes the second school starts.
Unfortunately...
Well...
It's true that New Years wields a mysterious power.
Despite the fact that I spent the first three
days of the year busy working at home...
...I gained weight!
New Year's magic, huh?
The cold weather makes it difficult to burn off your fat.
I did a lot of moving around, though.
Three days of busy work as a shrine maiden.
But you ate just as much, didn't you?
Shrine maiden. New Year's food!
Shrine maiden. Zoni soup!
Shrine maiden. Snacks!
Snacks! Snacks! Snacks!
Shrine maiden. Snacks!
Something like that.
But the pictures of having fun during New Year's...
...usually include badminton...
...One Hundred Poets...
...and kite flying...
...but I've never actually seen someone do those.
Well...
These days, it's dangerous with stuff like electric lines and cars.
I just watched TV and read books.
After those first three busy days.
Um...
I did those.
I enjoyed badminton, One Hundred
Poets, and Pin the Tail on the Donkey.
Doesn't match your image.
My family follows western customs...
...but our relatives in the country are more traditional.
We wore kimonos and went to the temple on New Year's...
...and I had fun with my cousins.
An omnipotent god...
Way more Japanese than I am!
More traditional than my family!
Wait, why Pin the Tail on the Donkey?
In One Hundred Poets...
...they're all 31 syllable poems, right?
Yes.
You read out the first verse...
...and look for the card with the rest of the poem.
You must have skills...
Not at all.
I'm just a beginner.
The experts snatch up the cards in a flash.
Well, more like...
I can't stand playing a game that
makes you feel like you're studying.
People like you who view mental games as a
chore are why Japan's going down the drain.
Why couldn't they use One Hundred Poets for like a card battle?
You could summon a monk.
Think there was a Semimaru!
Semimaru uses a shining attack!
Ono no Komachi uses a lovely strike!
Doesn't that sound fun?
Back to your world, huh?
But wouldn't more physical
games have helped you lose weight?
Be quiet!
It was those stupid rice cakes...
Rice cakes are loaded with calories, aren't they?
One as big as a matchbox...
...is equivalent to a whole bowl of rice.
Which means that Kagami's eating a bowl of rice with each bite?!
Hey!
You also ate rice cakes, didn't you?!
[zoni soup - a broth eaten with rice cakes; New Year's meal]
My mom's gone, so I've rarely had zoni soup and that stuff.
Actually, I don't really eat rice cakes.
That's a waste.
With zoni soup, sweet red bean soup, soy flour rice cakes...
There are so many fun ways to eat them.
Looks like she's gonna lose to the rice cakes again next year...
...Kagami.
What do you have to eat for New Year's...
...instead of rice cakes, Izumi-san?
Stuff like pizza and pasta.
Our year starts with raw pasta.
My dad cleans out the pasta machine at the end of every year.
Did you know?
That thing rusts if you don't use it for a while.
If you use it without cleaning it first...
...the pasta ends up all black and stuff...
So we clean it out...
...and make pasta and pizza!
Sounds very thorough.
Well, Kagami's house probably orders
pizza, and their pasta consists of cup noodles.
More like...
We don't have pizza or pasta on New Year's...
No way!
It doesn't go with traditional foods.
Sure it does!
It goes great with roast chicken!
That's a traditional New Year's food?
Sure it is.
Under western traditions.
That's how it works?
What did you have for New Year's, Miyuki-san?
Me?
Your family sounds all wealthy and western...
...so you probably didn't have traditional stuff or rice cakes.
Maybe you had like a full course French dinner!
Not at all.
I ate traditional foods...
...and I was unable to bite through a rice cake...
...and it stretched like whee!
What's with this walking pillar of moe?
Rice cake goes whee!
But New Year's goes by so fast.
Yeah.
Winter break goes by fast, too.
It's supposed to be a long vacation...
...but after cleaning, writing
New Year's cards, and homework...
...you don't have much time to relax, right?
Hold it right there!
You didn't do New Year's cards this year!
And you copied my homework yesterday!
Oh, yeah.
Did you have your first dream of the year, Kona-chan?
Isn't it supposed to be a good
omen if you dream about certain things?
Yep, yep.
Usually, it's one: Mt. Fuji, two: hawk, three: eggplant.
Officially, you would add...
...four: fan, five: tobacco, six: blind man.
It goes all the way up to six!
But you know...
Who ever dreams about that kind of stuff?
What kind of dream would that be?
And why a blind man?
Pretty much...
Hey.
Do you have to dream about all of those at once?
If all of those showed up in your dreams,
you'd be really blessed...
...but I believe that just one will suffice.
I thought you would have to dream about
a hawk twice and an eggplant three times.
And quite frankly...
Who really remembers what they dream about?
People who care about that stuff are
having way too much fun with New Year's.
You have a point.
In my first dream this year...
...I opened my shoe locker to find my shoes missing.
So I had no choice but to take
shoes from someone else's open locker...
...but the size was wrong.
I looked up the meaning of this dream in
the encyclopedia for dream fortune telling...
...and it said that it's a sign I am
pursuing skills useful to society...
...but it will take a while before I accomplish that goal.
The shoes apparently represent societal standing.
Cheesecake?
Miyuki-san's...
...pretty ambitious.
It's like I kinda understand, but kinda not...
Another person was goofing off on the stage...
...during the coming-of-age ceremony.
Don't they realize they're representing Japan?
Makes you wonder why they even bother going.
No kidding.
I wouldn't want to go to a boring coming-of-age ceremony.
And this girl's gonna grow up to be a bad person.
What are you guys going to wear to your ceremony?
Might as well go with a long-sleeve kimono...
What about you?
Well...
My dad's probably going to have
me wear a long-sleeve kimono.
I can see him doing that.
Yahoo!
But...
When you wear one...
...you'd look more like a little kid going to the festival.
Happy New Year!
Hope ya had fun!
Happy New Year, Cousin Yui.
I haven't seen you in a while.
Well, my husband was here.
And a lot happens during New Year's.
Oh, and my sister had a fever.
She's got a weak body.
Whoa!
It definitely wasn't because I didn't
give her any New Year's allowance!
Don't get the wrong idea!
Only a cop would reveal what she was
really thinking before I've said a thing.
A One Hundred Poets tournament is currently underway...
...and it's been one crazy ride so far.
Oh, yeah.
What did you do on New Year's when you were a kid?
When I was a kid?
Well, I did all kinds of stuff...
Let's see...
Um...
Dot.
Dot.
Dot.
Dot.
Sorry.
I forgot.
No clue.
She really just goes with the flow.
I've never heard her say anything serious.
Guess I outgrew my memories!
Tsukasa's always cooped up under the kotatsu these days.
'Cause it's cold.
I know what you mean!
Kotatsus are so wonderful.
Going to the bathroom's a pain, though.
Yep, yep.
But you shouldn't say that so loudly...
But we have a surefire way to get a person out of a kotatsu.
How does it work?
Konata.
If you stay under the kotatsu too long...
...you'll get stuck.
So your dad doesn't need a kotatsu.
He likes them as much as anyone else.
It's just like a warning.
'Cause we've both fallen asleep
together under the kotatsu before.
I know what you mean!
But they say that you'll catch a
cold if you fall asleep under a kotatsu.
Yeah.
So we turn it off once someone notices.
It's like a mix of heaven and hell.
Like right before you turn it on...
...and after you turn it off, it feels even colder.
I totally know what you mean!
And doesn't it really suck when you get out of bed in the morning?
While we're at it, it's totally freezing after you
get undressed and before you get in the bath.
But not enough to make you run.
You might slip and fall.
And doesn't it suck when you need to go
the bathroom in the middle of the night?
I hate that!
Hey.
This is our stop.
And the walk from the bus to the classroom is also hell.
It's almost Valentine's Day.
It always gets a lot more exciting this time of year.
Every year, it's awkward how everyone tries to act normal...
...but you can still feel the tension in the air.
Having someone special on that day...
...and confessing your feelings...
...and having them reciprocated...
...is a beautiful thing.
You're such a girl.
I just see it as a conspiracy by the chocolate industry.
Well, I guess you could say it's also a special time of year for me.
They have a sale on the unsold chocolate afterwards...
...so I go after the chocolate power to make my own.
And you, you have no dreams.
Money can't buy love!
At least, that's what they like to say...
...but isn't Valentine chocolate a
way of showing love through money?
I guess someone who's only
experienced love in games has some harsh views.
Well, in games, it's all about upping
your relationship level before the day comes.
I don't do anything special for Valentine's.
Guys dream too much.
Nobody managed to trigger the Kagami flag.
What about you?
I'm super popular!
Right...
In your game.
When you talk about flags and relationship levels...
...I seriously get worried about your future.
You can't limit yourself to events in games.
I can't stand those narrow-minded people
who don't know what they're talking about.
So I'm wrong?
Lately, events only take a few hours in game time...
...so Valentine's Day is usually over in a flash.
So what?
But this year, I'm planning on giving chocolate to someone.
Seriously?!
Someone playing the same online game as me.
A friend from your game?
You're giving it to him in person?
I'm not actually going to meet the person.
It'll be in-game.
Since the characters are still human.
Does that even count?
So you just meant a game character.
How dare you insult my bride!
Bride?
We're married in-game, and my character's male.
What?
Wait a sec.
So the guy is giving the girl chocolate?
And wouldn't it be like a girl giving a girl chocolate?
If the other person's a girl...
Don't worry.
The other person's a guy in real life.
Guess it doesn't matter as long as you're having fun!
Got that right.
I wanna go overseas.
That came out of nowhere.
Well, yesterday, Miyuki-san was like...
Females giving chocolates on February 14th is a Japanese custom.
Miyuki-san!
In western society, people of both genders...
...give chocolate and cards to friends and people they like.
That's what she said...
...so a girl like me could still get lots of chocolate!
I guess you could interpret it that way...
...but you sure have a lot of confidence in yourself.
Like you already know for a fact that you'll be popular.
Don't worry.
In foreign countries, little girls...
Okay, stop!
No risqué statements allowed!
Uh...
Will you accept this?!
Happy Valentine's Day!
Here, Kona-chan.
Incredible wrapping...
...for a uniform...
And the inside's all cool and heart-shaped!
I put some effort into it.
Tsukasa's always enthusiastic about this kind of stuff.
She was making them until morning.
And it's only friendship chocolate.
Tsukasa.
You shouldn't give any friendship chocolate to guys.
They'll definitely get the wrong idea.
What?
Anyway, here.
Kagami's giving me chocolate!
Tsukasa was making hers...
...so I just joined in.
You don't want it?
The fact that you always look skilled, but secretly work behind the scenes is so moe!
Zip it!
Shut up and put it away.
Huh?
Kagami?
Here.
This is for you.
Just so you know, it's a just friends thing.
Friendship chocolate.
S-Sorry the shape's funny.
Silly.
The shape isn't important.
What matters is that you made it for me.
S-Stupid.
I told you it's not like that.
Nothing like that?
No.
Just shut up and put it away.
This is my first time.
The first time's the most important.
So did you give anybody chocolate, Miyuki-san?
I gave chocolate to my father and a relative.
I gave chocolate to everybody I'm friendly with.
I gave chocolate to you, Tsukasa, and Miyuki.
Sheesh.
You guys sure had a boring St. Valentine's Day.
Don't need to hear it from someone who lives in an online game.
Oh, yeah.
Your cousin was accepted to Ryouou, right?
She was.
It's pretty far from her home...
...so she'll be living with us starting next month.
She's always been like a little sister anyway...
...so we've been in touch.
Really.
But next to you...
...nobody would be able to tell who's younger.
No, like I said...
She's like a little sister in more ways than one.
She's that small?!
But if she got accepted to our school...
...your cousin must be really smart.
That just sounds like you're being really presumptuous.
Since you're a student here.
But I barely passed the exam.
Exams, huh?
We'll be taking our exams next year.
Guess I'll be spending the whole year studying.
Sounds awful.
Exams...
Should I even take them?
I haven't even picked a major.
You seriously need to start thinking about your future.
Studying, manual labor, and me just don't mix.
What kind of future do you have in mind?
Use a hobby to make profit and make games...
I design games. 'Cause it's my hobby.
Be a self-proclaimed manga artist who can only sell at Comiket...
Megas smoked cheese-nyoro.
Or perhaps, indulge your curiosity
and become a professional writer.
There can only be one truth!
And this isn't it!
No, maybe just a novelist who aims for a niche market.
Since you like computers, I guess art design might work.
Maybe a scenario writer who uses
random material instead of an actual story writer.
Or she doesn't go to college...
Or they're all the same thing?!
What?
What is it?
Manager!
Legendary Girl A...
...has returned!
What?!
She shook us off last time!
Manager!
Manager!
Manager!
Today!
We will absolutely make sure she
reaches the goal known as our register!
Gero.
She seems to be at a loss.
Then allow us to...
...help her find her way!
Okay, everyone!
Let 'er rip!
Okay!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go!
Yeah!
Let's go!
Aw yeah!
Manager.
Attempting to determine Legendary Girl A's objective for the day.
Okay.
Countin' on you.
What's the newest comic out?
Yes.
Volume 14 of Sgt. Frog, sah!
Okay!
Raise the height of our goods to the appropriate level...
...to bring them to the attention of Legendary Girl A!
Okay!
And deploy the flyers!
Tama!
Deployment complete!
Sah!
Okay.
Keep an eye on her movements.
And as Legendary Girl A approaches the register...
...deploy our best-selling goods!
Roger!
Sah!
Okay.
Manager!
Legendary Girl A's objective isn't the comics section!
What?!
Manager.
Switch target to the DVD section.
Okay.
Just to be sure...
...block all side paths so Legendary Girl A...
...heads straight to the new DVD section!
Roger!
Sah!
So sorry!
Tama! Tama!
Oh, my!
Forgive me!
Gero-gero-gero build-up!
Tama-tama-tama build-up!
Okay, okay...
Manager!
She's...
...picked up the item!
I've finally become a winner today!
Comrades!
Let us have a wild celebration tonight!
Yes!
Sah!
It was a feint!
Cheap!!
I'll have to bring out my trump card!
Come...
Bring that bargain, super-rare, out-of-print DVD to me.
Manager.
She is heading for the register.
Okay.
Keep going!
What a beautiful scene!
The crowd inside me is cheering with applause right now!
We did it!
Sah!
Your total comes to 1,785 yen.
I'm short 3 yen.
Sorry.
Please put that back.
We'll be back!
Good lucky!
Okay!
Let's kick this into gear!
We're already on the thirteenth episode of Lucky Channel!
Okay.
As you already know, I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
And...
Yes.
D-D-Drill!
I'm Akira-sama's assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
D-D-Drill!
It's a pleasure!
That's right.
D-D-Drill!
We're on episode 13.
D-D-D-D-Drill!
Into the second season.
D-D-Drill!
It's like we've reached the fifth station on Mt. Fuji, right?
D-D-Drill!
D-D-D-D-Drill!
Mt. Fuji?
You can drive up to the fifth station.
That's true...
That's right!
I've climbed Mt. Takao before!
Don't you have something else to talk about?
That's true...
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Drill!
Man, uh...
Akira-sama's twin drills look wonderful!
What's so wonderful about them?
The way they go round and round like a shell.
Well...
Uh...
We have a special announcement today.
The results for the Lucky Star figure poll!
Let's have Akira-sama announce the results!
The characters that will soon be getting figures are Konata Izumi...
Akira-sama, do a proper job!
Congratulations!
Sheesh, everybody knew this would happen.
What a joke.
No, no, no...
Just means that the higher-ups think the
actual show is more important than this corner.
Of course not, right?
Look.
The producers agree.
Yeah.
I'll just fall for your little trick.
I'm already used to being backstabbed.
Little trick?
That's an awful thing to say.
And don't tell me that it says you're going to have a figure made.
Of course not!
Okay.
We'll be making a figure of Konata Izumi-san this time.
And the popular Minoru Shiraishi will also get a figure?!
The hell is this?!
U-Uh...
It's time to say goodbye!
So please send us any suggestions or
comments you have about the show!
You can leave them on our home page.
Right, Akira-sama?
I'm leaving.
Er, what?
W-Wait!
B-Bye-bee!
Akira-sama!
Wait up!
Okay.
All the staff members can go home.
D-Drill!
Clap for no reason
Clap for no reason
Clap for no reason
Clap for no reason
For-for-for-forgot something.
Forgot...
Forgot my something.
That fragment of memory I left behind on that day.
It's disappeared.
Along with that girl.
The red sunset was so brilliant.
He's annoying
Don't look him in the eyes
On romantic Jogashima.
Couple who readily agreed to be in the production.
Go ahead and laugh at me for being an idiot.
That's how it should be.
Unsurpassable Wall

Every now and then...
...give me a gentle embrace.
Shiraishi couldn't have?!
Coward
Next Episode
Well, next time on Sgt. Frog:
No!
You mean next time on Lucky Star!
Gero-gero.
Comrade, I have a good idea!
Japanese anime is now a global industry.
If we use it to brainwash the people on Pekopon...
...we can complete the invasion of Pekopon in no time, sah!
You're a genius, Sarge!
Worthless.
A soldier should act like a soldier and use brute force!
Shut your mouth, you red dharma doll!
In this age, whoever controls information controls the battle!
Well, your prehistoric mind wouldn't understand that.
You better watch yourself!
In any case...
「Under One Roof」
Next time:
Under One Roof.
Look forward to next time!
G-Gero!
Yutaka!
It's almost time to go!
Oof.
Okay, little sister of mine.
Today's the beginning of your new life!
Let's go with a bang!
Under
One
Roof
I'm here to report that Yutaka's passed and say hi!
Welcome.
Come on, Yutaka.
I-I'll probably be causing lots of trouble...
...but I hope we can get along well!
Just think of this as your own home.
Yes.
Let me start by congratulating you on passing.
Thank you!
It's a good thing she passed.
Now you can meet that handkerchief girl.
I win at life.
Going back in time
The day of Yutaka's Exams
Um...
Are you all right?
Do you want me to take you to the nurse's office?
Right after the exams
So she talked to me...
...and even lent me her handkerchief!
I'm so happy that I might be able to make a good friend.
But Yutaka...
She might've failed.
That won't happen!
People like her definitely pass!
I know how you feel...
She's definitely smart!
Thank you for the baseless rebuttal.
But you know...
...Yu-chan.
What if you fail?
That's actually possible...
Well, you should be fine.
That's right.
I should be able to meet her on the
day they announce results regardless.
I see.
I have to return the handkerchief.
You will be notified of your results by mail.
And then
the day of orientation and uniform fitting
E-Excuse me!
Here.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I've been wanting to return this.
You came to deliver this?
Yes.
I guess I ended up troubling you.
I didn't expect to ever see you again.
I never intended to have this returned.
I was worried I might fail.
Oh.
I see.
If you're here now...
...you're in the same year.
I'm sorry.
You probably thought I was someone's little sister.
I came by car today.
O-Okay.
Then we'll be parting here.
Um...
I hope we can have a great three years!
What a relief.
I already became friends with such a nice person in high school.
I didn't ask what her name was.
Turning back the clock
Make sure you ask for her name next time.
Present
Are you feeling sick, Yu-chan?
I think I got a little carsick.
I took some medicine, though...
Sorry to worry you.
Yutaka's got such a weak body.
Wait.
That's part of it...
I'll rub your back—
...but you need to realize what your driving's like, Cousin Yui.
Thanks~
Even I get a little blargh...
But I'm the only one from my old school who's going to Ryouou...
And I'll probably get sick again like today...
I'm worried about if I can get along with my classmates.
You're a good girl, so it'll be fine.
You're treating me like a child!
Sickly
Little Sister
Brain...
Pure
Cute
...converting...
Walking Pillar of Moe
If Yu-chan got together with our Miyuki-san, it'd be pretty crazy.
That's right.
I'm in Big Sister Konata's house now.
Big Sister.
Good morning!
You're up awfully early when we don't have school.
Morning.
Actually, I'm about to hit the sack.
I was gaming all nigh—
This really is a different environment!
We have to take exams next year, huh?
We've been getting a bunch of phone calls from cram schools.
It's a pain.
If you use caller ID...
...you should be able to pick out those kinds of calls immediately.
Since they use unlisted numbers.
I'm home!
Caller ID, huh...
I've come home!
My...
Is that so?
That must have been difficult.
Not at all...
It's the same for our family.
Well, my daughter's returned...
Yes.
Until we talk again, then.
Sorry to have taken up your time.
Who was on the phone?
It sounded like you were having a lively conversation.
It was a telemarketer.
Um...
Didn't you say that you could pick out those calls immediately?
But you know...
I was bored and felt like having a conversation.
We talked for over an hour.
This should be your total.
Whyistherealreadyanewitem?!
What's wrong, Kona-chan?
Tsukasa!
This world is always a battlefield!
You can never show mercy!
The other day, there was a little item I wanted...
Should I exchange my points.
I spent half a day thinking about it...
...Nah...but
there's other stuff I want.
Okay!
...and ended up deciding to exchange my points...
I'll go on the offensive!
But now there's already a new item I really want!
Look! Over there!
I don't have enough points left!
What to do?!
You sure enjoy your life.
Uh...
You haven't paid...
Would you prefer smoking or non-smoking?
Well...
We're minors...
...so a non-smoking table, please.
Then please follow me.
I'm going to the restroom first.
Hey, Tsukasa!
Over here!
Welcome back.
I'm back.
Hey...
I've been wondering...
Why are the restrooms in these places...
...usually located near the smoking section?
That's true.
Especially when we're in the non-smoking section.
But really...
I wonder why...
So there's a nearby water source if a fire starts.
They have buckets and hoses, too.
They even have hoses?
They do!
They sure do!
Typical of a person who's never worked out in the real world.
What a pain.
Good grief.
You're annoying!
Or maybe to cover up the stink.
And like...
Don't talk about this stuff while we're eating.
Stuff like the stink or restrooms...
Currently, in the city...
...a number of elementary school girls...
...have been approached from
behind while on their way to school...
There are a lot more cases of kids being targeted.
You should be careful, Yu-chan.
That's right.
You have to!
Well, I can understand the perpetrator's way of thinking...
Really...
He's been all over the news for consecutive days now...
...yet he's still going up to little kids?!
What does he want?!
I really want to tell him something!
Man, I'm jealous.
I have no idea what you're thinking...
...but don't do anything that'll get you arrested by Cousin Yui.
Excuse me!
Coming!
Hey!
I'm here!
Welcome!
Oh, where's Kagami today?
She went out with some friends from her class.
I see.
I'm kinda annoyed and then it feels like something's missing...
I guess you're lonely.
It's gotten really warm lately.
Sure has.
We don't have any homework for spring break...
...so it's really tranquil.
Sure is.
Pretty sure that...
...only people who normally work hard have the right to say that.
Don't hit any place weird!
No more!
Say...
Do you even recognize the characters in these robot games?
Some of them.
I see...
Since your manga and anime preferences...
...were influenced by your dad.
Yep.
In that case...
Didn't you have a hard time understanding what your female friends were talking about when you were little?
Why?
I actually saw more of that kind of
stuff, so there wasn't any problem.
Really...
Huh?
Is that your final answer?
Final answer!
Why can't they just tell us?
I couldn't even breathe.
And his face is scary.
And huge.
Looking at the clock, she must have gotten the question wrong.
The show's already over.
Wait, Tsukasa!
Can you stop guessing if they got the question right based on the amount of time left when they cut to commercial?!
But I can't take the waiting...
And they really drag it out...
Isn't that the point of the show?!
But it's what Tsukasa would do.
Yo.
Yahoo!
Let me introduce you.
This is my cousin, Yu-chan.
N-Nice to meet you.
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
These are my friends Tsukasa and Kagami.
Then you're the ones Big Sister's always talking about...
What does she say about us?
Hey.
What did you tell her?
Though I can guess from her reaction...
See?
Just like I told you.
Did you already have your graduation ceremony, Yutaka-chan?
Yes.
A few days ago.
Graduation, huh?
Brings back memories.
I don't even remember our graduation.
Did you get a second button from anyone, Yutaka-chan?
No, I didn't.
Our middle school uniform was a blazer.
Oh, yeah...
I guess a lot more schools are like that now.
Actually...
...does the practice of getting
something from the person you like still exist?
Really?
That's kinda sad.
Not that I ever did it.
If you read blogs...
...it looks like quite a few people are still doing it.
But you know...
You take it from someone you like, right?
Well, in most cases.
Then...
...wouldn't going to get a button be
the same as confessing how you feel?
Wouldn't it be better to just confess
and get the guy instead of a button?
Ideally, sure.
That's right.
Did you like anyone at your old school?
No.
I was often absent from school...
When I did go, I would soon get sick.
I just made everyone feel bad.
And I'm all small...
...and I look like a child...
...so everyone always teased me.
I never had time to like anybody...
Don't worry!
You'll have no problems if you aren't picky!
Wh-What?!
Pocky!
Yu-chan.
Show me your graduation yearbook.
I wanna see it!
This is kinda embarrassing.
I don't show up very often.
Yu-chan, what class were you in?
You checked the absentee section first, didn't you?!
You could tell?
The differences between middle school and high school?
The fact that joining a club is no longer mandatory.
Doesn't that depend on the school?
Our school's geared towards getting into college...
...so there will probably be more material at a faster pace.
And the commute takes a while...
...so you'll need some stamina.
The decisive difference is that...
...class time naps have grown longer from
grade school to middle school to high school.
Especially during classes you're bad at!
That's actually true!
The teacher sounds like he's talking in a foreign language...
Make sure you don't end up like them.
...and my mind just starts slipping away!
You brought your middle school uniform.
Our uniform is pretty plain...
...so I thought I could wear it normally.
Since I'm no longer close to school.
I see.
What did you guys do with your uniforms?
We gave ours to some younger neighbors.
What about you?
Mine?
Well...
You wouldn't be able to give yours to anyone.
Be quiet.
How rude.
I saved mine for cosplay use like Yu-chan.
C-Cos..?
When you put it that way...
...it really gets on my nerves.
But it's cosplay.
Anyway...
Our old school, huh?
Now that you've brought it up...
...I kind of want to go visit my grade school and middle school.
But there have been a bunch of incidents involving trespassing...
...so people might give you funny looks.
Well, you don't have to worry.
You'll fit in just fine.
Pretty sure that wasn't a compliment.
But vacations sure pass by quickly.
That's true.
Before you know it, it's back to school.
Spring is a pain with physical exams and measurements.
But you've got really athletic nerves. Lucky you.
Hey, Tsukasa.
Which nerves are the athletic nerves?
Hello, everyone!
I'm a little late...
...but congratulations on graduating, Yutaka!
Cousin Yui.
Welcome.
To celebrate...
...let's all go get smashed!
Invite your dad, too.
My treat!
Sis!
We can't do that!
Sis!
Officer, we're still minors.
W-We can't!
She means juice~
Sis.
I don't think we can go in those places yet.
If you just stroll on in...
...they'll never catch you!
I did it all the time when I was a student!
They never caught me once!
No.
We can't!
Your two relatives will get us caught.
So you did~
We can't, Sis!
I see...
Don't mind.
Since Yu-chan's here...
...we could go to Disneyland or something.
Since it's spring break.
Um...
I really appreciate it...
...but I'm already imposing...
...so you don't have to go so far.
And I already went there on a school field trip a while back.
Yeah, I had a field trip like that, too.
But were you okay?
I didn't get sick.
It was fun!
And I was with my friends.
No...
I was talking about the minimum height for rides.
It was okay!
I'm in high school now!
So I was watching this school drama...
...when I realized there are a lot of
differences between middle school and high school.
Guess so.
They stop feeding you in high school.
That's right.
You make your own lunch or eat in the cafeteria.
Or buy a lunch to bring.
Do you make a box lunch every day?!
P-Pretty much.
That's amazing!
This could get ugly...
You're really good at games!
Skilled at many forms of communication!
You can even cook and do other housework!
I've recently learned how much pressure an older sister feels.
You have to work hard with those eyes on you, right...
...Kagami?
Cousin Yui, wild at the wheel.
Hey!
Doing good?
Cousin Yui, comes home drunk.
Homework?
Just put down something random.
Cousin Yui, never serious about anything.
But I guess it depends on the person.
Make it so I can understand you.
Final answer!
Man, I seriously can't take this.
I finally get to record a line for the actual show...
...but I wasn't even on screen!
Doing it again today.
What are they thinking when they make this show?
Again.
Why am I stuck with this lame crap anybody could come up with...
Akira-sama!
The title call.
Title call!
U-U-Uh...
The title call...
Tiny eyes!
Good lucky...
This isn't the time for that.
Unbelievable. Incredible.
Only my voice. My voice.
My appearance was pointless.
U-Uh...
I wasn't on screen either.
Nobody gives a damn about you!
Windy, huh?
Hey...
Did I ask about you?
Hey.
Did I ever mention you?
N-No...
You didn't say a word about me.
So why did you bring yourself up?
Don't be so self-centered.
Are you an idiot?
You're always like me, me, me.
That's called being overly self-conscious.
Make yourself scarce, Shiraishi.
Sheesh, I'm gonna end up with a dirty mouth.
Listen up.
The issue here is the fact that Akira
Kogami wasn't shown in the actual show.
Sure is.
Let me ask you. What am I?
An idol, right?
An idol depends on her looks, right?
Isn't it a given that I should be on screen?
What do you think?
Y-Yes!
You're absolutely right, sah!
I can't hear you.
T-The staff for this episode...
...acted in a logic-defying manner, sah!
What are you writing?
Revenge of Akira Kogami
Project Full Appearance in Actual Show!!!
Okay?
Here's a request from Akira!
Akira needs everybody's support to appear in the actual show.
The world is waiting for Akira!
Please show your support on the home page
and other places
So send in loads of encouragement!
Loads...
Any method works!
Just give them a push!
Say that you're dying to see me appear in the actual show!
Dying...
Just between you and me.
The other members of the cast...
...can't hold a candle...
...to a performance that features Akira's amazing talent and charm!
She's desperate...
She's really desperate today...
You can't wait to see such a pretty and gorgeous performance!
This is your chance!
Don't let it slip away!
Your feedback...
...can make this a reality!
What is it?
So the second this show ends, start getting to work...
Stop her?
Understood.
Um, Akira-sama...
Shut up!
Stop butting in!
I was on a roll!
How many times do I have to tell you not to get in my way?!
What? Already?
I wanted to tell you more about how wonderful Akira is.
You can see a lot more of my true
charm during next week's actual show.
Just kidding.
Uh...
Look forward to next time!
Bye-bee!
It's over.
I'm in pain.
Hey, you.
Go get the producer!
Me?!
First of all...
Yes.
This week's modified manuscript was wrong.
What's the name of this program?!
Uh, Lucky Channel?
It said Lucky Paradise.
Well...
Also...
What is it?
You've got guts to treat me like this!
Just because your last show was a hit!
Hey, producers!
Wait, you really shouldn't be saying that!
Don't mess with me!
Hey!
Miyagi-san!
Hello, I'm Shiraishi!
Okay! Please listen to me!
I've lived my life wishing for excitement.
Who made my dream come true?
Some futures you can guess. Some you can't.
But there's still one thing I know for sure.
Even to the end of time!
Boooon!!
These looping feelings...
...warp everyone in to play with imagination!
One clear, sunshiny day...
...happiness greater than magic...
...pours down with no end in sight.
It could happen!
When we meet again tomorrow...
...we'll be smiling and humming!
Let's bring together happiness!
It's an easy thing to do!
Keep on chasing!
Try to catch it!
We love big dreams, right?
The End
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Minami Iwasaki.
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
Iwasaki-san.
The two of us are supposed to introduce the next episode.
Do you know what it's about?
I don't.
Sorry.
Really?
That's not good.
I don't know either.
Then we'll stop here.
Next time:
「Can't Change So Quickly」
Can't Change So Quickly.
Is it okay that we didn't say anything?
Look forward to next time.

Hey...
What are we in line for?
Do you know, Yuki-chan?
No idea...
Now, now...
Try again
The Jam of Haruhi Suzumiya
Early Ticket Sale Drawing
There you have it.
Too bad.
I didn't win either.
Um...
I drew a winner.
Me too!
My true friends!
What about me?
I'm gonna follow you through.
No matter the pain.
Through the darkeness of this world if I must.
Big guy blocking...
'Cause you'll be there to shine the way.
Past the end of the future.
Here.
Won't let weakness...
...break down my soul.
That was incredible.
I was quite moved.
The first person who came out was so cool.
That guy?
No?
People actually go for that, huh?
Konata, you haven't said a word.
The whole fatigue setting in after an event's over thing, huh?
I guess I was a bit moved myself.
I wonder what this feeling is...
Can't
Change
So
Quickly
What are you doing?
Come on. We're going now.
You're really proactive about some odd things.
Because today's our last chance to
see the cherry blossoms in full bloom.
When you put something off to tomorrow...
...or the day after...
...it ends up raining...
...or the petals start falling.
Oh, yeah.
What happened to the goldfish from the summer festival?
Actually...
...I ended up feeding it too much...
...and it ended up like this.
Huge!
Shogun?!
I took a little too good care of it.
Wait a minute.
Are you sure you didn't feed it something funny?
That's no longer a goldfish!
I can only pray that it's because he's living a good life.
Are you going to eat it?
How could I?!
There's an anime where animals a guy took
good care of return as humans to serve him.
You always bring up hardcore references.
I should probably put it on a diet...
Kagami.
Goldfish Scooping
Are you thinking about getting a replacement?
It's gotten pretty chilly.
We should probably head home.
When you wear daytime clothes to see
nighttime cherry blossoms, it gets cold.
And your butt gets cold when you sit down.
I've heard that the average temperature in March...
...is close to the average temperature in December...
...and April and November are quite similar.
If it were November or December, I'd definitely wear a lot more.
In March and April...
...you just tend to dress lighter.
Isn't it because you're sick of wearing winter clothes?
Maybe it's a way of expressing
how you want it to be spring already.
You look like you're fine, Kagami.
Maybe it's because you're wearing...
Long-wavelength infrared effect
Came prepared.
I'm not wearing any!
That's all you get today, Goldy.
It'd be a problem...
...if he showed up as a wife beater...
As if...
What's wrong with Sis?
Man, that really stings...
I have really sensitive skin.
This season is brutal for me.
Sounds like a pain.
And I stay in the house most of the time.
They have a lot of goods that help for allergies.
Why don't you buy some?
Transform!
I see!
This works!
Reduces the effects of allergies by 99%!
Now he's suspicious on the outside and the inside.
Don't get in trouble with the police.
I'm going to go do some shopping.
Have fun!
Want to come along?
Nope!
Wait, Dad.
You're going shopping like that?
Of course.
Or it'd defeat the purpose.
Here's our next story.
Woman robs convenient store
Last night around eleven...
...a woman broke into a convenience store...
...and attempted to steal the cash.
Hey, Yu-chan.
What is it?
Aren't there a lot more robbers
disguised with allergy gear this time of year?
It sounds possible.
Freeze.
How did this happen?
Tomorrow?
Sure.
Haven't done that in a while.
That's right.
Plus, I'm already done with my homework.
What did you just say?!
You finished your homework?!
For real?!
Unbelievable!
Sorry.
I lied.
Yeah, you know how you have to lie on April Fools'?
Good thing I remembered.
No, seriously...
And you have no intention of doing it, huh?
You must be bored.
You're the only person who would call at this hour just to lie.
Anyway, see you tomorrow.
Yes, this is Izumi.
This is Kuroi.
Is this the Izumi residence?
Teacher.
Izumi, it's me.
Sorry.
I accidentally overwrote a save file...
...on a game I borrowed from you.
Just lying! Hey!
Fooled you!
Today's April Fools'!
There was somebody else as bored as me...
Teacher.
What's up?
The other day, Miyuki-san said...
Even someone like Ms. Kuroi can be a teacher...
...so getting a certificate must be a cakewalk.
...something like that.
That brat...
So the sweet talk was just an act...
Um, Teacher.
I was joking...
Konata called me just so she could lie.
Honestly...
Did you lie to anyone today?
That's unusual.
What was it?
I-I just did.
I lied about lying.
Th-That's hard to get.
And there's no need to force yourself to lie.
Wh-What was Kona-chan's lie like?
Something about finishing her homework on her own.
In retrospect, I really shouldn't have fallen for it.
It's impossible.
If she lied, then she hasn't done her homework yet, right?
Well, knowing her...
...she definitely hasn't done it!
I see...
You were just thinking...
...that it's a good thing you aren't alone, right?
No...
Konata.
Do you have a minute?
Is that interesting?
Unique.
I see.
Konata.
I'm actually thinking about remarrying.
Wait, I know that you're against it.
In your mind, Kanata will always be your only moth—
What?
You're okay with it?
If I get remarried?
Why not?
B-But...
You know...
She'll be your new mother?
What will my new mother be like?
Uh...
Well...
Wh-When you put it that way...
Okay. Here's the next question.
What is the kenjogo form for iku (to go)?
It's gotta be ukagau (to inquire)!
Piece of cake!
That's right.
It's to inquire.
That should be the correct answer.
Sounds right.
The correct answer is mairu (to visit).
O-On second thought, that's right...
Yeah...
I went with the flow there.
What's with the weird atmosphere?
Me too...
This is what happens when you're positive you're right.
Multiple choice quiz, question one.
Which prefecture does not border the ocean?
A. Ibaraki.
B. Tochigi.
C. Kyoto.
It's B!
It's B!
B, right?
This is easy.
The correct answer is B!
Next question.
Of the hardest known problems in mathematics...
...the theorem proven by...
...Princeton's Sir Wiles in 1994 was...
A. The Pythagorean theorem.
B. Taylor's theorem.
C. Fermat's last theorem.
Why is everyone so eager when the answer is obvious...
...but then they keep quiet when they're not sure?
Since it's spring break, we should visit Miyuki-san's house.
That sounds good.
It's pretty far, so I've never been there before.
Miyuki-san's family is rich, right?
I wonder what it's like.
A pool in her backyard?
Nah...
A security fence around the whole place.
No, it's probably a lot more normal.
She probably has a pet.
A ferret might fit her image.
A white one.
Nah, gotta be a dog.
A huge, white dog.
With a huge yard and a white parasol.
She might have a dog.
That's how the conversation went.
You're welcome to visit...
...but please don't expect too much.
I'm sorry to say that I have no pets.
However, while we don't have a big white dog or a parasol...
...one of our neighbors does.
And the neighbor's kid is entering Ryouou this year.
She's also been invited. Do you want to come?
My friend's cousin...
...is entering Ryouou.
It's a small world after all.
S-So sleepy...
Honestly...
It's because you got used to sleeping all morning.
Konata.
Yo.
What?
You also got used to sleeping in?
I've been gaming for three days straight...
I'm about to die...
The only thing they have in common is their laziness!
Miyuki Takara
Minoru Shiraishi
Konata Izumi
Tsukasa Hiiragi
We're in the same class again!
You're right!
That's great.
Good morning.
Good morning, Yuki-chan.
Good morning.
You're in our class.
Indeed.
That's wonderful.
Let's have another great year!
Let's!
Minami Iwasaki
Yutaka Kobayakawa
We're in the same class!
I-I hope we have a wonderful year!
So do I.
Kagami's the only one in a different class again.
I see you guys all the time anyway.
If we weren't in different classes, you'd wear me out.
Sis...
That's too bad...
No big deal.
It's the same as usual.
Besides, someone like Konata...
...will come borrowing notes or textbooks.
You know me well.
So that's that...
Go on ahead.
See you later!
Yo, Hiiragi!
What class you in?
We're in the same class again!
If you count middle school...
...that makes five years straight, right?
Let's have another good year.
Huh?
Some heartless people only look for their top priorities.
There, there.
We're like part of the background!
I wonder how class assignments are decided.
They might try to avoid grouping all the good students together...
...or try to divide up relatives...
...or split up the troublemakers as much as possible.
At least that's what I've heard.
It probably depends on the school.
In TV shows, all the troublemakers end up in one class.
It's more exciting that way.
But high schools are supposed to gather people of the same level...
...so there shouldn't be any big troublemakers.
That's true.
Miyuki...
That's where you say, "You need to
realize that you're a troublemaker."
You don't want to be put on the same level as her, right?
No, that's not true...
The bell already rang.
Teacher sure is late.
That's right.
Everybody, sit down!
Still good.
Barely made it.
No good.
I'm your homeroom teacher, Kuroi.
Now that you've all advanced a year in school...
...stop acting like you're on vacation...
...and start working hard.
Th-That wasn't convincing at all!
Class Representative
First Semester Duties
Well, I won't bug you about studying all the time...
...but this is your last year in high school...
...so I want you to have a meaningful experience.
Okay.
Let's get straight to class duties.
Library Staff
Class Representative
First Semester Duties
Takara.
Can you be class representative for the first semester?
Yes.
Once you've been class rep, it gets attached to your image.
That's true.
Though I don't have any problem with it.
The teacher usually decides roles for the first semester.
Because of all the unfamiliar faces...
...it's hard for the students to choose.
In Ms. Kuroi's case, isn't it less
work for her if she chooses Miyuki-san?
I can hear you.
Teacher's hair was all wild.
But it looks like we'll have another fun class with Ms. Kuroi.
Well, she's a fun person.
The class atmosphere usually depends on the teacher...
I see.
I get it.
So you two are blaming your laziness on your teacher.
I can hear you.
I'm Iwasaki.
Nice to meet you.
That girl's pretty cute.
I was in the same middle school as her.
She never talks.
And she's a downer.
And all she does is read. It's creepy.
But she's actually a really nice person.
So I'm the only one who knows.
I feel a little special.
Next.
Y-Yes!
The first impression is important.
I have to be cheerful.
I'm Yutaka Kobayakawa.
Though I may look this way...
...I didn't skip here from grade school.
Just kidding.
Skipped?
What was that?
H-Huh?
Huh? What?
Did Big Sister's influence turn me into a maniac?
In that case...
I'd like to decide on class duties...
Anybody interested in being class representative?
Guess not.
Iwasaki.
You were class rep in middle school.
Go for it.
Really?
Can you do it, Iwasaki?
I'm sorry.
I'm planning on a different duty.
I'd prefer someone with experience...
What are you planning on?
Working in the library?
The nurse's office.
Teacher!
I'll be class representative!
She's a really nice person!
Cherry blossoms bloom into future, love, and dreams.
Spring...
...tends to gives you the feeling that...
I can't stop my heart from racing.
...something's about to begin.
A new meeting.
Let the two of us spend...
Konata Izumi
A new life.
Konata Izumi
...this touching season together.
Konata Izumi
A new love.
Konata Izumi
This moment of a lifetime...
With your childhood friend...
The upperclassman you admired...
This meeting is the beginning of our story.
Or a strange transfer student...?
Cherry blossom petals dance in the air...
A little anxiety and a lot of expectation...
It's what they call 5 seconds to falling in love.
...carrying our wishes...
Also known as MK5.
That's the happy image you get...
But in reality, you have to start over with people you don't know...
...so it's depressing.
I'm already used to it.
You've got it easy.
Big Sister!
Yu-chan.
Haven't seen you since morning.
That's right.
Not since morning.
Oh.
This is the person I told you about...
The one who helped me.
So you found her.
Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you.
See?
Just like I said.
I knew she would pass.
Okay.
But Yu-chan...
You forgot that she could have passed but chosen not to come.
It worked out in the end, so it's okay!
By the way, what are you doing?
We wanted to check where the nurse's office is.
Since I'll probably be visiting it.
I see.
Show us the way, Big Sister.
Okay.
Leave it to your big sister.
Where is the nurse's office?
Nurse's Office
I've never gone before, so I don't know.
Hey now.
You've been here two years, and you
don't know where the nurse's office is?
Well, doesn't that just mean I had a healthy two years?
No, you went there for your physicals.
Oh, yeah.
I don't think I've ever been to the art room.
If you choose music for your fine
art, you won't have a chance to go.
I myself have never stepped foot in the judo hall.
I didn't even know we had a tea room until recently.
Even after going to the same school for three years, huh?
I guess everybody only goes to the places they need to.
I rarely go to the study room.
I go there!
Unexpected.
The silence...
It's perfect for sleeping.
Really...
Oh...
Yu-chan went to find the nurse's office
with the girl who helped her during exams.
They ended up in the same class.
It's a miracle.
When you stop and think about it...
...the fact that I met and became friends
with Kona-chan and Yuki-chan at this school...
...might be a miracle!
Pretty much.
We can only be here together for one more year.
But Kagami was the only one in a different class the whole time.
Don't mention that.
The correct answer is B. hemlock.
It'll be on the test, so keep that in mind.
Hey.
Wake up, Izumi!
Potemkin!
What were you dreaming about?
Sorry.
I'm actually concentrating really hard on not falling asleep.
But Teacher...
They still come!
Those demons of sleep...
With no warning!
No way to defend!
A full-out attack!
Not sure why you're trying to explain yourself...
Maybe this will help you stay awake.
Miyuki-san, you don't fall asleep in class, right?
Is there some kind of trick?
I wouldn't call it a trick...
But I really need my sleep...
...so I go to bed at eleven.
By the way...
...I went to bed at ten during our second year.
No good.
No chance.
Can't copy that!
I remember that this stuff was important, so I took notes...
...but I was asleep half the time, so I have no idea what I wrote.
I can't tell.
But just looking at this makes me feel good about myself.
This is proof that I tried to study.
But what did I write down...
Aren't those formulas?
Ms. Kuroi.
Wow!
You can understand this abomination!
Pretty much.
But that means you weren't dreaming about world history.
Okay.
Big Sister, you're still up?
Guess it stinks.
Oops.
It's already this late?
Maybe somebody's on.
You never learn, huh?
Can't wait for tomorrow.
Good lucky!
This is Lucky Channel, broadcasting to the whole wide world!
I'm your navigator, Akira Pretty Kogami!
And I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
We've already reached the 15th episode of Lucky Channel.
Huh?
This is the 15th episode?
Yes...
Then isn't this your last one?
Uh...
See ya.
Didn't you hear?
The producers told me that...
...starting with episode 16, the show
would feature Akira Kogami alone...
...so good luck.
Uh, that's...
Hey!
Gotcha!
April Fools'!
Oh...
That's what it was...
That's right...
See ya, sucker.
Anyway, you were pretty pumped.
During the Jam of Haruhi...
Nyoron!
...the MC was someone who looked like you.
Really?
Couldn't be...
So when am I going to get a concert?
No idea...
They better tell me early...
...since my schedule's filled up for the near future.
I'll go check right away!
Hurry.
Look!
Hurry
The East is...
Hurry it up...
...is burning red!
Hurry... it... up...
Circle.
Circle?
Producer says okay.
Next time?
Understood!
Next week during this time...
...we'll have a live concert featuring Akira Kogami!
N-Next week?!
F-F-For real?!
They secured a stage?
Yes.
He pulled some strings to get it done.
And bend.
Awesome!
Alright!
Not bad, Itou!
Man...
I can't wait to hear you sing.
No way!
Seriously?
For real?!
Leave the MC duties to me.
So you do know what you're doing.
Believe it or not, I'm well-known for my abilities as an MC.
I'm going all out!
There you have it, everyone!
Let's go crazy next week!
Then we'll see you next week!
Bye-bee!
Oh, yes.
Will Minoru Shiraishi really be back next week?
I'm a lieutenant.
Hey.
Now please listen to me.
What are you going to sing first?
You're not starting with Sunny Sunshiny, right?
The Love Legend of Minoru.
One, two, three, four!
The first song isn't Sunny Sunshiny, right?
Mi-Mi-Miracle! Minorun-run!
Oh, he already started.
Mi-Mi-Miracle...
What?
Sunny Sunshiny!
Huge audience, huh?
What are you singing first?
Uh, well...
How about I start with the Love Legend of Minoru.
For now.
Anyway, in that case...
Whenever you're ready.
What?
Whenever you're ready.
Now please listen to me.
The Love Legend of Minoru.
One, two, three, four!
Mi-Mi-Miracle! Minorun-run! Mi-Mi-Miracle! Minorun-run!

Good morning, Kagami.
Yo.
You're in a good mood.
What happened?
I got a new cell phone.
Finally, huh?
Seriously?
Then you can use songs for ringtones and set screensavers.
You're actually like a kid.
Wait a sec.
Do you watch anime and stuff then?
I already switched to one of my favorites.
Mi-Mi-Miracle! Mikurun-run! Mi-Mi-Miracle! Mikurun-run!
That's some song.
But you know...
You have to pick up before it gets to the chorus...
...which makes you stress out and regret it, right?
And if you don't pick up, they'll hang up anyway.
I don't really care about that stuff...
Is that how it is?
Ring
If I had to choose, I'd say Kagami's...
...an orc!
Why?!
I'm the only one who's a monster?!
Yes, hello?
This is Hiiragi.
Yeah...
Too used to answering the phone at home.
She was all mad at me a second ago...
I got a sandwich with balsamic vinegar sauce today...
How come women can switch moods so quickly?
But the other day, my mother...
I'm home!
Yes?
Hello?
Miyuki?
Geez!
Miyuki!
Here, phone!
From Konata-chan!
Um...
Did I do something wrong?
No.
My mother is really bad at deception...
...so you can tell when she's mad.
I believe she just hit her leg against the table.
But that wasn't exactly an issue of deception...
She's exactly the way she seems.
It's a good thing Miyuki knows so much.
I can ask you about anything I don't know.
I enjoyed being praised by Mother...
...so I became accustomed to looking things up.
Miyuki knows more than Mama does.
Now, I enjoy learning as well.
So in other words...
...I did a wonderful job of raising you, right?
That's how the conversation went.
That's some silly conversation.
In any case, I now know that you're
undeniably your mother's daughter.
Are we similar?
Down to the very last gene.
But...
Miyuki isn't just good at studying...
She knows a lot about all kinds of stuff.
There are many sources of information these days...
...and it's fun to learn a lot.
I couldn't do it.
No motivation!
Wanna play!
Rely on others in a pinch!
They say that only children and oldest children tend to be selfish...
That's right.
Aren't you an only child?
I guess it depends on the person.
Not at all.
You could say that I had a model...
...or someone who was like an oldest child...
...in my life.
I don't feel like cleaning!
Laundry is tiring!
Can we order out?
In our family...
...we have two older sisters...
...and meals turn into battles...
...which helps build character.
Yay!
Sukiyaki!
Eat up.
Let's eat!
And then, Kona-chan...
Oof.
...said that cell phones go out of service because
of a thick concentration of these something particles.
Mine.
Really...
And when her battery runs out...
...she says her phone's out of commission.
This one.
Modern girls use some strange words.
Hey.
Leave enough for Tsukasa.
Tsukasa.
You can have mine.
Thanks.
You sound nice...
...but weren't you stuffing yourself?
So having a lot of siblings can be good and bad.
You can say that about being an only child as well.
That's right.
Miyuki-chan spaces out sometimes.
Space out, is it?
You know...
Like the other day...
I can never get sick of the name elegant sea urchin.
What happened?
I was walking and thinking...
...and I ended up running into the door.
You have incredible concentration, Miyuki-san.
That happens a lot, huh?
Not often, though it's embarrassing.
Huh?
Doesn't it mean you have no
concentration if you start thinking about something...
...while you're doing something else?
Huh?
Which way is it?
That sounds like something Miyuki would do.
Indeed.
The other day, I was warming a drink...
I forgot.
I'll have to reheat it.
Many minutes later—
One more time...
And again...
Geez, Miyuki...
You forgot again, didn't you?
Sorry, it just happens.
You're so hopeless.
I'll bring it to you.
Thank you so much.
Click.
Many minutes later—
I forgot.
Like mother, like daughter.
Though it's embarrassing.
When did you start wearing glasses, Miyuki-san?
Midway through grade school, I believe.
So you weren't born nearsighted.
When I was little...
...I loved how my mother would read to me before I went to sleep....
...but my mother would fall asleep first...
...and I would want to know what happened...
...so I would read by myself in the dark room...
...and eventually, my eyes...
But it's best when you're close with your parents like that.
The reason kids these days tend to be cold and apathetic...
...may be a lack of...
...parental love or intimacy.
That's right...
I wonder when the last time Mom gave me a big hug was.
You're clingy...
...so you were really close to Mom until middle school.
Really?
That might be why you're such a good girl.
My dad is still clingy about me.
That might be why you haven't grown up, in a manner of speaking.
Speaking of kids...
...there sure have been a lot cases of kidnapping and confinement.
You seem to be sensitive to that stuff.
Well, first, I'm worried about my dad.
Don't just blurt out scary things.
Well, it more or less has to do with the games I play.
I wish they'd stop since it creates problems for other users.
At the very least...
...this stuff doesn't happen in the games I play.
Oh, yeah.
It's almost been a year.
Since what?
Since I started working.
My coworkers...
...said they're going to do something to celebrate.
That's right.
We've never gone before.
Maybe we'll check out the place you work some time.
As payback for New Year's.
Sure.
It's okay?!
Don't people usually hate that?
Well, half my job is to let other people look at me.
It's called a cosplay café, right?
Let me know before you come.
It can be pretty crowded at times.
We'll do that.
Hey, you guys.
Class started.
Hello?
We just left the station.
Yeah, yeah.
We'll buy it for you.
Okay. Okay!
Did Kona-chan say it was okay?
It's okay...
...but she wants us to go over there and buy this month's Comp...
...and the Lelou** comic for her.
I wonder if we can find it quickly.
She said to remember to ask the clerk to stamp the receipt...
Sounds complicated.
Excuse me.
Do you have a minute?
Can I take a picture?
I'm not Kamigishi.
I'm Hiiragi.
Hey!
What are you doing?!
Could I also get a picture?
Sheesh!
Stop that!
Excuse me then.
Could you say Hiroyuki-chan?
Hi-Hiroyuki...
...-chan?
We're leaving.
This is the first time I've been in one of these places.
It's so big that I'm quite nervous.
She said on the phone that we'd see it once we got there.
Kona-chan would know.
I'd get lost if I were alone.
Is this it?
Now we just need the Lelou** comic.
Not here.
I can't find it.
Excuse me.
Where would I find the Lelou** comic?
That would be this.
Code Ge**s.
You could at least have told us the title...
Can I put this on a point card next time?
Then you'll have to bring this receipt with you.
Okay.
Thank you very much!
Now we just have to go find Konata.
I'm hungry, Sis!
I'm almost done working.
Hold on a bit.
How are we supposed to find our way?
Here
Gamers
I looked it up just in case.
I believe it's this way.
That's our Yuki-chan!
Guess we can only count on Miyuki.
This is the place, right?
Yes.
On the third floor.
Welcome back, Master!
You can have a seat here.
The first hour is 800 yen.
All the soda you can drink.
All the games you can play for free.
All the sweets you can eat.
Can I get this broiled eel?
Currently not available.
Then the shrimp pilaf...
Currently impossible.
Then spaghetti with meat sauce.
It will take fifteen minutes.
Permission?
Okay.
Do it.
They can do business like that?
You people.
What do you want to drink?
H-Hold on a sec!
Hurry it up.
There's a penalty if you take too long! A penalty!
Is this how you should treat a customer?
It's how we do things here.
You're done deciding, right?
I'll have a melon soda.
I have no interest in an ordinary menu.
I'll have milk tea.
What do you want?
I'm looking!
A brigade member shouldn't be this slow!
When did I become a brigade member?
That's the setting in this place.
You're a hundred years too early to be defying the chief.
What a pain...
Then give me an ice coffee.
Order from the chief!
Wait here!
Oh, boy...
Hasn't stunk in a while...
We're going on stage now, so watch.
If we can solve all the mysteries on this planet...
...we can all go anywhere we want!
Even to the end of time!
Boooon!!
Encore! Encore!
Amazing!
They're all very talented.
Ponytail version next!
Ponytail version, please!
She's an exchange student.
A first-year at our school.
My name is Patricia Martin.
Nice to meet you.
We've even put out a CD.
[Konata and Patty]
Here.
[Konata and Patty]
[Konata and Patty]
[Cos it! Oh My Honey]
[Konata and Patty]
[Cos it! Oh My Honey]
[Konata and Patty]
[Cos it! Oh My Honey]
Should you really release something like that?
Excuse me.
Could I get some tea?
Do you want warm tea?
Yes.
Hot tea please.
I'd like a melon soda, please.
Got it.
Uh...
What's this Up-To-Us Mixed Juicy Juice like?
Classified information.
House rules!
This café really exhausts me.
M-My height...
Don't worry.
I'm sure you'll grow in time.
Th-That's right.
Big Sister!
Yu-chan.
And here's a person to crush my hopes...
H-How much taller have you grown since you entered high school?
Man...
I haven't grown in either direction.
You'd better prepare yourself.
No need to fret.
You're still in demand.
Hey, you two.
Have you ever been to a class reunion?
Not yet.
Me neither.
But where did that come from?
Isn't the phrase "you haven't
changed" usually supposed to be a compliment?
But the only people who want to hear
that have probably changed considerably...
...in various places...
So it does concern you.
Okay!
Golden Week's starting...
...but listen up.
You've also got tests right after break...
...but don't forget that you're preparing for exams...
...and use your vacation wisely.
Also...
...you still have a few days left of school before break.
I won't let you take any sick days.
Kamchatka!
The aura emitting from her whole body...
No question about it.
She's Legendary Girl A.
Is today's target that new book?
Or is she after some goods?
Use your head!
Don't forget that we're having a spring audio/visual special!
Not yet!
Give her enough room.
Recommend an item once she's let her guard down.
That's right!
Slowly wait to approach her.
That's it!
Now!
Approach her!
Heading out!
Welcome!
We have these new releases!
Mi-Mi-Miracle!
Kagami?
You made it?
Be right there.
Just killing time while waiting for someone?!
When you're boiling something...
...you use rough cutting...
...and cut them into random shapes.
My...
Really...
That increases the total surface area...
...and lets the taste soak in.
Once you've scooped out the Iye...
...you let it cook on medium for around ten minutes.
It'll become soggy if it sits too long...
...so take it out once you can poke through.
I see.
Somehow, when it's home economics...
...Miyuki starts looking below average.
Now I know how you see us.
Hiiragi-chan.
Want to study for the test together in the library?
Sounds good.
Club activities are on hiatus right before a test...
...so there's nothing to do.
That's why you study.
That's the point.
Well...
I know that...
But when my club time is suddenly free...
...it's like a whole new world is open to me.
When you look at it that way, I can't waste the time on studying.
It gets me all excited.
Anyway, you should realize you're
half the reason for this study session.
Pooped!
That was fast!
Let's take a break!
Maybe you can't concentrate because you have no goal?
Don't you have any dreams for the future?
Dreams?
Not really for the future...
But this time of year, don't you wish you could win the lottery...
...and live the simple life?
Everything's a drag.
Minegishi.
Do something about her.
When I use my head...
...I need sweet stuff!
Once we're done, I'll give you some cookies I baked last time.
Hang in there.
So you bake sweets and stuff.
Can't compare with that Ajiyoshi boy.
Nah, you've got that Ajiyoshi boy licked.
Studying's a pain!
Sis.
I tried making a madeleine.
What's wrong?
Oh, yeah...
I wouldn't lump you with them...
...but I was just thinking that you tend to make similar friends.
Haven't you been overly relaxed...
...because you thought it was only stomatitis?
There sure are a lot more medical programs like this these days.
That's true.
It's scary since it could really happen.
Especially for me.
Actually, after watching this...
...I start feeling like my time's almost come.
Too many possible causes.
Please stop the depressing talk.
I beg you!
Live!
Sis!
Teach me this part.
Um...
Curses, like chickens, come home to roost?
This means...
...that Kazu likes chicken.
When you go home, you'll find roast chicken...
...I think?
Sis.
Translate the next part.
Let's see.
When you make the contract...
Did we ever learn this?
That's right.
This one time when I was working as a shrine maiden...
...a foreigner told me about why the gate is called a torii.
What'd he say?
In the past, people believed that birds would carry the dead...
...so they named it tori (bird) i (here)
because it was a place for birds to rest.
They know way more about Japan than we do.
It might have been faster to ask Kagami...
The freezing Sea of Japan...
Where have my loved ones gone?

Hey!
How is this a concert?
This is the best we could do on our budget!
Don't think you'll get away with this!
It's starting!
Who do you think I...
Would you mind if I talked to myself?
I softly whispered to the seagulls.
Woman, led by a sincere heart...
Frozen by the northern sea winds...
Gone astray...
Love falls apart...
Drinks are taking a while.
Resentment crumbles...
Yes.
I've brought your drinks.

I want to release a song by myself, too.

Yo!
Sis!
How'd the test go?
Same as always...
Another disaster.
We have more free time during testing...
...but you end up following your usual schedule...
...so you have to cram the night before, right?
You should act more like someone applying for college...
Under
the
Sun
Thousands of manga and games were confiscated from the suspect's room.
Based on his methods, it is believed that other crimes can be attributed to him.
Another story about this...
Incredible...
There was another person like you on the news.
Every time this happens, it makes me think how it isn't fair.
They always use these kinds of manga as examples.
There are good manga out there.
They just never get mentioned.
R-Right...
I feel kinda bad.
You're a good person!
Usually, people just make fun of me for being a helpless otaku.
Looking at the people I know...
...sisters tend to absorb characteristics from one another.
Like you and Cousin Yui...
Or Kagami and Tsukasa...
I was talking about that with Big Sister this morning.
You're really close to Miyuki-chan.
You're as close as sisters.
I see.
It was absorption?
Kona-chan!
Happy birthday!
I would have forgotten if Tsukasa hadn't mentioned it.
Congratulations.
Thanks, everyone!
It makes me happy when people celebrate my birthday...
...but at this age, I really can't be happy about getting older.
Nah.
It makes me super happy.
Why?
Do you want to get a driver's license?
Because I can play adult games now.
Haven't you been openly playing them the whole time?
Of course not...
You've grown older...
...without aging mentally or physically.
Let me go!
Miyuki probably gets mistaken for someone older.
'Cause Yuki-chan looks like an adult.
When I go out in my normal clothes...
...I occassionally get mistaken for an office lady.
So they skip straight past college.
In your case...
...if you walk around in normal clothes...
...they'll think you're in grade school.
Say what you want.
Starting today, I'm an adult!
What are you talking about?
Besides...
...if you're an adult now...
...shouldn't you be less passionate about anime and manga?
Y-You still need to have a child-like
heart filled with passion and dreams!
Make up your mind...
This?
While Big Sister's at work...
...we're going to secretly prepare a birthday party for her.
Sorry I'm late!
Okay!
Let's get everything ready.
Yes!
Happy Birthday
Big Sister
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
And here's a call from Konata.
Wonder if she'll be coming home soon.
Konata?
Sorry!
Forgot to tell you...
...but my coworkers are throwing a party for me...
...so I won't be eating dinner at home.
And I'll be coming home late.
Yutaka.
Doesn't this taste great?
We worked hard.
Yui-chan.
You can take that off now.
Future aspirations, huh...
I have dreams and stuff...
...but it's kind of hard when you stop and think about it.
That's right.
The major you decide on...
...will have an effect on your career.
First is nutritional science.
Second is fashion design.
Third is marketing.
Since I like cooking and sewing.
So you wrote down your dreams.
And what about you, Miyuki-san?
I want to be a doctor...
...so while I didn't write down colleges...
...I put medical schools for all three choices.
That's our Miyuki-san.
You have a clear goal.
What about you, Kagami?
Me?
My first choice is law.
My second choice is economics.
My third choice is literature.
Sheesh.
Too boring.
Is that a bad thing?
What about you?
First Choice
Brigade Chief
Second Choice
Nanto Shinken Master
Third Choice
Storyboarder
Here we go.
Some people try to turn it into a joke.
Actually...
...do you have any talents besides making faces?
Talents...
I can name every Poke**n!
Th-That's definitely amazing.
But it has nothing to do with your future.
Here it is!
I'll go pay for this.
When you buy magazines and manga...
...you always take one from the bottom.
Everybody's already touched the ones on top.
I'd rather buy a clean one.
I know what you mean.
Like when I go to a sushi-go-round...
...I order straight from the chef...
...instead of taking them off the belt.
You know...
Most of the ones on the belt are already dry.
You do that?
What a bad customer.
No way!
You don't?
What a scrooge.
I've been wondering...
How can you stand reading books that are all text?
Don't you get sleepy?
But this is a light novel.
It basically feels like reading manga.
Sure about that...
There are plenty of insert pictures...
...and the writing is simple.
Why don't you give it a try?
W-Well, you know...
They already made an anime of it.
So I'll just watch that.
If it were a manga...
...you'd be talking about how the original has its own merits...
...and check both out.
Just read it already.
I must respectfully pass.
But you know...
You read lots of stuff besides light novels.
How should I put it...
When I become more culturally refined...
...my soul becomes richer.
Well, it's like food for the soul.
I see.
What is it?
By that reasoning...
...the snacks are for making your body richer.
Shut up!
Aren't there also light novels...
...serialized in the magazines you read?
Not just comics.
I look at the pictures...
So despite everything you say...
...your love is pretty weak.
You skim, huh?
Fine!
Be that way.
I'll read it!
Hey, it's okay.
No need to push yourself.
I only skim 'cause I have lots of other stuff to read!
Fine by me.
I didn't say a thing.
Oops!
I forgot my world history textbook.
I left it on my desk after studying.
Konata.
Lend me your world history textbook.
You didn't take it home, right?
Okay.
Did you forget yours?
That's unusual.
Here.
Hiiragi.
This is one fun textbook.
No, this is...
Not getting anywhere...
Guess I'll find something to drink.
Sheesh.
Huh?
Thought there was some leftover from last time...
Gives me a chance to get some fresh air.
They're closed!
This is some kind of challenge, isn't it?
Your total comes to 320 yen.
Huh?
What's wrong, Sis?
Yeah...
When you're in a bad mood...
...you make a bunch of little mistakes...
...which just makes your mood worse, right?
I know what you mean!
You can't seem to do anything right.
Like a negative spiral?
That's right!
I baked a cake.
Want some?
Yay!
Studying is rough...
...so you have to take breaks now and then.
That's it!
I'll bake cookies tomorrow!
That'll relieve stress.
I'm counting on you!
Afterwards...
Now I've got a new source of stress.
Right?
Don't you agree, Iwasaki-san?
That's right.
Those two are so busy that they keep missing each other.
I know what you mean.
That's right.
Big Sister is applying for college...
...so I shouldn't disturb her studying!
Sorry...
I'm going to talk softer.
Yu-chan.
Let's play a game after you're off the phone.
Get your game on!
Say what?!
Guess this is the last year I'll be wearing this uniform.
That gets me thinking...
There's something inside.
My favorite handkerchief that I thought I had lost...
It was in my summer uniform's pocket, huh?
Didn't we have some wasabi octopus?
What is this?
What was this?!
It's changed so much I can't tell...
It sure rains a lot in the rainy season.
Sure does.
It starts getting really hot...
...and then we switch to our summer uniform just in time...
...but the temperature can suddenly drop, which sucks.
You guys are still here?
You're lucky since you can change your clothes whenever you want.
What are you talking about?
It's so much easier when you don't have
to think about what to wear every morning.
You're really wack, Teacher.
Ya-ho!
It's the rainy season!
So humid!
Sis.
Cousin Yui.
It sucks how it's always raining.
Do you want some tea?
Please.
On a happier note...
...it's almost been a year since you got married, right?
That's right.
Time sure flies.
The image of a raining sky...
Is like the image of Cousin Yui's heart when her husband
is away on business with their first anniversary coming up...
Her heart is...
Sorry...
That was my fault.
It's okay.
I'm used to this kind of pain.
Here.
Have something warm to drink.
But I'm still depressed...
It's delicious.
That's a relief.
Sheesh.
At this rate, my love's going to rust eventually!
If you took it to an auto repair place...
...it'd probably be good as new after 45 minutes.
You could at least comfort me...
Sorry.
Force of habit.
Hello?
So you can come home!
Didn't even take 45 minutes.
It was like an instant.
That's right.
You haven't gotten your clothes back from Matsuri?
That's bad.
If you don't ask for them back soon...
...she'll say they're hers.
That would be bad!
I really like those!
I envy Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san...
...for having two sisters.
Pretty much.
Really?
In my opinion...
...I'd rather be an only child like you two.
Right?
I get that feeling sometimes...
But you know...
...you can do so much more with a bigger cast.
Like the story set in olden America...
...of a mother and her four daughters...
...waiting for the father to return.
Or an enigmatic band of female thieves who target art.
One, two.
Huh?
One too many.
Seriously...
She turns every conversation into
something about anime or games.
Hey, Kagami.
Did you buy the stuff for dinner?
Did you forget to tell her, Tsukasa?
Sorry...
What? What?
What's going on?
Geez. Did you forget?
Mom and Dad are out tonight.
Their trip was today?
So then...
...we were supposed to buy groceries for dinner.
I completely forgot.
I called Kagami's cell...
...and left a message.
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
You have 1 message
Matsuri.
Just use what's in the fridge.
I finally get a chance to cook...
Just let it go this time.
Sheesh.
This is all your fault!
Sorry...
Fine.
I'll go now.
Geez...
You just had to go and say that.
But...
And does she even know what to buy?
Geez, man...
She doesn't even like to cook that much.
Why's she so worked up?
Sis!
Tsukasa.
Sis...
You don't have the shopping list, right?
They're late...
If you're gonna worry...
...you should have gone yourself.
You're late.
What's wrong?
Matsuri was really worried.
The usual store was out of saffron.
I said that curry powder would work...
...but Sis insisted that we find some, so
we went to the supermarket farther away.
Geez.
You didn't have to do that.
So sorry.
Come on.
Let's make dinner.
Whew, I'm starving.
Here.
Sorry for the wait.
That just leaves Matsuri's masterpiece.
I'm done!
It looks great!
Looks like it was cooked just right.
Hey, Matsuri.
When did you learn how to cook this?
I went to this one restaurant with
some college friends a while back..
...and this was on the menu.
It was so good...
...that I wanted to let you all try it...
...so I asked for the recipe.
I'm surprised they gave it to you.
Anyway, chow down.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Listen to this.
Your father got the date wrong.
What do you mean?
The reservation was apparently for next week.
Straight out of a comedy...
Dinner now?
You haven't eaten?
Paella, is it?
Matsuri made it!
Oh.
That's amazing!
But Kagami bought the ingredients for it.
She went all the way to the farther supermarket.
Then I'll help myself.
Good idea.
This is pretty good.
Who took the mussel?
Mussel?
Was I not supposed to?
Unbelievable!
I was saving that for last!
Then write your name on it.
Geez. Stop fighting.
Yo.
I'll hang out with you after school today.
Do you need to buy something?
Shin** Yamada's new book.
Though, we have a bunch of homework lately...
...so I don't really have time to read.
I also have a pile of unread manga by my pillow.
But I end up going for a new one.
I kinda know what you mean!
Finish your old stuff before you buy new ones.
Well...
It's reassuring if I buy it first.
Or I end up feeling unsatisfied otherwise.
Right?
Don't look at me.
Good lucky!
Okay!
Let's have a blast today!
We're already on the seventeenth episode of Lucky Channel.
Okay!
Your navigator...
Red roses have thorns!
The platypus of the idol world!
Akira Kogami!
And...
Hello!
...we've invited a really big guest today!
How long are you going to make me wait?!
Crap.
He really did come back.
Sorry, sorry.
Here he is...
Um...
Today's guest...
Special Guest
Meito Anizawa-san
...is the Anime Manager:
Meito Anizawa-san.
Okay!
This program is too weak!
But...
Um...
Lucky Star is a slow and relaxed anime...
...about completely ordinary high school students.
Which is why...
...Lucky Channel should be considered...
...slow rather than...
That won't work!
Where'd he go?!
Fast!
Listen.
Do you know what the three factors
for determining an anime's success are?
The three factors?
Um...
Voice actors, animation, and script?
Wrong!
My back is burning red!
The answer is...
The answer is?
The staff and cast's love for the show!
And time!
And production cost!
Well, those factors are all out of our control...
Understand?
It doesn't matter how good the original work was!
There's no point if the script is bad!
It doesn't matter how hard the voice actors work!
It won't work out if the characters aren't in color!
Just look at Shiraishi.
N-Now I'm white(shiroi)!
Each respective part requires its resources!
You have to put your all into the work!
Love and passion are what...
...truly create a beautiful piece of work!
Is that how it works?
You.
You're currently Akira Kogami-san, correct?
Currently?
I've always been Akira.
When you were Rou**n!
Gao**nger!
**tato!
Mai**i!
Didn't you have love?!
What are you talking about?
If you still have regrets...
Nope. None.
...you should burn yourself out as Akira Kogami!
Like I was saying...
Okay!
I will burn myself out as Minoru Shiraishi!
Well said, Shiraishi!
Okay, first of all.
How to work a live event!
Over?
You were MC at an event recently, right?
Bye-bee...
You were watching?
Of course! It's my job!
Good work, everyone!
It was a huge job.
I'm leaving now...
My nerves were a wreck the whole time.
You still have a lot to learn!
Shiraishi can handle the rest.
First, your ad libs are weak!
Yes!
You shouldn't be losing to Sugita—
Minoru
Shiraishi
Theater
Ma'am!
Are you unsatisfied with your husband?
Hello. Minoru Shiraishi here.
Now, please listen to me!
Sweet sunshine!
Looks peachy, doesn't it?
Hey!

Hey, Kagami.
Do you like chocolate wafers?
I do...
Really.
Then here.
Enjoy!
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot!
I have more!
I have even more, so help yourself!
Wait a sec.
Why do you have so much?
Well, you know those toys that come with snacks.
I can never seem to get the one I want...
...so I end up buying a whole bunch.
Yeah...
Some people just want the toys and ignore the snacks.
To
Each
Her
Own
Fox.
Um...
Squirrel.
Dog.
What are you babbling about?
Oh.
Just wondering what kind of animals everybody might be.
I like to play tricks, so I'd be a fox.
Based on her image, Tsukasa would be a dog.
Yu-chan's like a small animal, so she'd be a squirrel.
I see.
So you probably want to say that I'm a tiger or wolf or something.
Nah.
You get lonely really easily, so you'd probably be a bunny.
Plus, your pigtails look like bunny ears.
That kinda feels embarrassing...
...so stop.
This is fun!
Me?
A bunny?
What about everyone else?
Cousin Yui is hyperactive, so maybe a leopard.
Iwasaki-san is all cool and suave, so maybe a hawk.
Yuki-chan has that whole white feel...
...and then she just shouts fluffy for some reason...
...so probably a sheep.
Fumoffu.
Nah...
Miyuki-san has to be a cow!
Around there...
That's what an old man would say...
We were at Konata's place yesterday...
...and saw some of her writing from grade school.
My...
Is that so?
But you know...
Konata may look like a sloppy person...
...but she actually saved that stuff.
Dad told me to keep that stuff safe.
But the real surprise...
...was the list of her dreams for the future.
Veterinarian and lawyer...
Regular jobs like those.
Really.
Well...
The way her dream changed
every year was definitely Konata-esque.
When you look at those...
...you can tell what kind of games and manga I liked at the time.
I get it.
That's what it was.
Back to that again.
Then again, some people put down bride for their ideal job.
That's not even a job.
That's cute!
No.
And like, Tsukasa...
I'm talking about you.
R-Really?
This is why airheads are hopeless.
Airheads tend to not realize they're airheads.
It's not an issue of being an airhead!
That may be true.
Just so you know...
That includes you, Miyuki-san...
Is something the matter?
Miyuki-san.
How bad is your eyesight without glasses?
Under 20/200.
Really...
I heard somewhere that eating blueberries is good for your eyes.
Indeed.
There are also carrots, which contain vitamin A.
Green-yellow vegetables such as spinach.
Pork, which contains vitamin B.
And items containing protein such as sesame seeds and liver...
...are said to be good for your eyes.
Also, laser surgery is the subject of much attention.
But I'm not brave enough to try it.
And I've seen shows about eyesight training on TV.
You know a lot.
Well, I've only named a few of the many options.
But why hasn't your eyesight gotten better if you know so much?
I haven't actually used any of the methods I know.
Why not?
Well...
I wonder why...
You should give it a try!
Like that eyesight training thing.
Right now?
Well...
First, you close your eyes.
And open them really quickly!
Then you look left, right...
...up, and down...
...without moving your head.
Miyuki-san!
Your head!
Your head is moving!
Wh-Wha—
Huh?
H-Huh?
Th-That's strange...
You can stop now...
I may have ended up exhausting my eyes...
Won't that make your eyesight even worse?
Hey, Kona-chan.
What's moe?
When you put it that way...
It's definitely used to express that you like something...
...but I don't really know the specifics.
What?
So you use it without knowing the meaning?
I'll just say that anyone who
understands the general meaning is hardcore.
Not that it really matters...
...but I kinda understand.
We've got dogs from all around the world!
Okay!
Puppies are so cute!
Dad.
Let's get a dog!
Hey, Tsukasa.
That's easy to say...
...but can you train it, walk it, feed it...
...and take care of all the other things?
And puppies and adult dogs look pretty different.
Are you prepared to care for a living being instead of an object?
Y-You're right...
I need to think it through...
B-But you sure know a lot about it, Sis.
That's 'cause, yeah...
I'm also pretty simple...
So I went and looked stuff up.
Look, Konata!
You like this artist, right?
Read it.
Fine.
You're such a pain.
Your face is really close.
Stare~
Stare~
Stare~

Um...
Do you need something?
I was wondering how far you'd gotten.
Did that Osano person already show up?
No.
That's still beyond my limits.
Come on.
Read faster.
There sure are a lot of elections this year.
It's killing me.
Really?
What's with the gloomy faces?
Students should go home and study.
Teacher.
We were talking about how there have been too many elections.
Where did that come from?
Election coverage messes up the
schedule for regular programming!
The first airing of this one show was late by four hours!
And then they have updates in the middle of the program!
And the L-shaped ticker just makes the screen smaller!
But you know...
Election coverage is educational in terms of current events...
You shouldn't keep going on about anime.
Besides, air times change even without elections.
Stuff like K-1...
...pushes back the regular programming.
Don't you like martial arts?
Konata
I have experience, but I'm not that interested!
Even anime has special programs sometimes, right—?
Nanako
My honey—!
Konata
But they don't run overtime and create problems for the following show, so it's okay!
Nanako
Bah, a college applicant should worry less about that
and study—!!
Nanako
Konata
Gotta finish with a power attack—
Sorry for the wait.
Kona-chan doesn't have an umbrella.
You could at least check the weather forecast.
Maybe I should be like guys and just not care and go home.
But I wonder why boys don't mind getting wet.
Because they don't have to worry about bras showing through.
I get it.
It makes sense...
...but don't just blurt it out loud.
Don't you have any shame?
So...
One of you lend me an umbrella.
Well...
We go home together...
...so I guess we can make do with one.
Thanks so much.
You don't leave an umbrella at school?
But you leave all your textbooks here.
Well...
I had one here...
But I used it once, and I haven't remembered to bring it back.
It's not a daily routine or anything.
So you only remember if you've made a habit of it.
Hey, Suzume!
Wait up!
Oh, yeah.
When you wear a raincoat and galoshes...
...you look pretty lame.
That's true.
It makes you look like a kid.
So why is it so attractive in art?
Like I would know.
Yo, Konata!
Good morning!
Er...
What's wrong, Tsukasa?
I got in trouble 'cause my cell phone bill was too high!
I rarely use my phone, so I only
have to pay the monthly access charge.
Monthly Access Charge
Really...
Economical, isn't it?
So you say...
...but if you barely use it...
...the monthly access charge is already a waste.
Don't sweat the small stuff, Kagami.
I got a message.
Please buy eggs on the way home.
Understood.
I'll go buy some...
...on the way home...
...with Sis.
Hey.
You're talking with your parents, right?
Doesn't it end up more polite when you're using text messaging?
Well, I pretty much know what you mean.
It'll change once you get used to it.
How long have you used this?
Maybe a year.
How long before you usually replace it?
Isn't two years about right?
That's around when the battery starts dying.
I'm going to double...
No, triple that time!
Just you watch!
I don't get the point.
I take good care of my possessions.
I make them last.
You're not even using it.
Yeah...
Some people splurge on their hobbies...
...but pinch on everything else.
Sorry, Sis.
Can I borrow your world history textbook?
Again?
Geez, you're hopeless...
Here.
Be more careful next time.
I'll return it later.
Your sister's pretty careless.
She sure is.
That's why I have to be the responsible one.
But maybe it's that...
She has somebody to rely on...
...so she lets loose.
In other words, your existence allows her to be that way!
That sounds really convincing...
Hiiragi.
What time is it?
There's an alarm clock right in front of you.
There is.
A-A victim of Hiiragi's legendary morning violence!
Just to be clear...
It fell and broke.
Tsukasa.
You can read manga...
...but you should read the newspaper every once in a while.
It's good to know what's going on in the world.
Um...
Th-The newspaper's hard to read...
I can't tell where the next line starts.
Thought it might be something like that.
You there.
What is it?
Could you call Kobayakawa-san for me?
Tell her the third-year, Izumi, is here.
Y-Yes.
Kobayakawa!
A third-year, Izumi-senpai, is here!
What is it, Big Sister?
Man...
It's so fun how they're suddenly
polite when they realize you're older.
So cute.
I wish I could be tall like you, Iwasaki-san.
I wonder why there's such a big difference.
I can't say for sure...
...but it may be because I drink lots of milk.
I see!
So it's the result of your daily efforts!
No...
Life isn't so simple...
I was trying for growth of a different kind...
Since it's raining...
...we're gonna play dodgeball in the gym today.
You seem the type to be the last person standing, Iwasaki-san.
Since you look strong.
I actually end up being one of the
last ones left if I'm on the near side.
Maybe it's 'cause I'm hard to hit since I'm small.
They both survive...
I'm not even that good at dodgeball.
...but for very different reasons...
I'd kinda feel bad if I hit Kobayakawa-san.
But I don't really understand it myself.
That's too bad.
We're on different teams.
Looks like we're together.
Iwasaki-san looks like she's good at sports...
...and she won't hold back, so it's scary.
Head... Out of the question
Upper Body... A strong hit might make her feel sick
Lower Body.....She might fall and get hurt
But what if I let someone else do it—
But what if I let someone else do it—
I got placed on the outer side...
...so it's okay.
That's good to hear.
Iwasaki-san's really a nice person.
So Kobayakawa-san is attacking?
And Iwasaki-san is on the inner side?
So I'm recei—
Er...
I mean defending.
I was attacked by infirmary staff...
Are you okay?
You sure are amazing, Iwasaki-san.
You hit one target after another.
Really?
Your movement and reflexes are great.
Not particularly.
Oops...
Is she mad I made a big deal about it?
No.
She's embarrassed.
Really?
That makes me feel better...
But it's hard to tell...
I see...
So she's the type that's easily misunderstood.
So people who don't really know her...
...get a different impression...
Have you gone on any trips after you got here?
I went on a pilgrimage to all the sacred places.
Sacred places?
Yes.
I visited Japan's three most sacred places.
You mean like Kamakura, Kyoto, and Nara?
No.
Akiba in Tokyo.
Nipponbashi in Osaka.
And Osu in Nagoya!
And I also visited some sites around here.
You mean like Tokyo Tower and Asakusa?
That's wrong!
Nakano...
...and Kichijoji!
Um...
What's wrong?
I think some dust got in my eyes...
Are you okay?
Tell me if it gets to be too much to bear.
I'm okay.
Good situation, isn't it?!
No!
I shouldn't look at my friends with perverted eyes!
Hello!
Hey!
Come on in!
I'll go get drinks.
So many books...
This is all we have...
So Hiyorin once had such a phase...
Kill me now...
Really, just kill me...
And this would be now.
Oh, sh—
You can tell she's improved.
You're right.
She's really good!
This picture kinda resembles Iwasaki-san.
Takarazuka Revue, huh?
Huh?
Is that me?
Is this like a fairy tale?
Please let me see it when it's done.
No!
I shouldn't draw my friends in perverted ways!
Tamura-san.
Shall we go to Maiden Road?
That was the plan.
What's Maiden Road like?
You don't know?!
Neither do I.
Good grief.
Maiden Road, huh...
Maiden Road...
...is a street west of
Sunshine 60 in Ikebukuro, Tokyo.
Many stores sell manga,
anime, and character goods.
It's as popular as Akiba in
terms of attracting hardcore fans.
However, unlike Akiba...
...the customers
are mostly female...
...which is why it was
named Maiden Road.
In other words, it's a
gathering place for fujoshi.
Fujoshi?
Written as rotten girl...
Pronounced fujoshi.
They're rotten?!
Well...
That's one way to look at it...
Y-Y'know!
The three-second-rule! The three-second-rule!
If it's under five seconds...
...there won't be any bacteria!
What?
We didn't say anything.
My beloved meatball...
What happened to the three-second-rule?
Well...
Just let me say that it depends on the situation.
Good lucky!
Okay!
Let's have another blast today!
We've managed to make it to the
eighteenth episode of Lucky Channel!
Okay!
You all know who the navigator is by now!
Akira Kogami!
And...
Yes!
Akira-sama's assistant...
...working hard again today...
Minoru Shiraishi!
Well, today's theme...
...is the introduction for all of the new characters...
...who have joined the regular cast!
All of them!
Too many!
First, the addition to the Izumi family...
Konata-san's cousin.
Yutaka Kobayakawa-san.
And her classmates...
Minami Iwasaki-san.
Hiyori Tamura-san.
Patricia Martin-san.
In addition!
We have Kagami-san's classmates.
Misao Kusakabe-san...
...and Ayano Minegishi-san.
It's gotten rather lively!
As you may have already noticed...
It's blocking me.
...the new characters have been appearing in the opening...
Hey.
I said that it's blocking me!
How many more characters are they going to introduce?!
It went flying!
We're on the eighteenth episode!
What happened to my appearance?!
That's right, Akira-sama.
Didn't you just make an appearance?
That adorable image of you in a raincoat and galoshes.
Yeah.
What to say...
Last week...
...I was able to talk with our guest, Anizawa-san...
...and he told me that an actor needs initiative!
And presence!
Indeed.
Your appearance today...
...brief as it was...
...was screaming to me, "Akira Kogami is here—
You sound passionate.
Hey.
Yes?
Hey!
Ah, no.
It's nothing.
Oh, no!
It's time to say goodbye.
So there you have it.
We're waiting for you to send us any
questions or comments you have about the show!
Hey.
Who is it?
You can direct them to our home page or the radio show!
Then bye-bee!
Turn that thing off!
Then good work!
Was it a message?
No.
No, it wasn't!
Was it a message?
N-No way!
Of course not!
Who's it from?
Uh, it was from my parents.
About what?
Well, they wanted me to go visit...
What was your reply?
Uh, you know...
Say it.
Well, basically...
I've always been looking...
...for my partner in destiny.
I'm sure you're the one.
Though I've got no proof to show.
When I see your smile...
...this ordinary life...
...magically starts to shine.
Like you cast a spell on me.
You're the one who taught me...
...the joy and suffering of love.
No matter how long the road ahead may be...
...the two of us need not fear.
I'm so very happy...
...I could spend this special day with you.
I'll protect you for eternity...
...with everything I have...
I promise you...
Okay.
Kinda screwed up on the falsetto.
Sorry.
Sorry.
It was touching!
Touching!
Thanks.
Touching!
Thanks.
That's so old!

Reality
Patty.
Are you used to your job yet?
Yes!
Perfectly!
With Patty around...
...first-timers can probably have a fun time without being nervous.
No.
I don't handle first-timers.
Really?
I only serve people who've visited lots and paid lots!
It's store policy.
Th-That's pretty harsh...
Next time:
2D has Substance.
「2D has Substance」
Look forward to next time!

So, I have a pet dog in this game...
...and it's so cute that I start talking to it.
You know how...
...when you talk to animals...
...your voice gets all soft and affectionate?
Except this was in a game.
I know what you mean.
Lil' Goldy
When I talk to my goldfish...
...I lapse into baby talk.
I get talking to dogs and cats...
...but people who talk to fish must be pretty darn lonely.
What did you say?!
That's discrimination!
What's with the patronizing look?!
Oh, yeah.
I've been wondering for a while...
When people call hot dogs...
...wieners...
I wonder what that means.
U-Um...
It would take a long time if I went into detail...
...but it was definitely derived from a German word.
Okay.
Raise your hand if you just thought of something naughty.
2D
has
Substance
Observations
on Gu***m
Oh, yeah...
Gu***m is still ridiculously popular.
Your dad also ***** it.
There are all kinds of Gu***m.
Like V...
And W...
And X...
And I saw 'em all when they first aired!
You could call it passion...
...or my duty as a fan!
In that case...
...would you watch Gu*dam: The Serial Murder Case...
...or Detective Gunda* if they started airing?
As a Gu***m fan...
...I suppose that I have a **** to watch it.
**** is kinda...
But it's a ***** you can't call it by a letter.
All this talk about **ndam has reminded me...
Despite appearances, I'm already *** years older than *muro.
Time passed in a *****.
And in two more years...
...I'll be the same age as B****t-san.
Can't even imagine it!
Well, you know...
B****t-san is a pretty *** character, even in the Gu***m world.
Same goes for Ha**n-sama...
Actually...
You're ***** for your age...
...so I wouldn't use *** for a standard.
You could at least say that I look ***** for my age.
Nah.
You're so cute!
Our neighbor gave us something nice.
A souvenir from vacation, apparently.
What?
A pot?
You grew up to be my kind of girl!
Such a cutie.
It's hot, Dad.
And that was a dangerous statement.
Morning already, huh...
I got wasted last night...
...so I figured I'd be out till noon...
Guess I'm still young.
This is the morning news for Monday, July 2nd.
Early this morning, a man at a restaurant...
Huh?
What about Sunday?
What happened to my day off?!
...yelled, "Hey, this ramen sucks!"
I always plan on studying for tests at night...
...but I end up getting sleepy.
So I asked Sis for advice...
You don't like horror movies, right?
If you watched one...
...wouldn't that keep you up all night?
Seeing how you crawled into my bed last time.
And so...
...I didn't get sleepy after watching it.
An older sister knows just what to do.
But then...
...once it got dark...
Thump
...the slightest sound from behind would make me jump...
...which made it even harder to focus on studying.
And I ended up not getting enough sleep...
...so I was tired in class.
But for someone who claims to dislike horror...
...you watch those movies quite often.
It's not that I choose to watch them...
My mother's the same way.
Hey, Miyuki.
I rented this.
Want to watch?
It's too scary by myself.
The people who can't stand it...
...actually watch them more often, right?
Perhaps they want to be scared.
You're wrong, Yuki-chan!
In my case, I really can't stand them!
Iwasaki-san.
Do you know the answer to this one?
I worked on it for a while...
...and I couldn't figure it out...
...so I was going to ask Miyuki-san.
I see.
We're really lucky to have
upperclassmen to rely on in these situations.
I was talking with Iwasaki-san about that at school today.
What?!
She has that much faith in me?!
This girl is going to soon discover
how the world is a very harsh place!
Hey, Cousin Yui.
Did you ever study together with Cousin K?
Nope.
That's a common situation in games.
When a boy and girl get together
to study, they can never concentrate.
When you can't concentrate, you
start fantasizing about stuff you like.
Your hidden side starts to show.
Big Sister.
I need help with a part.
Oh, I happen to be busy, so ask Cousin Yui.
Study, study...
D-Dirty move!
M-Maybe it's 'cause I went to a different school.
I never learned this stuff.
I see.
I-It hurts...
Now I'm stuck...
Cousin Yui, do you know this one?
You probably don't!
Don't ask if you don't think I know it.
Didn't you see what just happened?
Man...
Maybe I'll call Miyuki-san.
Might be a bother for her though.
Well...
It'll probably be a bother.
Since it's late.
Why does she never...
...turn to her dad in these situations?
Rely on me sometimes!
I'll fix ya real good!
Izumi.
Don't sleep in class.
We live in an age where corporal punishment isn't allowed...
...yet you often hit people like it's no big deal.
Not that I have a problem with it.
That's true.
But I don't hit just anybody.
I choose my targets very carefully, if you get my drift.
Else I could get in trouble.
She actually said it.
Another crazy thing about her.
Besides, it doesn't make sense to ban corporal punishment.
「His life is the story of our era's most perfect man」
Jean-Paul Sartre
John Lennon
「Coolest man in the world」
Che Guevara
「Shoot, coward...
You are only going

Okay.
That's all for today.
Miyuki-san, sorry.
I don't know these era names.
Yuki-chan.
Teach me how to do this one.
Yeah...
So like...
...why don't you ever ask your teacher?!
Ms. Kuroi!
Izumi, what's up?
Well...
I had a question...
Oh.
Ask away then.
I can't really refuse.
There's this rare item in a game I'm playing right now...
Er, what?!
Teacher?!
No...
That's not what I meant...
It's always sweltering after a typhoon.
We had quite a few instances of good weather after a storm.
Like they say, stormy weather flock together.
Not bad.
By the way, what wasn't bad?
Just to make sure...
...that was supposed to be a joke, right?
Um...
I wanted to ask you something...
What's up this time?
About this morning...
Did Kona-chan say something weird?
I couldn't tell what was wrong...
We watch the news and stuff together...
...so why is she at Konata's level?
Notice for
Absent Resident
Why do you people always have such perfect timing...?
The pitcher is keeping an eye on the runner on second.
How's the baseball game going?
At this rate, it'll probably go overtime.
Again?!
Sheesh.
I have to change the recording time on the VCR.
Good grief.
They could just give it a bigger time block to begin with.
Besides...
...everybody drags out their motions in pro baseball, right?
Wouldn't they be able to finish on time...
...if they did everything at a brisker pace?
Well...
Some fans like the game because of the pace...
And the players need to concentrate.
Well?
Are you used to school yet?
Yes.
But I'm having a hard time with the huge homework load.
I see.
Third-years focus on studying for college testing...
...so they don't have much homework, huh?
Konata...
You...
Huh...
What's she talking about?
Too hot...
Bellybutton showing!
Konata!
How can you walk around dressed like that?!
What if Yu-chan copies you?!
But it's so hot lately.
You know...
It's like that thing the Diet's doing.
Cool Biz?
Yeah, that!
No, that's something different.
What were you doing?
I was wondering if I'd gotten a reply yet.
Don't you get anxious?
I was reading and I missed my stop.
Your casual slip-ups are always so cute.
Really?
Pretty sure they just cause trouble.
You have no idea.
The way she's all embarrassed when
she tries to make up for the mistake is so moe.
It's cuter when you have some kind of shortcoming.
What?
So at your job...
I spilled it!
I'm so sorry, sir!
You do stuff like that?
Kagami.
You seem kinda dumb.
What're you doing?
You're the one who started talking about it!
Though I was the one who acted it out...
So what?
Do you pretend to be clumsy...
...to score points with the customers?
I don't do anything like that.
It's a common stereotype...
...but you'll get in trouble with the manager.
Oh.
I figured you'd be like, "It's moe," and do it all the time.
You have no idea, Kagami.
Clumsy girls may be cute and moe...
...but it's pretty annoying when they cause trouble in real life.
Though you can just laugh it off in games.
You otakus can be really harsh sometimes...
If we get a perfect answer...
...courtesy of Look JT*...
...we have a one-month journey through the tundra for the prize.
Now, let us begin.
On variety shows and quiz shows...
...they always have a bunch of prizes.
I am currently at Earth's bellybutton...
Isn't it to attract more contestants?
Ayers Rock!
And if they get a big-name celebrity, the ratings will go up.
Today's mystery is located in wondrous Australia.
That's true.
Here you will find kangaroos, koalas, and other wild animals.
Well, I don't really know.
But you know...
If they let the audience participate...
...and gave them the prizes...
This continent, separated long ago by tectonic movement...
...wouldn't that boost ratings even more?
...has transformed into a holy land safe from foreign intrusion.
I have to agree...
...but that's a direct way to do business.
Morning!
Yo.
I was playing a game yesterday when I realized something...
Who's our school idol?
What is this school idol?
Like a "Miss" contest or something?
Yeah...
That's what you would think...
It's more theoretical in games...
With stuff like personal bodyguards.
Another exhausting day...
So refreshing!
I have to leave early tomorrow.
Guess I should stay off the Internet tonight...
...and hit the sack.
Don't want to be late.
I'm starting to prioritize sleep...
Is it a sign I'm getting old?
When I was in school, I skipped sleep to have fun...
Ta-Tamura-san...
Is something wrong?
You've been making a lot of faces...
Well...
You know how when you're drawing...
...you tend to make the same faces as your characters?
Really...
So you were drawing.
I didn't know that you drew manga, Tamura-san.
They're mostly doujin...
What kind of manga do you draw?
Um...
Normal stuff like four panels...
O-Or romance stuff with...
...game characters I like...
So hard to answer...
The other day, I won 3,000 yen
with a lottery ticket I randomly bought.
I was thinking how lucky I was that morning.
Amazing!
But then my bicycle tire burst on the
way to school, so I had to pay for repairs.
And my box lunch was ruined, so I had to
buy another one from a convenience store.
The money vanished so perfectly...
My 3,000 yen...
Truth is stranger than fiction...
...I suppose.
But you know...
I figure I can use this story for manga...
...so it's okay...
She's strong...
Th-The drawing hand...
...is an artist's all...
Must defend it with my life...
Sh-She's strong...
You really are skilled.
Nah...
I've been in a slump...
That one's a bust.
But this is probably one of my better recent ones.
Yeah...
Other people aren't going to notice...
...the artist's habits or subtle touches...
I already knew that...
Crap!
What's wrong, Tamura-san?
I left my favorite pencil on my
desk after I finished drawing yesterday.
Want to borrow mine?
No...
I'm no good without her...
It just feels totally different...
Yeah...
Pencils are all the same, right?
I know it's true...
Of course that's how people would react...
So I ended up lost and couldn't get out for three hours.
What's wrong, Tamura-san?
S-So embarrassing...
The hell are they thinking, wearing that in broad daylight?
A coat?
Aren't they hot wearing so much in summer?
So only people who understand can feel the agony...
Hold on.
I need to message someone.
Welcome!
Sure is crowded.
I'll go write my name on the sheet.
So I was up all night playing games with Big Sister Konata.
Suzaku-sama!
Suzaku-sama, party of three!
They called us.
But Tamura-san...
They called a different name.
In these situations...
...I always want to put down the name of my favorite character.
It, like, makes me feel closer to the character.
Haruhi
Kyon
Yuki
Mikuru
Itsuki
Current Bowler: Haruhi
You can find my people...
...everywhere!
Rely on the Nurse's Office
Thanks.
I wish I could be all slender...
...and tall like you, Iwasaki-san.
Fantasy
I admire you so much, Minami-chan.
So...
Yutaka...
Rely on the Nurse's Office
Reality
You'll still grow.
Perhaps...
...you'll grow even taller than me.
Taller than you?
Fantasy
Minami-chan!
Minami-chan!
Minami-chan...
No!
That goes against natural world order!
And the last one's totally off!
Calm down, girl!
Tamura-san, are you okay?
You look kinda pale.
Actually...
...today's the submission deadline for an upcoming event...
...and I was up all night finishing...
I just sent it out...
But when I look at how hard I can work on something...
...I feel like I'm shining.
She's strong...
Tamura-san!
What's yaoi?
Which definition are you looking for...
Good lucky!
We're already on the nineteenth episode of Lucky Channel!
Looks like we're finally in the home stretch!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
And I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi!
It's a pleasure.
Net Darling!
Anyway...
Da-Da Darling!
Akira-sama appears to be in a good mood today.
Can't do anything about adult circumstances.
Did something good happen?
What do you think?
Uh...
N-Never mind...
Being on TV really puts a strain on my nerves.
The stress really builds up after nineteen episodes.
I wish I could just soak in a spa and recuperate.
Maybe I can win that prize they
were talking about in the actual show.
That's like!
In that case...
...you have to start by appearing in the quiz show, right?
Crap...
Oh, yeah!
Traveling is great!
I'd love to travel!
Going someplace you've never been...
...really lightens your mood!
It rules!
Do you like to travel?
But of course!
I love to!
I've actually been to many places!
I've climbed Mt. Takao!
And I've been to Jogashima!
I'm definitely the outdoors type!
So you like to travel.
When you want to calm yourself down these days...
...nothing can beat a stroll through the splendor of a pristine forest!
Sounds great...
A stroll through a pristine forest.
Must really calm the soul.
Right?
Away from the hustle and bustle of the city...
...surrendering yourself to the tranquility of nature...
It heals both the body and soul!
Sounds good.
Nature might be nice.
Isn't nature great?!
Wanna go on a walk through the forest?
Seriously?!
Can I?
Well, if I can...
...I will!
Okay.
Thanks!
Then Minoru's Nature Tour's a go.
Huge.
Take 'em.
Guess they'll come in handy...
Where...
...am I going...
...exactly...?
Mt. Fuji.
But...
I've already been to the mountains...
Not the mountain.
The forest.
Go to the forests of Fuji.
The forests, huh?
Who is...
I am...
Uh...
What am I supposed to do there?
Bring me water.
Water?
I wanna drink some of that famous Fuji water...
...so go get me some.
No way!
Don't they sell that stuff at convenience stores?!
I want mine fresh!
I won't be alone, right?
Alone!
Alone?!
Someone's coming with me, right?!
Don't worry.
The director and producer are sacrificing themselves to go with you.
Lucky you.
Oh, my saviour!
Come on!
Stop wasting time!
Don't miss the deadline.
No!
Please let me go!
We're already out of time!
Everybody!
Then...
I'll do it myself!
We'll have a wonderful guest next time...
Stop!
Please stop!
...here on Lucky Channel!
You can expect something great!
Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Bye-bee!
Let go of me!
Did we really need to go through all this trouble to get rid of him?
Could have just...
This week, we would like you to enjoy the pleasant image of nature and two young women playing with bubbles.
Part of my body is hot! Hot!
Hello!
Minoru Shiraishi here!
Now, please listen to me!
How a Man Should Live!
I wanna be like him.
Also, please feel free to turn off the sound.
Always looking ahead and moving forward.
Once you've made up your mind...
...never stop.
Once you've grabbed on...
...never let go.
Body and soul are...
...bare naked.
Body and soul are...
...bare.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Nanako.
I'm Yui-chan!
I've been thinkin'...
Summer's like...
You get all excited before it starts...
...but before you know it, it's over and nothing happened, right?
Well, I guess nothing special ever happens.
Besides, you're not gonna have a long
relationship with anybody you meet during fling season.
I wouldn't know...
Well, we've still got time.
Let's both work hard.
Yes?
Hard to answer...
Next time:

You've been messing around there for a while...
...but can you even tell?
Aren't they all the same?
Isn't it common sense to do this?
Otherwise, you could spend all the money
in the world and never get what you want.
Your common sense has very little practical application.
At the very least, normal people wouldn't do it.
How
to
Spend
Summer
It isn't just about figures...
Some people are after the cards.
How can you distinguish between cards?
Don't they all weigh the same?
There have been many legends and rumors about this.
Like where to find good cards...
Or special marks or patterns to look for.
By the way, I can usually get the special cards I want.
There's a pattern to it...
...if the box was just opened.
That's pretty insane if you think about it...
...but I really don't feel like praising her!
If people know these things...
...don't the good ones get taken in no time?
That's true...
If you live in an area with experts...
...rare cards and secret figures are gone in a flash.
When I go to a shop and see all these gaps in a box...
...I'm left in despair.
But then I end up falling for that faint glimmer of hope.
It's such a problem.
You definitely have a problematic nature.
I heard some collectors...
...go out and buy a whole bunch at once?
Yeah.
Some do.
It's faster to complete a set if you buy a bunch at once...
...and it's easier to read distribution patterns that way.
Oh, really.
Well, they call it the adult purchasing
method since it's a strain on your budget.
Gotta work part-time to support it.
Adult purchasing method, huh...
They might call it an adult method...
...but they sure act immature.
It signifies a really possessive nature...
...or selfish behavior.
Maybe the young adult purchasing method would be better.
Am I the only one who thinks that
spending the effort on something else...
...would be more meaningful?
These days...
Akihabara gets a lot more media attention.
And they're obnoxious about it.
They can do stories if they want...
...but I have yet to see anything based on factual evidence.
Well, they probably exaggerate some stuff...
...but isn't that because of their audience?
But that doesn't explain how TV shows and songs...
...which were big in otaku culture first became popular.
News programs and variety shows
use anime and game music all the time.
Well...
Maybe that's because normal people wouldn't recognize it?
Speaking of otakus...
Male otakus...
...are always talking about how they want an
otaku with the same interests for a girlfriend...
...on forums and stuff.
But you never hear a female otaku
wanting to go out with another otaku.
I wonder why.
Maybe girls are more susceptible to the charms of 2-D.
Maybe they're worried about the future?
I'm sure most of them are working though...
And like, don't ask me this stuff.
They showed up as soon as it got hot.
Can't stand how they're noisy and quick to escape.
And they're dirty.
They say that Musashi Miyamoto...
...could catch flies using chopsticks.
For real?!
I can't believe he was willing to
touch those things with eating utensils.
Makes me sick.
That's your concern?
Well, I know what you mean...
Abeshi!
Wow!
I could never smack a mosquito.
Why's that?
It'd be all gross when blood got
over your hand when you crushed it.
That's true...
That's my blood.
But what if a mosquito lands on your arm?
I go, "Shoo! Shoo!"
Or I blow on it.
Did you know?
If you clench your arm when a mosquito lands on it...
...it can't pull its stinger out.
No way!
Just watch.
You are already dead.
You've already been bitten.
If you clench even harder...
...the mosquito will explode.
Stop! Stop!
It itches!
Should have just smacked it in the first place.
Itches so much!
Are you going overseas again this summer, Miyuki-san?
No.
Not this year.
However...
...we will probably visit relatives in the country.
I also often go to the summer festival
with the neighbor's daughter from Ryouou.
She's like a younger sister.
So you're going to a summer festival, Iwasaki-san.
You'd probably look great in a yukata.
Not at all...
I know that you're complimenting me...
...but for some reason, I can't appreciate it.
It's like you're saying I don't have any...
Izumi
Be right there...
Yo...
Morning...
You just woke up?!
What a slob.
Well...
Something's really been bothering me lately.
What?
Like, did my alarm clock ring?
Or like, did somebody else turn it off?
I know what you mean!
When you look, the switch is off.
But then again, it gets hot in the afternoon...
...so I can't really keep sleeping.
We're well into the afternoon.
Kona-chan.
It's morning.
Wake up.
Izumi-kun.
Let's eat lunch together.
I thought I might go home with you, Konata-kun.
Hey, Konata.
Why are the main characters in those games...
...so unconditionally popular?
Beats me...
Maybe 'cause it wouldn't be a game otherwise?
Geez!
You have to do your homework!
I-It's not like I'm worried or anything.
Fine.
I'll do it if you say so.
Hey, Konata.
Why are the heroines in those games...
...always cute with great personalities yet unattached?
You can just pick and choose.
Beats me...
Maybe 'cause it wouldn't be a game otherwise?
Yo, Konata!
I'm here to play!
While checking on Yutaka.
Good evening, Cousin Yui.
Konata?
Your father's calling for you.
Okay.
Yutaka started on her homework, so let me borrow some manga.
Er...
Don't you need to study, Konata?
Haven't you been playing this whole time?
No!
You've got it wrong!
You just have bad timing and enter whenever I'm taking a break!
GRIN
But that just means you take a lot of breaks.
And so...
...I'm concerned about my image at home...
I try to stay at my desk...
...but I end up taking a break.
Honestly...
It's because you usually don't work hard.
But well...
It's not like I don't understand how you feel.
You've had a similar experience?
Well...
If I pick up a book I really want to read during a break...
...I end up wanting to take another
break as soon as I start studying again.
It's hard to put those down in the middle.
It's the same with manga.
You say you'll stop after one more volume...
...but then you end up reading dozens more.
When you borrow the DVDs for a TV series you missed...
...you always have to watch one more episode.
But the follow-up tends to be trash.
I see.
Director, about this doll...
Big Sister.
Can I change the channel?
Sure.
I wasn't really watching.
Is there something you want to watch?
There's going to be a special on sweets from around the country.
You love sweets, right?
I bet Kagami and Tsukasa will watch, too.
It's like the Hare Hare Dance of sweets!
That looks great!
With these shows...
...even if you find something good...
...it ends up being sold somewhere far
away and you're left disappointed, right?
We live in Saitama, so Nagoya's kinda...
That always happens...
...but I still end up watching.
Too bad.
Summer Classes ————
Good morning, Yuki-chan.
Um, what's wrong?
I went to the dentist's yesterday.
You're still going?
I ran away halfway through...
Let me know if it hurts.
It'll be over soon.
Something like that...
That's right!
They never stop!
It hurts to just hear about it!
We already have summer classes...
...but homework on top of that?
Screw that.
It's summer vacation.
It's not like you do it yourself anyway.
Besides...
...unlike grade school and middle school...
...we don't have independent projects or book reports.
Isn't this easier?
You just have to answer questions.
We made crafts and posters, too.
With that stuff...
...you end up getting your parents' help.
And then they get so into it that they finish it, right?
I won a prize off of that once.
With a poster or something.
I remember that.
I was like, "It's all thanks to you, Dad.
I think you're even cooler now!"
And Dad was all happy about it.
Shouldn't a parent be mad about that?
Buy at least five at once!
Whenever I see this commercial...
...I always get jealous.
When I was little...
...and read that fairy tale about a gingerbread house...
...I wanted to try eating all the candy I could!
I know what you mean...
...but when you actually get a lot of what you want...
...you tend to lose interest.
Really...
Yeah.
It stinks the whole year.
So I was thinking...
About summer homework...
I'm always in trouble 'cause I plan
to do it in one go in the latter half.
That came out of nowhere.
And I didn't need you to tell me that.
If I worked at it little by little...
...I might not have to scramble at the end.
You just realized that?
You're a third-year already.
Don't burn yourself out.
Which means I'll be coming over tomorrow so thanks.
I'll bring a present.
So that's what you meant by little by little?
Are you going to come over all summer?
Probably every week.
Shut up!
Yo...
It's hot...
Yo.
Sure is.
The A/C's on in my room.
So comfortable!
You sure are making yourself at home...
It's like this every year.
Summer always passes without me wanting to do anything.
Before I know it, summer vacation's over.
Stop sounding so lazy.
Set milestones this year...
...and get your homework done.
Well...
I plan on working hard before summer vacation begins every year.
Really?
In manga...
You see the whole "I didn't do my homework!" gag used a lot...
...this time of year.
That's true.
When you look at that...
...don't you think that in theory, you don't need to do it?
If that's what everybody else is doing...
Of course not!
Do it.
Besides, if you're gonna be like this, don't come to copy!
I'm thirsty.
I'll go get some barley tea.
Sis!
Sorry...
Could you also get the math problem set from my room?
Pretty please.
Yeah, yeah.
So hot!
You don't want to leave an air conditioned room...
...so you ask someone else to do it when they leave...
...but nobody else wants to leave, huh?
In winter, you don't want to leave the kotatsu...
...so you ask someone else to do stuff for you when they get up.
Hey.
Yo!
Sure is hot.
Yo.
Welcome.
I brought ice cream.
Take whichever one you want.
Since I won't be much help with homework.
And the Marimokkori's eyes...
In these situations...
...why is it that you always want the ones other people chose?
I'm reading this manga about getting into Tokyo U.
That one, huh?
When you read that...
...don't you start thinking that you
might have a chance to get into Tokyo U?
If you work hard like them!
You sure are simple.
Even if that method could get you into Tokyo U...
You'd need friends who abandon their regular classes to join in...
Teachers who hold class like that...
Someone to take charge.
And all kinds of other things for it to work, right?
You're right...
It's not that easy...
Too many people...
...get influenced by manga or TV shows
and think they can change themselves.
Well...
I plan on working hard and studying...
...but I always get sleepy.
Is there a good way to stay awake?
I think it's better to take a little nap...
...than to force yourself to stay awake.
Oh, really?
I heard that before, so I gave it a try...
But my little nap ended up being a lot longer...
...yeah?
No willpower...
Hello!
Hello, Yutaka-chan.
Hello.
Um, do you have a minute?
What's up, Yu-chan?
You can ask us anything.
A friend from middle school apparently got a boyfriend...
...and she asked me what she should give him for his birthday.
I have no idea...
What do I do...
It got really awkward...
A-Anyway, Yu-chan...
They have web sites that discuss this stuff...
...so you should take a look.
There might be a thread about it.
You can use my computer.
I-I'll do that.
I know about Tra** Man...
...but you can even ask questions about this stuff.
It's pretty common these days.
Anything goes, huh?
That's right.
They probably have the answers for math problems, too.
It makes me think how kids these days have it so easy.
As technology and the community advance...
...the users' mindsets and willpower are getting worse.
Just look at her.
Huh?
That's odd...
I'm just copying homework...
...but unlike usual...
...the presence of an audience creates this pride-like feeling...
Oh, yeah.
What about the festival at your place?
What are you talking about?
It's already over.
Wha—
Same as last year.
Why didn't you tell me?!
We have to study for exams.
If we told you, you'd definitely want to go.
We didn't go either.
Doesn't have to be ours...
Just go to the one where you live.
Is it already over?
Where I live...?
Yeah, I wonder when that is...
Yeah...
Some people go to festivals in other places...
...but don't even care about the ones where they live.
Are you the type who avoids friends from back home?
Even college applicants can't go on studying forever.
That's right...
There's going to be a fireworks display near my home tomorrow.
That's it!
Let's all go have fun for once!
Guess so.
We could use a break.
That's right.
There's going to be a fireworks display
near your home tomorrow, Minami-chan.
I'd like to see Japanese fireworks.
Then let's all go together, Minami.
Minami-chan.
Are you free tomorrow?
I'm good.
Then it's decided, Minami.
Let's go, Iwasaki-san.
Huh?
Iwasaki-san?
It's a pretty famous fireworks display...
...Mi—
Iwasaki-san.
It's hard to change how you call
someone once you've gotten used to it.
But it's far away and famous, so it'll be crowded, right?
Will you be okay, Yu-chan?
Weren't you sick a while back?
It's going to be hot tomorrow so should we wait for the next one?
You don't have to worry about me.
It happens all the time.
I'm the class health officer, and I'll be coming...
...so it'll be okay...
...Yutaka.
That's right.
You're right.
Thanks, Minami-chan!
So we're going to see fireworks...
...but otherwise, it's college application and study time.
It sucks how I have less time to play.
'Cause Kagami and the others are all serious.
Well, I can understand.
You should just do what you want.
I used to drag Kanata around...
...and made lots of memories.
I got in trouble...
...but adolescence doesn't wait!
Then maybe I should get a boyfriend and make some memories.
Absolutely not!
I won't accept a boyfriend!
Well, Dad...
You're not making sense.
That's right.
Wanna come watch fireworks with us, Yu-chan?
Actually, I'm also going.
We're meeting up at Minami-chan's place.
Really...
We're leaving!
Have fun!
The train's here!
You're late.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Yutaka-chan came along.
Um...
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Over here!
Hello.
Hey.
Hiya.
Patricia-san.
Are you also here for the fireworks?
You look good in a yukata.
What the heck?!
Iwasaki
Huh?
So Miyuki-san's neighbor was Minami-chan.
What a coincidence.
What a surprise.
Welcome.
Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Oh?
Not enough?
There should be enough...
Mom.
Did you count yourself?
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
My.
You're right.
Now I get it.
Thanks for having us!
So this is Minami-chan's house.
Scary big dog...
Don't worry.
It doesn't bark.
And it's really friendly.
I see.
When they're big and friendly...
...it's actually kinda cute.
Huh?
It's growling at me...
Maybe she's the type who tends to get barked at.
When I was little...
...I would wonder if fireworks were still round from the side.
Huh?
So they don't look flat?
Hey now...
They show firework displays on TV occassionally...
...but there's a better atmosphere when you watch the real thing.
You're right.
But you know...
I've been thinking...
Every time they launch a big one...
...and announce that this was
sponsored by some business or other...
...doesn't that ruin the mood?
Th-That's true.
Huh?
Yu-chan.
You look a little pale.
I'm okay.
It's okay...
...so go watch.
But...
I'll...
...stay here.
Minami-chan.
That was wonderful.
Yeah.
This is what summer's all about.
But you know...
It never ends up being a beautiful memory like in manga.
I got bitten everywhere.
So itchy!
They say that it itches more if you scratch.
And when you take off the yukata, it itches under the belt.
That's right.
Beautiful.
It really was.
But sorry for causing you trouble.
There you are.
Hey.
Were you guys bitten by bugs, too?
We weren't bitten at all.
So some people are easily bitten and some aren't.
So lucky.
Nah.
Maybe the mosquitos read the mood.
Good lucky!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
I'm the assistant...
Daisuke Ono.
We're already on the twentieth episode of Lucky Channel!
You're not a crow today.
You're not a dog today.
Then let's have a look at the live feed.
Forest
Studio
I wonder where he is right now.
That Shiroishi-kun.
Mt. Fuji's so pretty!
Whatever.
Then bye-bee!
Bye-bee!
Shiraishi-kun?
Shiraishi-kun?!
Ma'am!
This is what you wanted, right?
Hello, Minoru Shiraishi here!
Now, please listen to me!
Bridegroom Rumba!
One, two, three, four!
Merry voices ring through the air...
...at a church in June.
The phrase "happiest moment of my life" was...
...made for such a time.
If I'd known this would happen...
...I wouldn't have bought that new house.
Getting jilted by the bride...
...is like something out of manga.
All worked up, I break into the Bridegroom Rumba.
Somebody save me.
Oh, my god!
What am I going to do now?!
Even my boss is here!
One, two, three! Two, Two, three!
Bridegroom Rumba!
Cha-la!
Cha-la-la!
Cha!
Cha!
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:

Hey, Ayano.
Isn't Hiiragi so heartless?
She always runs off to the midget's class.
There, there.
Does our love not reach Hiiragi?!

Morning, you two.
Yo.
Good morning.
You remembered to wear your winter uniform.
Come on...
It's not like I'm Tsukasa.
What?!
But the hot weather isn't over yet...
They could let us wear our summer uniforms a little longer.
And when we have to wear
summer uniforms, it gets cold sometimes...
They should just let us choose.
Right?
The switch is more to give students a change in pace.
Else there would be more slackers like you two.
Pandora's
Box
This doesn't happen in our family...
...but I've heard that some parents monitor...
...their daughters' cell phones and e-mail.
I've heard of that on occasion.
Is it like that for you?
Probably not.
Your dad's the type to smother...
...but I guess he wouldn't do anything you wouldn't like.
That might be part of it...
My dad also uses the computer.
Maybe it's 'cause he knows how
embarrassing it is when someone else looks at your D drive.
D...
What?
We've had all these classes and stuff this summer...
In the end...
I only got to have fun with the fireworks and Ariake.
So you still go to Comiket.
Comiket?!
Well, you know...
As a result, my wallet's feeling pretty lonely.
How much did you spend?
You never know when to draw the line.
If you assume each book is a thousand yen...
Around forty to fifty thousand yen total?
Why you...
There's a limit to how clueless a
person can be about the value of money!
Still, Kagami...
There's this thing called market price.
And it's pretty expensive to publish your own stuff.
That's not what I meant!
I'm talking about how you don't
feel anything after spending so much!
It may be September...
...but it's still hot.
That's right.
It seems especially hot this year.
And there's talk about global warming.
Yu-chan can't put up with too much heat...
...so she's been resting in an air-conditioned room most of the time.
That's what Tsukasa's been doing the whole time.
But she's just lazy.
Well...
Dad and I join in...
...and we all lie around looking like a 小 character.
小?
Shouldn't it be 川?
Nah.
Dad's always in the middle.
Your family never changes.
And I guess Yutaka-chan's gotten used to it.
Hey, hey!
Doing good, Yutaka?
I'm here to play!
Sis!
Oh?
Who's this?
My friend...
Minami Iwasaki-chan.
So this is the Minami-chan Yutaka's always talking about.
S-Sis!
So she has a reason for hope right next to her...
I'm a little jealous.
Man...
I'd heard all the fuss...
...but you sure are pretty.
You wowed me!
Want something to drink?
Beer then!
Huh?!
Didn't you drive here?!
Just kiddin'!
Barley tea's fine!
I see.
One absorbs from the other...
Absorption, is it...?
Oh...
[Yassai Mossai - a Japanese folk dance]
It's the Yassai Mossai?
I always get sleepy at night.
Do you have any good ideas?
Instead of forcing yourself to stay up...
...why don't you wake up early and work on it?
You'll probably feel better.
I see!
You're right!
I'll wake up early and work hard.
Huh?
Why is it the same time I always get up?
Come to think of it...
I vaguely remember turning something off at some point...
Even when I wake up early...
...I just roll over and go back to sleep.
You have no willpower...
Maybe I should just try harder...
...and work on it at night.
I doubt rubbing your eyes while nodding off...
...will improve the results.
Why don't you have someone wake you up?
Mom and the others wake up early.
Right, Mom?
Yes, yes.
I'll wake you up.
This can't fail.
Sis is amazing.
Mom!
I told you to wake me up!
I did.
You even answered me back.
I don't know anything about that.
You don't remember?
Big Sister forgot her lunch...
Thanks!
It feels kind of weird to walk
through the hallway of a different grade.
You can feel a little pressure...
I know what you mean.
Yu-chan probably drew everybody's attention.
Being the way she is...
Usually, it's just your imagination...
...but when you walk through
upperclassmen or underclassmen hallways...
...you get this feeling that everybody's looking at you, right?
I already tend to stand out 'cause I'm smaller...
...but when it's because they're
upperclassmen, the pressure is more intense.
I enjoy receiving that kind of attention.
Really...
But I don't attract much attention when I'm in the first-year's area.
They don't realize I'm an upperclassman.
Holds no power as an upperclassman.
Patty-chan.
Hi!
Hello there.
Are you heading to work?
That's right.
I signed up for too many shifts this week.
Aren't you still working?
That's right.
We're pretty popular.
The A-boys are all over us.
A-boys?
It's what you call boys who look like they totally belong in Akiba.
But Narimiya-kun was a little different.
You're getting accustomed to Japan.
A little too accustomed, don't you think?
I just had a great idea!
I'll write it down once I'm done with my bath.
H-Huh?
I can't remember...
This is what happens when I don't jot it down immediately...
And it was funny...
Hilarious, even!
Another exhausting day...
That might be a funny idea.
I'll write it down when I wake up tomorrow.
Er...
That's weird...
What was it again?
I'm positive it was a good idea.
Should have just gotten out of bed and written it down.
Man!
I even got out of bed this time!
Why do you forget dreams so quickly?
I'm positive that it was hilarious!
School Trip
Kyoto & Nara
So...
Make sure you all talk it over within your group.
Kyoto ・ Nara
Since we're going all the way to Kyoto and Nara...
...you better check up on all the hot tourist spots.
Aren't we going through all the hot spots by bus?
Those will just be the typical places...
...so they won't be that fun.
Well now...
That's a blunt way to put it...
So Iris came in here...
I will now guide you through the former capital of Nara.
Almost 1,300 years have passed since it became the capital in 710.
While in Nara...
...I hope you enjoy my historical Nara narration.
Nara!
Nara narration!
Were we supposed to laugh?
Sorry for the wait!
This is the main body...
So the little things around it are options!
You're gonna get hit by lightning.
No!
I'm all sticky...
And stinky...
I'm all stinky now!
Here, here, here.
Indeed.
What's that supposed to mean?
Please, please.
They probably want you to take their picture.
Um... Um...
Click. Click.
Okay?
This is when you can tell how much somebody's been studying.
Like you're one to talk.
Um...
Sis.
How do you say "cheese" in Indian?
You mean Hindi, right?
Um...
Uh...
Genius girl Kagami can't do any better.
Um...
I believe that Indians will understand English.
That's right!
"Say cheese!" should be fine, yeah?
Okay.
Say cheese!
You know how...
...couples pop out of nowhere during school trips?
Can't miss the school trip event.
Perhaps...
...being away from school...
...gives people a sense of freedom?
Kinda like a now or never thing.
I'm embarrassed to say that...
...I'm unable to sleep with a different pillow.
I'm embarrassed to say that...
...I can't sleep peacefully without this nearby.
I'm embarrassed to say that...
...I can't sleep if I haven't turned
this on at least once during the day.
Everyone.
The bus will soon pass Kiyomizu Temple.
The hill leading to Kiyomizu Temple...
...is known as Three-year Hill.
Legend says that...
...if you trip and fall here, you'll die in three years.
Three-year Hill will become...
...your Boo-hoo Hill.
Does it count if you break down laughing?
Okay?
We'll be moving around in individual groups now.
Keep an eye out for traffic.
We'll regroup at 12:30 in front of Chion-in.
Don't be late.
Anybody who's late gets to write a
happy 20-page report when we get back.
Sure about that?
Let's give it a try.
The Dragon Slayer's probably about this heavy.
We're really high up.
You know how the saying goes,
"Like you're going to jump off Kiyomizu..."
...but if you really jumped, wouldn't you die?
Does it mean that you no longer care what happens?
You're so pragmatic, Kagami.
Look, look!
It says marriage.
This place seems to be famous for its god of marriage.
They really spell it out for you.
Look.
You can draw love fortunes.
Let's all give it a try.
Let's do it!
Guess I can't tell these apart...
Isn't that obvious?
This one!
Great fortune!
Lucky you, Kona-chan.
My.
I drew good fortune.
That's fine.
Now what did I get...
Half fortune?
What's this?
I-I guess you only get half a fortune.
Which means it's half bad.
Not like I care about love fortunes.
So cute!
That looks nice.
Nah.
Kagami would want this.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'll get one of these.
Kagami! Kagami!
You forgot this!
I'm not buying it!
Then what about this?
No!
You should be careful.
Marriage Wishes
This one says, "Konata is my wife."
Okay.
Everyone's here, right?
We'll have lunch after we've gone in the hotel.
Let's get going.
Take us there, please.
They said that Koizumi's character
song was written in an IZAM style.
Teacher!
Someone's chasing us from behind!
What?!
This is like the Hokkaido shoot all over again!
Don't ditch me!
You have to go, "***tel!"
That idiot.
He's getting assigned a 50-page report!
Driver!
Sorry, could you stop for a second?
See you later.
Hiiragi
I'd like to talk.
Please meet me in
front of the hotel
at 9pm.
-From a certain boy
Doesn't even hurt!
The Golden Pavilion Temple is golden...
...but the Silver Pavilion Temple isn't silver, huh?
They wanted to group it with the Golden Pavilion Temple...
Click.
...so they named it silver to go along with golden.
Click.
It was never silver to begin with.
Click.
I wonder if it's like Poke***...
With Sapphire and Ruby and stuff.
No comment?
Our family's shrine was on the news.
We only have one day left.
Our plan for free time is all set.
Tomorrow is the beginning of our true school trip!
Off we go to the holy land!
Right...
D-Does this count as being in front of the hotel?
Did you wait long?
So...
What did you want to talk about?
You're the only person I can talk to about this.
Please give me that doll!
Doll?
You know...
The one you bought from the Kiyomizu Temple souvenir shop!
The Yatsuhashi character.
Ya-Yatsuhashi-kun?
Yeah!
That one!
I really liked it and wanted one.
But if someone saw me buying one...
...they'd probably all make fun of me!
I'm begging you!
Thank you!
I'm eternally in your debt!
Don't tell anybody about this!
Yes, yes.
I'm reading this book about four brothers.
****** of the Dragon Kings?
I can't take it off!
That's right.
Come to think of it...
That could make a pretty good anime.
The steam within cooled off...
...and formed a vacuum.
They did an anime adaptation a while back.
If you press on the sides a little...
Really?
...that should allow air to enter and make the lid easier to remove.
I had no idea!
I think they went up to the fourth volume of the original.
In that case...
But those books are...
I'm sorry!
So sorry!
Putting on a show till the very end.
I've already looked up the directions.
Is it really okay for us to visit?
We'll just be looking from the outside, so it's okay.
There's no need to go that far just 'cause we're in Kyoto.
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
You don't understand an otaku's idea of romance.
I don't want to.
Not much here.
It makes it easier to concentrate on their job, so this works.
It's a pretty ordinary-looking building.
They limit their workload, so this works.
Was it really necessary to buy these in Kyoto?
That's embarrassing!
Who cares?
It's a little something for remembering this day!
Sis!
Let's take a picture together!
It's for commemorating this trip.
Since we came all the way to Kyoto.
What does this have to do with Kyoto?
Tsukasa and I made it back in one piece.
Tsukasa's already asleep, though.
I figured you'd be sulking in bed.
Why would I be doing that?
Did you put up the sticker photo?
How could I put up something so embarrassing?
Something so embarrassing....
The school trip was this week...
I sure worked hard.
Okay.
Time to spend the weekend gaming online for once.
Emergency Maintenance Notice
Due to an unexplained server error
at 8:30 PM, the server is currently
undergoing emergency maintenance.
Good lucky!
Here's another crazy episode of Lucky Channel!
I'm your navigator, Akira Kogami!
I'm the assistant...
Daisuke Ono.
Lucky Channel is already on the twenty-first episode!
That's right.
We're finally getting close to the end.
Well, then...
Let's get straight to this corner...
This week's...
Bend!
Who is it?
What?
I brought your water.
What is this?!
It's warm!
How am I supposed to drink this?!
I'd rather have something out of a vending machine.
Don't mess with me!
You...
Why, you...
What do you think I've had to put up with this whole time?!
All your damn selfish requests one after the next!
Mi-Minoru?
Well, I'm gonna speak my mind today!
Do you know how I felt when I was doing this corner?!
I'd have to work at CoCo**** every day!
That's better pay than my voice acting work!
Thanks to you, I'm working full-time now!
Before I come kiss your ass here...
...I'm over there frying cutlets!
Which means you're more suited for that work.
And what the hell?!
Why are you sitting there, Ono boy?!
That's my seat!
You were abandoned.
By the director and the producer.
What's that?!
They acted too quickly!
I'm a late bloomer!
I can go from here to Starga**r in no time!
You can?
Really?
Sittin' there making fun of me...
Screw working with Hine**su...
Or Lo** and Be***...
I quit.
I quit this stupid show, damn it!
Take that!
Who gives a damn about Lucky Channel?!
Shiraishi Minoru-san!
What are you doing, morons?!
What are you filming there?!
What's with the Cape of Thirty Years?!
If you wanna play with that...
...I'm gonna be thirty soon!
I'm talking about you...
Welcome to Idaho!
The belt isn't long enough, so she's holding it up from behind.
Hello.
Minoru Shiraishi here!
Yeah.
Okay!
Now please listen!
Don't wanna hear it.
The Dentistman Song!
What is this?
The sound of my drill rings through the universe!
What does that even mean?
Yeah, yeah.
Any enemy will fall after one hit!
Stop moving.
Right.
Striving to protect everyone's dreams...
Stop moving!
I head forth giving my all!
Wait, Akira-san!
Th-The enemy is the cavity monster from hell!
Sheesh.
Right.
I'll show you my Drill of Justice!
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now is the time!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Eliminate them!
T-twin drill!
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Stop moving!
Shatter them!
Eradicate them!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
For I am...
I am...
I am Dentistman!
Can I let go?
Dentistman is...
Dentistman is...
Don't screw up your lines!
...is a cyborg.
He...
He will...
You can't be a hero like that.
...continue fighting to defeat the evil cavities!
You can't fight like that.
How was it?
No good.
Redo.
Yes, ma'am.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Akira Kogami!
I'm Daisuke Ono.
Okay.
That's it for the animal talk.
That was in animal, huh?
Next time:
「There Over Here」

Thanks for treating us today, Cousin Yui!
Anytime!
Don't mention it!
That was good, right?
Right?
Don't you feel happy when the egg tastes good?
The price of gas went up two yen since yesterday...
Should've filled up the tank...
Why is it that people who spend generously...
...care so much about a one yen difference in the price of gasoline?
There
Over
Here
That's right...
That book I lent you a while ago is
apparently getting turned into a game.
I won't be buying it though.
You're so behind, Kagami.
I reserved the limited edition as soon as it was announced.
I even bought the DVD box set for
the anime and other related goods.
You're more hooked than I am.
It's pretty common for people to become bigger
fans than the people who recommend stuff to them.
That's how Cousin Yui chose her car.
Thanks to someone else's influence.
Her car?!
I lent her a racing manga...
That sure surprised me.
It's scary how much energy people put into their hobbies...
Yesterday was the third win in a row, right?
It's the start of a miracle!
If they keep on winning...
What are they talking about?
...the playoffs and Japan Series aren't out of the question.
Probably pro baseball, I believe.
All the way to the top!
Teacher enjoys it.
Besides, baseball's all about...
Speaking of baseball...
The famous poet, Shiki Masaoka...
...apparently loved baseball a great deal.
He played catcher...
...until he was too ill.
And he took his childhood name, Noboru...
...wrote it using the characters for baseball...
...and pronounced it Noball.
By the way...
The winners of the Major League
are called the world champions, right?
Talking about the Japan Series reminded me.
That's right.
Even when it only includes American teams.
Well, they should beat our team before
they call themselves world champions, right?
She's awfully pumped up...
It sure stinks.
It sure does.
There you are!
Kagami!
Miyuki-san!
Konata.
Teach me how to do these!
This is unusual.
You asking a question about schoolwork.
Some of these problems are quite difficult.
That's cause they're from an arcade quiz game.
I'm not good with academic stuff.
There you go again...
And put more effort into your studying.
You're applying for college.
I may be like this here...
...but they call me a sage over there!
In that case...
...just enroll in that whatever academy of yours.
Which is why I didn't get enough sleep.
How long were you up playing?
You say you're always in bed by eleven, Miyuki-san?
That's early.
Wait.
Now I get it...
「Sleeping helps
you grow ☆」
So I was thinking when I looked at Miyuki-san...
...but you haven't grown much considering how much you sleep.
That's what Big Sister said.
I'm really sensitive about that.
That night, around 9 o'clock
Excuse me for calling so late.
My name is Kobayakawa.
Is this the Iwasaki residence?
Thank you.
May I speak with Minami-chan?
She already went to bed?
Did she always sleep this early?
Pittan.
La-la moji pittan.
You're having fun singing.
Yes, we'll make do.
It's okay.
Yes.
I'll let my father know.
After the ground-breaking ceremony.
That's right.
No, of course not!
Please, there you go again...
I'm underage, really.
You've got it wrong!
It's not like that!
Then bye.
Yes.
Yes!
You know, Kagami...
They can't see you gesturing.
I know that!
It's just a force of habit!
Oh, yeah...
When I'm on the phone, I have to concentrate, so I stop gaming...
...but then my empty hand starts feeling lonely...
I know what you mean.
So the other day...
...I was using a roller to get rid of dust the whole time.
Roll! Roll!
Stuff like that can get pretty addictive.
Like random doodling or menial chores.
But you know...
Once you get off the phone, that stuff gets old really fast.
It's kinda depressing when only the area around you is clean.
You could just finish the job.
My passion fades with the conversation.
So you just leave it like that?
That guy's kinda stinky, yeah?
I guess it's okay every now and then.
Look!
**cky!
Po***!
I used to do that...
...back in grade school.
Seriously...
Are you a little kid?
But...
Speaking of things we did when we were little...
...I used to stir my yogurt...
...and go, "Bread factory!"
Bread factory?
Haven't heard of it?
Hey, what was that just now?
Bread factory?
Don't be embarrassed. Just 'fess up.
Shut up!
About that game I lent you back during first semester...
Someone else wants to play it.
So give it back.
Gotcha.
Is it for the squirt?
Reminds me...
I've lent a bunch to her.
I should get them back.
But you sure are amazing, Hiiragi.
What do you mean?
Well...
The other day, I found these games and
didn't remember who I borrowed them from...
I'm impressed you can remember.
Hey now...
And there are some I lent to other people that I've forgotten about.
You're way too careless.
Nah.
There's gotta be a Law of Equal Lending.
It's a universal principle.
As if...
Yes?
Hello?
Hiiragi?
It's me.
Misao.
Yeah, what's u—
Damn...
Not bad, Potemkin...
Wh-What?
Is something wrong?
Nah.
No big deal...
Sorry, sorry.
So?
What do you want?
Well...
What was it again?
I wouldn't know.
It was something super important...
Don't forget it if it's important.
I was looking at the numbers for the Autumn Jumbo Lottery...
...but mine were all off.
Guess it's not so easy to win.
I sent in a bunch of postcards...
...but I didn't win any prizes from the drawing.
Really...
That's too bad...
When you never win...
...you start to wonder if the vendors or
editors are running some kind of scam, right?
Konata!
You shouldn't be so suspicious of other people!
No good...
I'm gonna call it a night.
I'll go to the bathroom first.
They tell me that I talk to myself too much...
But that doesn't matter.
I was really sleepy...
...so why am I so awake after that weird joke?
Next day, dead of night
I really can't do this at night.
I'm not feeling it tonight...
I should get to bed while I'm dozing off.
It's freezing!
I was really sleepy...
...so why am I so awake just 'cause it's cold under the covers?
The day after that, dead of night
It's useless...
It's warm tonight...
Maybe I can fall asleep quickly.
My legs are really hot for some reason...
I can't fall asleep!
Why is that?
Does this only happen to me?
It's the season for baked sweet potatoes!
Well, Kagami...
You know...
Yeah, I know.
I know, so don't say it.
Want some?
Thanks so much.
But you'll gain weight.
You still said it.
But I can't help it!
Once I've made eye contact with the guy...
...it'd be rude not to buy one, right?
You know...
"Will she buy one?"
"My feelings will be hurt if she doesn't."
That look!
I know what you mean.
If you make eye contact at Comiket...
...it's really hard to put a book back.
You don't care when other people have
no idea what you're talking about, huh...
Come on...
I'm talking about when you're hanging around a circle's booth.
When you pick up a book in front of a sales rep...
...you feel pretty bad if you leave without buying it.
But you still put it back, don't you?
There's been an increase in the number
of light novels being adapted to anime.
Looks like it.
The novel I lent you...
...has already had three anime adaptations.
And there should be a new volume coming out soon.
I've watched the anime...
...but I haven't read the novels.
Too much text makes me tired.
That again, huh...
Don't the games you always play have a lot more text?
They should, but it's weird...
It'd really help if they released them in a visual novel format.
Hey!
More importantly...
When are they doing the fourth season of the anime?
Um...
What?
Is that some kind of reference?
Yu-chan...
What are you doing over there?
Th-The lid always ends up crooked.
Well, some people are like that.
I guess it's clumsiness.
I do it all the time.
Here.
You share some cute flaws with Miyuki-san.
Thanks!
You sure are amazing, Big Sister.
What do I do, Big Sister?
Now I can't open it.
Oops.
I used my usual strength.
You sure are a lot of trouble.
You can't open the bag?
Hand it here.
Big Sister!
Thanks!
Huh?
How about we just tear it along the notches?
No!
O-One sec!
I'll open it, so hold on!
Fire...
It's okay.
We can just tear along the notches or use scissors.
No, that would hurt my pride!
Or make me feel like a loser!
Big Sister, is it a mosquito?
Mosquito!
Don't you get annoyed when you know something's there?
Even when you haven't been bitten yet.
Once you know it's there...
...you must take it down!
That's the instinct of a hunter!
I was thinking...
If a guy in the same year professed his love for Yu-chan or me...
...wouldn't that guy be a lolicon?
They're in the same class year...
...so technically, they wouldn't.
But in this case, it feels like appearance holds more weight...
Say, if...
...you were a 30-year-old who
looked like someone in grade school...
Then you could say the guy likes older women...
This is a complicated issue.
It's hard to come up with a strict definition.
You're definitely my dad.
Kagami would have just ended it with, "Who cares?!"
So what about you, Dad?
You fell in love with Mom...
Mom
Daughter
...and you dote on me...
...which means you're a lolicon, right?
No, wait.
Hold it right here.
That's not entirely accurate.
I'm not limited to little girls.
I also like normal girls.
So you should say that I'm also a lolicon.
Well, it basically depends on the character.
Either way, you fail as a human being.
Okay...
You know how you're always so clingy?
Would you still be like that if I were a boy?
Of course!
Okay.
I totally understand now.
Aren't you glad I'm a girl?
Uh...
I think the bath should be ready.
You go first, Yu-chan.
Then excuse me.
He chased her away 'cause he was looking bad.
Hey, Dad.
About Mom...
She was short...
...and your childhood friend...
Isn't she like a character out of a gal game?
Right?
She was adorable since she was little.
I can understand why you fell for her...
...but why did she marry you?
I once said, "You wouldn't accept me...
...so I ended up as a gal game lover!"
And she just said yes...
You're despicable!
But it's the truth.
Isn't that coercion?!
No, no...
That wasn't the only reason, obviously...
And she was really happy when you were born...
Oh.
Doesn't this mole make her look like you, Sou-kun?
Well...
She has your eyes.
You can definitely tell she's our child.
But I hope she doesn't grow up like us.
I hope she doesn't inherit my height...
...or your personality...
Pretty harsh...
But why did you suddenly mention her?
I don't know much about Mom.
Konata.
Are you lonely without Mom around?
Not really.
You create as much excitement as two people would.
And Yu-chan's here.
I see...
Kanata...
Konata's grown up to be a good girl.
a little anime geek
Though she's not as normal as you wanted...
Hey, Konata.
Please don't die before I do.
For now, I have no intention of doing so.
That's good.
Kanata died young...
...but she said she was happy and smiled at the end.
It's hard on those left behind...
...but I want to be like that at the end.
Smiling?
So how do you want to die?
Let's see...
Death by over-arousal?
You're definitely going to have a bizarre death!
That's right...
I bought a digital camera for work today...
I haven't been back in a while.
You're so annoying!
Come on!
I wonder what...
Just one more!
Okay?
Geez! I'm in the middle of a game!
...they're doing right now.
Okay! Okay!
Okay! Cheese!
Come on, Dad!
Okay, one more!
That's enough already.
And Dad, you're way too close.
You're so heartless, Konata.
We're taking photos to commemorate this new camera!
Didn't you buy this for work?
Don't be such a stiff!
Honestly...
Sou-kun hasn't changed.
One more picture!
That's enough.
That's right, you never did...
You're such a pest.
...pay much attention to what other people wanted.
Take that!
Ow.
That hurts, Konata!
You really haven't changed.
But you know...
You feel more and more like Kanata when I hold you.
It makes my heart race.
Hey!
Don't just blurt out risqué statements!
I can see what Mom had to put up with...
What was that?!
Indeed...
Your dad may be like that...
...but don't turn into a bad person.
That's right, Konata.
Teach me that one game once you clear it.
Okay.
That one's surprisingly difficult.
But...
I think I made a wrong choice somewhere...
They play games together...
...so it looks like they're getting along.
I can't make it to the H-scene for the character I want.
Wait!
What are you letting your daughter play?!
Geez...
Is this really okay?
Aren't you teaching her the wrong things, Sou-kun?
Hey.
Why did Mom choose you?
'Cause you're just an old, perverted, lolicon otaku.
People usually don't go for that.
That's a little harsh.
You don't go easy on your old man, huh?
For real.
But that's right...
Honestly...
Kanata had really good intuition.
You were always like this...
Always making me almost forget...
Maybe it was fate.
...why I chose to spend...
Even though I failed as a human being...
...my life with this man.
...there was one thing I was absolutely sure about.
One thing you were absolutely sure about?
What was that?
I was...
...the one who loved Kanata most in this world.
That was it.
I just can't beat you.
Results for the
New Writer Award
No recipients
He accepts my good and bad parts.
He's willing to show both...
...his good and bad parts.
The place I feel most at ease...
The place that lets me feel most at ease...
Yeah?
Okay!
That's enough reminiscing.
Should we take another one?
We'll do one with Yu-chan later, okay?
The fact that I can no longer be there...
That's enough...
And that would be more than one picture.
...hurts a little.
It's all good.
You bought this for your hobby, didn't you?
Geez.
What are you talking about?
I'm just testing it out before I take pictures for work.
But...
Man...
If I can live on inside them...
...the way the two of them exist inside me...
...I'll continue to watch over them.
There!
Here we go!
May the ones who brought me so much joy...
Okay.
...be blessed with happiness.
Cheese!
I wonder if they'll be surprised.
D-Dad!
This picture...
There's a shadow back there...
A real ghost picture...
H-Huh?
I'm done with my bath.
Yu—
Yu-Yu-Yu-Yu-chan!
W-Wait!
L-L-Look at this!
What is it?
What's wrong?
D-Delete it!
We have to delete it!
We'll be cursed!
S-Stop!
Don't delete it!
Wait!
Deleting it isn't enough!
Don't we have to burn it?
Don't burn it!
Now that I've talked with her...
...I have a different impression of her...
...but Mina-rin still seems a little scary.
But she's really nice.
She's back!
Minami-chan!
Welcome back!
I'm back.
Those two are really close.
You had classroom duty today, right?
Was the teacher still in the faculty office?
This would be...
Yutaka, your tie is crooked.
B-Big Sister..

I'm looking at my friends weird again...
Maybe it's been building up.

So did you find them?
Can't find them anywhere?
And you can't find their managers?
They ran away...
Well, either way, they're fired.
Uh...
Besides...
It's rolling...
I had a bad feeling about this show from the beginning!
U-Uh...
You know?
Fact...
I actually refused in the beginning.
But all that politics crap.
Grown-up issues and whatnot.
Uh...
Uh, it's rolling.
What's rolling?
Me?
You?
Or the earth?
No, that's not what I meant.
What, then?
I'm saying that the camera's rolling!
Idiot!
Turn it off!
Isono!
Isono!
What is it, Nakajima?!

Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
I'm Soujirou.
I'm Kanata.
Then Sou-kun...
I'll be heading off now.
Are you leaving?
Take me with you.
I don't know how to leave my body yet...
...but I'm sure I can learn!
Sou-kun, you're talking about manga or anime again, aren't you?
Then see you later.
Kanata!
Next time:

Konata.
Can I use your computer?
I want to type up something...
...for the meeting next week.
Sure.
Let's see...
I've been having difficulties lately...

Hey.
Can we talk about your PC for a sec?
It's hard to use other people's computers, Kagami.
A
Fine
Line
I didn't check my inbox for two or three days...
...and now it's mega full!
You don't look like someone who'd get a lot of mail.
Cousin Yui...
Doesn't even bat an eye...
Of course I get mail.
Maybe it's 'cause I visit all the right sites...
...but over 90% of these are junk or spam.
It's hard for me to respond...
...so don't admit those things to a cop, okay?
Still, I've been thinking...
It's impressive how they can come up with all these interesting titles.
That's true.
Preparing to copy files
Copying from "Tsundere" to "Images"
2 Hours remaining
90 Minutes remaining
58 Minutes remaining
It's going pretty fast.
Maybe it'll finish sooner than expected.

The way it goes up and down makes it useless!
Guess I'll have a cup of ramen for a snack.
Played me like a fool...
Hello.
Welcome.
I heard Konata and Yutaka are sick?
Whew...
You okay, Yutaka?
This hasn't happened in a while.
Yo, Konata!
You ok—
Cousin Yui.
Welcome!
You don't have the strength to go to class...
...but you have enough to play games.
Well...
You know...
You should understand, Cousin Yui.
Hello!
Minami and friends.
You came to visit.
Thanks!
She's stuck in bed...
...but this is the first time she's had so much energy.
I really appreciate it, Minami-chan.
No.
I didn't do anything...
She had some close friends back in middle school...
Maybe you two just have good chemistry.
She's always talking about you.
She must be having so much fun at school.
You know how they say that sickness comes from the mind.
And it looks like people forget they're sick when they're having fun.
Hello!
Minami and friends.
You came to visit.
Thanks!
She's stuck in bed...
...but this is the first time she's had so much energy.
I really appreciate it, Minami-chan.
No.
I didn't do anything...
She had some close friends back in middle school...
Maybe you two just have good chemistry.
She's always talking about you.
She must be having so much fun at school.
Minami-chan, Tamura-san, and Patty-chan.
Welcome.
Are you okay?
Get well soon!
But...
I wonder why I'm so weak...
I don't like how I make other people worry.
Nah.
That ends up making people want to protect you.
Well, it may sound good in theory...
...but it's usually hard on the person.
You could say that...
...it's like how people who actually have little sisters...
...don't feel the charm of little sisters.
That's it!
Here it comes!
The normal folks are shunning us!
So this is the "no idea what you're talking about" aura!
It can't be helped!
We're outlaws!
Speaking of weaknesses...
...you're sensitive about how you have no breasts, right, Minami-chan?
Really?
U-Um, well...
They say that they get bigger if you massage them, right?
I've heard about that.
I-Is it really okay...
...Minami-chan?
You're the only one...
...I can ask to do this...
I-I'm going to touch you...
Control yourself...
Control yourself, girl!
So you're a member of that circle.
Yes.
I participated in the last Summer Comiket.
I have a few of your books.
Man...
That's very kind of you.
Really.
I want to see the manga you draw, Tamura-san.
Let me read some, Big Sister.
Sure thi—
I-I don't think that's...
Nah, Hiyorin.
Doujin works are meant to be seen.
Please have mercy!
Not to the normal people!
That's bad manners, Hiyorin.
Anyone but them!
That's incredible.
Then let's go over the answers.
Xylitol gum...
Yes.
Has the ability to reduce cavities.
That's because...
When Xylitol...
...is absorbed by bacteria...
...the bacteria's...
...ATP...
...is depleted and at the same time...
...the bacteria in the cavity...
...is broken down.
If they're so good for your teeth...
...I'll give it a try.
I was chewing gum to help my teeth...
...and a filling fell out.
Now I have to visit the dentist...
The assiduous, yet slightly unlucky Miyuki-san is so moe.
There, there.
And so...
...Miyuki-san was crying today.
It was so moe.
R-Really...
That's what Big Sister said.
So that's why Miyuki-san looked so down.
I feel bad for this Miyuki-san...
...but I'm going to use that material!
Well...
I haven't been able to come up with ideas...
How do you come up with ideas for manga?
There really isn't a single method to it...
...but I use a lot of stuff from personal experience.
P-Personal experience...?
You read them, didn't you?!
Um, well...
You read them, didn't you?!
Well...
After I begged her not to show you...
S-Sorry...
Those aren't based on personal experience...
B-But there were a lot of good stories...
...that I really enjoyed.
Thanks...
I think it's called déjà vu.
I felt like I'd experienced some parts.
I would also like to read them.
Sorry!
So sorry...
That was probably the one based on you two...
Teacher, good morning.
What's wrong, Izumi?
Up all night playing games again?
Or watching late-night anime?
Man...
They sure air a lot more late-night anime these days.
Great time to be alive...
Can't you just lie and say you were studying?
Really...
I was considering splurging on a DVD recorder or something.
Nah.
Don't do it.
You'll never get around to watching it.
Like how games pile up, huh?
What are you talking about?!
Hey!
Cut that out!
That's not funny!
Just so you know...
...it's none of my business what happens!
Hello?
You didn't hang up just now, did you?
Well...
I had three bars, but I still got cut off...
Well, I guess I was a little immature there.
Sorry.
It's not like I hung up on you.
Machida Dentistry
I've returned to this place again...
Okay...
Let's see which one fell out.
We can just stick it back in.
It'll be over soon.
But you've got another cavity developing in the back...
...so let's start treating that.
What's wrong?
I just realized that...
...strawberries smell like shortcake!
Er, don't you mean shortcake smells like strawberries?
Since it has strawberries inside.
H-H-Huh?
Well...
People mix stuff up like that every now and then.
Uncle.
Big Sister.
Good morning!
Yu-chan, good morning!
Today's Bow-Wow.
So many animals!
They're doing a special on pets.
First, we have...
...a Welsh corgi, Ku-chan.
It's a corgi!
So cute!
The owner's not too bad either.
She scores high for the thigh-highs.
And she has a nicely balanced absolute territory.
She'd look good in a gothic maid outfit.
Next, we have the Siberian husky, Silviana-chan.
It's a husky!
You don't see many of them these days.
I really like them.
This girl's gotta be a tsundere!
So moe.
Every girl with pigtails looks like a tsundere.
So you also play games, Kusakabe.
I like them, but I suck.
Wanna play a bit?
You're good, Hiiragi.
Wow!
Whoa, what was that?
Look!
Isn't Hiiragi amazing?
She really is.
Is this for real?!
When I see how much fun she's having...
Out of my league!
...I feel like a loser for caring so much about winning.
Total classic, right?
You go for the stink, huh?
Patricia-san.
Hello.
You've been visiting a lot recently.
Patty's a studious foreign student.
Which is why I've been teaching her
about the soul of Japanese culture every day.
The stuff you teach her...
...is only a tiny fraction of Japanese culture.
Otakus are the pride of Japanese culture!
My critical mission is...
...to absorb as much as I can...
...and take it back to America!
That's right!
I admire your passion...
Say, Patricia-san...
What kind of music do you listen to?
Let's see...
Orange Ran**.
Chemis***.
Suneoha**.
Porno Graffi**.
L'Arc~en~Ci**.
*inn.
Night****.
And many others.
I'm listening to many different Japanese artists!
That's a surprise.
But you know...
They all did anime songs, right?
Man.
You're so sharp, Konata.
And you only listen to their anime songs, right?
I'd like a maid.
A maid.
A maid, huh?
You live by yourself instead of in a dorm?
Yes.
I'm so busy with cooking, cleaning, manga, and anime!
I guess it'd be hard if you're not used to it...
You'd want to hire a housekeeper.
No, no.
Not a housekeeper.
A maid.
Aren't they the same thing?
Geez!
They're totally different!
What do they teach you in this country?!
Um...
Isn't your impression of Japan a little off?
I-I can't let you have this.
It's fried.
He won't give up because he knows you're soft.
It's hopeless.
Come here, I'll give you this.
Eat slowly now.
But now I feel a little lonely.
The class thinks that she's quiet and scary...
...but she's really kind, calm, and cool!
She's really admired by Kobayakawa-san, a relative of Izumi-san.
My...
Is that so?
Minami-chan!
Circular notice!
Minami-chan is calm and cool, huh?
Which reminds me...
Izumi-san also said...
She looks all cool and flawless...
...but when you see her with
Yu-chan, you can tell she's a good person.
That's what she said.
I'm sorry.
This is on sale...
...so it's limited to one per customer.
My...
Minami-chan is cool and flawless.
Also...
Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san...
Minami-chan looks like she can do everything quickly to perfection.
Minami-chan looks like...
...she could do anything.
I admire how she's so cool!
Minami-san...
...is also admired by...
...Kagami-san and Tsukasa-san.
Mom?
The item you wanted is limited to one per customer.
Oh?
Oh?
Oh?
Oh...
Minami-chan does everything quickly to perfection...
Yo!
Yo!
Welcome!
What'cha watching?
A mecha anime I rented.
Sure looks cool.
You still like this stuff, huh?
I'm not really interested in mecha.
You're not interested in mecha?
So why are you watching?
In order to grab a wider audience...
...recent mecha anime almost always...
...features a cute boy or girl.
Can you really call that a mecha anime?
Okay?
Hiiragi?
Got it?
It's a promise!
I'm counting on you tomorrow!
Yeah, yeah.
I'll take care of it.
Come on, Misa-chan.
Hiiragi-chan said okay.
You shouldn't keep bothering her.
But based on past experience...
People who say they'll take care of it never intend to.
Bah.
She's sharp about the oddest things...
Kagami-sama!
Let's stop by Gamers on the way home!
I don't need to buy anything...
..and I have something to do, so I'll pass.
C'mon...
Just for a bit...
No!
C'mon...
Don't play with my hair.
Besides...
You have bookstores in your town, don't you?
You know how once you've gone to a specialty store...
...a normal bookstore feels lacking in some way?
They might not have everything you want.
That's 'cause the stuff you want is too unique.
So?
What are you getting?
I'm getting this today!
You sure watch a lot of stuff...
I haven't watched the anime.
But the second I saw this cover...
...I felt a connection somehow.
It's been on my mind for a while.
I don't get it.
But you know...
I finally understand the concept of buying albums for their cover.
You know?
You choose light novels based on their cover, right?
Well, I can't deny it...
When it turns out to be good...
...you feel like you got a great deal.
And if it's not good...
...you don't regret it since you just bought it on a whim.
In other words...
...a once-in-a-lifetime encounter!
You might think that you're making sense there...
...but that's a stretch.
Let's take it easy.
Is this another once-in-a-lifetime encounter?
That was grandiose.
Cover your face.
Well...
You can't really control when you sneeze.
This is the first time I've heard
someone actually go "achoo" when they sneeze.
For some reason...
There's a world of difference between us after one sneeze...
No fair!
It's no fair how cute your sneeze is!
Don't tease her.
After a round, it actually smells good now.
But it's already over.
You two sure are close.
Do you guys ever fight?
Sure have!
Believe it or not...
...Ayano's really scary when she's mad.
It's true that some people are like that!
Geez...
Even Hiiragi-chan says so...
By the way...
You're always scary, Hiiragi.
So that's...
...my position in life?
Minami-chan runs the same time as you in the 100-meter dash.
Really...
But...
I bet if we actually raced...
...I'd win by the difference in our chests!
As if!
Smo――――oth
Fl――――at
Smooth and Flat Girls
W-Wouldn't Minami-chan win because of her height?
Flat chest...
Everyone just ignored that, huh?
Don't you agree, Hiiragi?
Isn't it fun, Hiiragi?
What do you think, Hiiragi?
Misa-chan's "don't respond to everything so dully"...
...and Hiiragi-chan's "don't talk to me when I'm reading" attitudes...
...are really electrifying the air.
Man...
The characters in Japanese anime and games are really moe.
Yep.
Huh?
Isn't this image bugged?
That's okay.
This is how it's supposed to look.
But it's still pretty naughty...
What kind of game are you playing there, high schoolers?
What are you all doing?
Yu-chan doesn't need to know!
It's done.
I haven't written a long blog entry in a while.
And submit...
This page cannot be displayed
B-Back!
Back!
Warning: Page has expired
Hey there!
I'm not gonna read you The Riot Act...
Depressed.
It doesn't matter what's happened...
The two of you...
You know?
Worked together to build this corner up from nothing, right?
And look at this.
Why destroy it all at the end?
Disappointed.
I've done some things to make people call me dark and gloomy...
...but I've never had to mediate a pathetic fight like this!
Understand?
If we don't resolve this immediately, boys and girls...
...it's gonna make me look bad, too.
Yeah, Shiraishi?
I-I'm terribly sorry.
Gotouther-sama.
What do you think, Akira?
I'm sorry, Goto—
I'm sorry, Gotouther-sama!
In that case...
Why don't you just kiss and make up?
Okay?
One more episode.
Why don't you find your original
conviction and finish Lucky Channel?
Well?
How does that sound?
Underst—
Louder!
Understood!
Okay.
That's that.
I'll let you two handle the rest.
Do your best to survive in the anime industry.
Then I'll go home first.
I'll talk to the producer.
Call me if anything else happens.
I could lend you some help, if you want.
Next Episode
Well, next time on Lucky Star:
Shut up already!
Hey, people!
Can't you do a proper job on the last one?!
Are you listening?
Hey!
Forget it.
I'll do it myself!
Next time:
「TBA」
TBA.
Wait, what? They didn't name it yet?!
Outou Festival
Opening Ceremony
Accepting Proposals
A cultural festival, huh?
Guess it's that time of year.
We have tests coming up.
It's such a pain how we have to do so much in second semester.
That's all you have to say...
...heading into our last cultural festival of high school?
Opening ceremony?
What's this?
Every year...
...during the Outou Festival...
...groups of people perform at the beginning of the day.
I just had a great idea!
TBA
Bazaar
Maze
Fortune Telling House
Tooth-brushing
Exercising
Now then...
Our class has decided...
...to host a fortune telling house for the festival...
...so please come up with your own method of fortune telling...
...before our next homeroom.
Tooth-brushing Exercising
The History of and How to Make Paulownia Cabinets
Haunted House
You worked hard!
I was touched!
And so...
I'm thinking about doing a cheerleading routine!
Cheerleading?
For the opening ceremony we talked about this morning.
It would be the best performance to pump up the festival.
It does sound flashy and fun.
Doesn't it?
We'll be the talk of the town!
B-By "we" you mean...
We're part of it?
I asked the teacher...
...and was told that the plan must be
properly developed, which requires members.
Wh-What about you, Yutaka?
M-Me?
It might be physically hard on Yu-chan.
Maybe I should give it a try.
I guess I might try if it isn't any trouble...
Trouble?
Absolutely not!
You're very welcome!
W-Will you be okay?
It'll probably be hard...
...so I might just hold everyone back...
...but I'd like to give it a try this time.
There!
Yutaka's willing to do it.
What do you two say?
In that case...
Well, if everyone's doing it...
I have wonderful friends!
Fortune telling, huh?
But do you even know how to tell fortunes?
Not a clue.
Oh my...
Hey!
Wasn't it your idea?
You can just wing it when it's for a cultural festival.
That's right...
What's your class doing, Sis?
Well...
We're being generic and going the haunted house route.
A classic, huh?
We couldn't come up with any other fun ideas.
Something wrong?
Nah.
I just thought it was very appropriate...
What are you trying to say?!
The real-life demon's angry!
Knew you would say that...
And so...
Patty-chan said she wanted to do cheerleading.
So...
I thought I might work hard at it.
Why?
I'm always absent...
...so I never accomplished anything with other people.
But I'm feeling better these days.
What I've been wanting to do...
...and what Patty-chan wants to do right now...
...might be the same thing, you know?
But it'll be pretty rough...
And...
We don't have enough people...
...so Patty-chan was wondering if you could participate.
So that's how it goes...
You're good at sports...
If people like you and Minami-chan are there...
...I might be able to hang in there to the end.
I can tell that you're really serious about
this, and Patty's also asking me for help...
Yes?
Hello?
Good evening!
Konata!
It's Patty, huh?
I just heard about your idea and was thinking it over...
Time for a quiz!
I'm holding a certain ticket in my hand right now.
Well...
What do you think the ticket is for?
C-Could it be...
Konata.
You loved the Jam, didn't you?
Don't you want to exchange a hot handshake with Haruhi?
Handshake session!
I wanna go! I wanna go!
Aya in the flesh!
By the way, Konata...
...weren't you about to say something?
Yu-chan.
Let's work hard to make some memories!
Which means...
This is the age of cheerleading, girls.
What kind of reasoning is that?
Patty came up with the idea of doing a cheerleading
routine during the cultural festival's opening ceremony.
Sounds fitting enough.
Which is why the two of you will also be dancing.
Are there any other people in your class who can dance, Kagami?
H-Hold it right there!
Don't just go on ahead without our permission!
I-I probably can't do that stuff...
But we probably won't get another chance like this.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
We'll be doing it with people we know.
Plus, it's a festival.
It's more fun if we go crazy with everyone.
Really?
You might be right!
You're so easily convinced...
I refuse.
I have to prepare for my class project.
I just wanted to make some memories
during our last cultural festival together...
You always bring up friendship out of nowhere!
It's obviously an act!
Yu-chan's really pumped up about this.
But will she be okay?
I told her she shouldn't do it...
But she was really earnest about
wanting to accomplish something with everyone.
R-Really...
But you know...
She said that they don't have enough people.
That's how I got involved.
I guess I was a little forceful about it.
I shouldn't push people into this.
I'll just ask someone else.
Fine...
What?
Fine!
I'll do it!
Sis!
Really?
I can't help it.
My class can just replace me with someone else...
...but you guys can't do that.
Kagami sure is cute.
Ch-Cheerleading, is it?
I'm not confident I'd do a good job...
Well...
We're not too sure about a lot of things right now...
Especially in terms of volume.
I'd feel a lot better if you joined us!
Is that so?
I understand.
If I can be of help...
Thanks, Boin—
I mean, Miyuki-san...
Testing is over...
...so we'll be focusing on preparations for the cultural festival...
...but don't get too relaxed!
Honestly...
They could cut down on testing when we have school events...
Yo!
Hey, Konata.
What's going on with the cheerleading thing?
That reminds me...
Before testing started...
"They approved the plan!"
...is what I heard...
But I haven't heard anything since.
What?!
How irresponsible!
We're not gonna have enough time to practice at this rate...
Or actually...
It's already too late!
Guess we'll go ask.
Sorry!
I haven't worked out the choreography yet!
Haven't worked out the choreography?
What are we supposed to do then?!
It's also taking time to pick a song.
It's not easy to find something on Hare Hare Yukai's level.
What was that?
Anyway...
If you were having trouble...
...you should have asked other people for help.
This was your idea...
...so you need to be responsible for scheduling!
So many difficult Japanese words I don't know!
How can you say that when
you've done perfectly fine up until now?!
At least get some of the choreography done today!
We'll work out the kinks as we practice!
Ask someone who's free if you can't figure something out!
Miyuki and I can handle general
scheduling and reserving a practice location!
We're counting on you!
Kagami...
You were pretty against this idea...
...but like...
...you're the most passionate one here.
Be quiet!
What are you going to do, Miyuki-san?
I'll be using tarot cards.
And what about you, Tsukasa?
I haven't decided yet...
Yuki-chan.
Is there something even I could do?
Let's see...
How about one that involves reading shapes?
Th-This shape...
...means that your love fortune is good...
...m-most likely!
Tsukasa.
You just made that up, didn't you?
Y-Ya think so?
W-Wait a second!
You want us to learn this?!
It's no good?
It's not an issue of quality...
It looks fairly difficult.
We don't have much time.
Shouldn't we just simplify the harder parts as we go?
Oh my...
But if we get through this...
...a wonderful feeling of satisfaction awaits us!
You shouldn't be saying that!
We're out of tape.
It can't be helped.
I'll make a trip to the store.
Then grab magic markers while you're at it.
And some exacto refills.
Cardboard!
Playboy.
Glue.
Something weird got mixed up in there...
And if we need to buy so much stuff...
...stop playing around and go buy it!
What are we calling the yakisoba?
A Fragrant Breath of Spring.
What's this Fallen Drop of Sunlight?
That's okonomiyaki.
Man...
You can't tell what's what on this menu!
Japanese culture is so fun.
This project seems to be abusing stereotypes...
Hey!
What are you guys doing?
Um...
A-A Zuka cafe.
1-D Cutou Festival Project
ZUKA CAFE
「WIND TROUBLE」
Wh-Wh—
What is this?
Basically...
It's a cafe where you can enjoy shows in the spirit of Zuka.
With girls in shiny dresses...
...and beautiful girls in male clothing...
...serving as waitresses.
Two for one!
Male clothing...?
That's right!
Yu-chan and Minami-chan are the leads!
In their dazzling, beautiful world!
When was this decided...?
I'm also worried about the cheerleading...
...but is this going to work?
Those two are something else.
You're very good, Minami-san.
Then let's try it again.
They sure are.
And they're perfectly in rhythm.
Okay!
By the way...
Would that be considered sadistic on the part of Miyuki-san...
...or masochistic on the part of Minami-chan?
When you put it that way...
Takara-senpai's dynamic dance moves...
...are probably putting pressure on Minami-chan.
Ya think so?
Just forget that and practice.
The cheerleading costumes are complete!
It looks great!
It looks wonderful...
...but it's a bit embarrassing.
These kinds of costumes make the people watching happier.
In fact...
...this outfit was chosen by one of those who like to watch.
The one you mentioned last time...
The dreadful, older Tamura brother.
You can expect some great Zuka costumes, too!
That's right...
You guys are doing a cheerleading routine, right?
Can I take pictures?!
Within reasonable limits.
I'll be careful...
Well...
We haven't done it successfully yet...
...so we're pretty worried.
I'll use my power to charge you up...
...so work hard!
Your power...
...might charge us up so much we tire ourselves out.
Basically like that.
It's pretty rough considering how we have no time left.
A cultural festival, huh?
What did we do for ours?
We had what you now call...
...you know...
...a manga cafe.
All the boys in our class...
...brought in their manga.
So you guys were ahead of your time.
It may seem normal to bring manga nowadays...
...but back when we were in school, they were strict about it.
You could only do it during festivals.
Well, people bring it to school...
...but it's not really approved...
A fortune telling house, is it?
Let everyone know...
...to give me a good fortune if I come.
B-But that wouldn't be fortune telling...
By the way...
How was it when you were in school?
I think each class or club had their own project.
The projects were stuff like haunted houses...
...and okonomiyaki vendors.
Pretty standard stuff.
It's rather strange how...
...it doesn't seem much has changed.
By the way...
...was a study of a cultural item such as Paulownia cabinets...
...ever used as a project?
What's that?
That wouldn't be any fun at all, now would it?
You're right...
Absolutely right...
Okay!
Time for a break!
It looks like we can pull off an exciting performance.
Well...
It's not complete yet...
...so hang in there to the very end.
This is when...
...it's a big help to have Hiiragi here to take command.
Well...
I don't want to be the only one left out of the memory.
Wh-What is it?!
Don't stare at me!
Sixteenth
Outou Festival
Now is your time to shine...
My...
Is that so?
I'm terribly sorry about that.
No trouble at all.
It appears that today's a rehearsal...
...and only students are allowed.
So?
We, the general public...
...can't get in until tomorrow.
That's why I told you to check before coming here!
But...
I heard that Akira-chan would be here today.
Geez!
What a waste of train fare!
16th Outou Festival
Open to Students 11/**
Open to General Public 11/**
If we still had that money...
...we could have had hamburger steak or something fancy!
Yeah...
I really dig this feeling of incompleteness.
Leave us alone.
And, like...
...you're walking around in that?
This serves as advertising.
Your costume's cute, Kona-chan!
Gotta start from the appearance.
I'll read lots of fortunes today!
In five minutes and fifteen
seconds, you will buy soft-serve ice cream...
In five minutes and twenty-eight
seconds, you will drop it on your leg.
It seven minutes and six seconds, you will hit your head on a sign.
Fortune telling doesn't mean to predict the future.
Word for word?!
You guys look great.
But...
...we're just as good!
It took till the very last second...
...but we're finally done!
So cute!
You look wonderful.
It's really embarrassing to walk around in this costume...
That's some outfit...
Oh, but it's cute.
Senpai.
Akira Kogami's about to go on stage.
Really...
I'll be right there.
Nice to meet you, Teacher.
I'm Akira Kogami!
I'll work hard today!
I'm...
...Sakuraba.
Today's like a rehearsal...
...so we'll just be running some check-ups...
Countin' on you.
Hey, Shiraishi.
You handle the rest.
Yes.
I'm the cultural festival planning committee chair, Shiraishi.
It's a pleasure.
I'm letting Shiraishi handle the rest...
...so let him know if you need something.
Please.
Okay!
Hey, you.
Say something.
You should have gone to the demon council.
Is something wrong?
No, nothing's wrong!
We were going through things...
...and got a little too excited!
Anyway...
You're an appreciated guest...
...so we'll treat you accordingly.
So?
After this...
...we'll need a mic check for Cape of Thirty Years on Lucky Channel.
Feel free to say whatever you
want after the song onstage tomorrow.
Well, I'll do a good job of it.
Then...
Please head to the stage.
Damn Shiraishi...
Lucky Channel
Weak...
Good lucky!
Thank you for coming to see Akira, everyone!
I hope you have lots of fun today!
She longs to be in the arms of her beloved...
Will such a day ever come?
As she drifts alone...
...guided by his words from that day...
She'll go anywhere in search of a trace...
Here's a song.
Akira Kogami-san with...
Cape of Thirty Years.
Would you mi—
Okay, that's enough!
Goddamn it!
Let me sing my song!
I told you it was just a check!
We don't have time!
Like I give a damn!
I'm going to kill you, bastard!
So many difficult Japanese words I don't know!
Is everybody ready?
This is the last run-through.
I came up with this idea a little spontaneously...
...but the fact that I've been given a
chance to do something with everyone...
...makes me really happy.
Instead of worrying about success or failure...
...I just think we should have fun!

We did it!
It's like, oh my.
Ya think so?
What's this?
You're still here?
We were practicing our cheerleading routine.
Really.
So how's it going?
Can't wait to see it.
Teacher!
I'm thirsty!
Guess it's okay.
I suppose I can buy drinks for hardworking young people.
Lucky!
Is it really okay?
Sure thing.
This is a special case, though.
In return...
...be sure to make the first event at the festival...
...a real blast!
Okay!
What's up, Tsukasa?
How should I put it...
It kinda feels strange.
That's right.
Actually...
...I'm also feeling a bit melancholic.
They say you have the most fun when preparing for a festival.
That's right...
Tomorrow's the real thing.
That's right.
We may never stay at school so late again.
You feel a bit lonely when you look at it that way.
Ta-Tamura-san...
Your face is really strained.
Yeah...
Like...
My stomach hurts...
Tsukasa...
You're frozen stiff, aren't you?
You don't look so calm yourself.
B-Being nervous helps you concentrate!
I think I'm so nervous I can't move.
Test. Test.
Then we will now begin the Outou Festival!
The first performance today...
...was submitted by a foreign student, Patricia-san.
A cheerleading routine performed by a group of friends.
Then let's begin...
U-Uh, sorry.
Cell phones should...
It's mine!
Crap!
Running into trouble at the very end!
That relaxed me so much I almost fell!
Great timing!
Wasn't that guy so lame?
They say that trouble tends to follow people around.
Well, I guess this is appropriate for us.
How we can never be serious, huh?
Okay, well...
Y'know...
Yes!
Sorry about that!
I'm really sorry!
Okay!
Then let's try that again!
Take it! Sailor Uniform!
Your whimsical nature is acting up again.
I'm so sad. Put an end to it.
You're probably dreaming about her again.
With a sigh...
So long in my dream...
She is an Angel.
(NO!) She is a Devil.
As far as you're concerned...
...she's a girl who set a sweet trap for you.
Your love is paradise.
Repeating over and over but now it's gone.
I love you.
Within my lips...
Maybe, just maybe...
Maybe love is...
...a boomerang we throw.
Maybe, just maybe...
Maybe love is...
...a boomerang we throw.
Ah, Cherry...
Good morning.
Good morning...
Good morning...
Everyone's coming over today...
So be a good girl, okay?
Hello.
Coming...
Hello, Miyuki-san.
I baked some cookies yesterday.
I thought I'd bring some over for you to try, Minami-san.
Hello, Cherry-chan.
Would you like to try some too?
H-Hey, Cherry!
What are you doing?
Well, dogs sometimes tend to do that.
Ah...
Would it be alright if I gave her a cookie?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure she would be happy to have one.
Here.
She went to bury it.
She didn't eat it, did she?
Ah, it's Cherry-chan!
Her nose is all black!
Huh, that's strange...
Where did it go?
My cell phone...
Cherry-chan...
You didn't bury it, did you?
C'mon...
Keep on looking around.
R-Right!
You sure have a dirty face...
You always seem to have it easy...
Meanwhile, Tsukasa loses her phone...
Konata is way late...
She didn't even bother to call us, as usual.
Ah, geez!
No, because I am.
A Scorpio woman.
I'll laugh heartily.
Until I'm satisfied.
Hello!
Hello, Cherry!
Your paws are so hard...
Not comforting at all!
These paws aren't squishy like they are in manga...
I am in despair!
No reaction whatsoever.
Cherry, stupid dog.
There are times when even if call her, she won't wake up.
Also, she's not stupid.
Cherry, you stupid dog.
Cherry, you lazy bum.
L-Lazy bum?
Cherry...
You fat dog.
Drooling dog.
Stupid dog.
Lazy bum.
Oh!
At least she's aware.
A stupid dog like yourself that sleeps all day...
...deserves to be called a lazy bum!
Whenever I try, no matter what I do...
...she never wakes up.
Ah, she's sleeping right here.
Hello.
It's been a while, hasn't it?
Hello.
Hello.
You're such a cute and quiet dog, aren't you?
Thank you, thank you.
Cherry-chan, you're so cute!
Cherry-chan, you're so cute!
What are you doing?
C-Cherry-chan was being so quiet...
...so, I couldn't resist...
But to have a huge dog like this lying in the hallway...
This house sure is laid-back.
Well, she's so quiet.
Just looking at her makes me feel at ease.
I have a dog at home too, so I totally know what you mean.
Anyway, didn't you need to use the restroom?
Oh, right!
Excuse me for a bit.
So relaxing.
What-!?
You're so quiet around the others...
Why are you suddenly reacting to me?
Slowly...
Oh...
You're a good girl today, aren't you?
Okay, shake.
Not gonna do it, huh?
You're Minami-chan's dog, so I thought you would be a bit smarter...
Oh, I know!
Wait, wait!
Sit, girl!
Sit!!
What an honest dog...
Well, then...
Shake!
H-Hey!
Lay off!
Please stop...
Here.
I don't understand big dogs at all...
What the-!?
D-Don't spit it out!
Minami, dinner time!
Mom, Cherry's not eating her dinner.
Seems like it...
I even put in some of the canned food you got for her.
But she still won't eat it...
I thought she liked that stuff.
Cherry...
Cheer up.
We're all worried about you.
What happened to your face?
What were you digging up?
Oh, I get it...
You were eating the stuff you buried?
That's fine...
As long as you're happy, Cherry...
That's all I need.
Still, that was pretty sudden.
Why did you start playing online games, Hiiragi?
Eh?
Sensei, believe it or not...
Kagami is a big fan of the artist who worked on the anime adaptation for this game.
Seriously?
So you've finally given into the dark side, huh?
Konata!
Don't say unnecessary things!
Huh?
But if you want to copy the anime, then aren't the Hiiragi sisters a mis-casting?
It should be the reverse.
Ouch!
Konata!
Kagami, thx!
Nothing to it.
Sensei...
For the sake of our own survival...
...swapping them would be a fatal mistake.
I see what you mean...
I feel a lot safer this way.
Hey, Konata...
I have a feeling the jobs we have in the game...
...and the ones that are in the anime are different...
Oh, those are higher level jobs.
We have to transfer professions from our current jobs to get those done.
How do you switch jobs?
Coming soon.
Huh?
Well, it happens all the time.
They claim that the anime and game will progress concurrently...
...but once the anime finishes airing, it's all "coming soon."
But when you're in a game world like this, you start getting immersed.
And you really do get reminded of those game-based anime.
Oh yeah, like the one they set up to look like an online game but was actually offline.
I wonder why they didn't release that online.
I honestly believed that it was an online game, and I went looking for it all over the place.
That does seem to happen often.
Tsukasa, just hit ENTER.
Ah.
Aah, aah...
Yay, I can finally talk!
I was wondering why you weren't talking...
If you don't hit ENTER, you won't talk.
Man, it's so nice forming parties with people you know.
You're so right.
Pick-up groups are hit or miss, so it's a gamble every time.
What do you guys usually do, Kona-chan?
Just start spamming for groups or form one myself.
Then again, there are lots of times when no one picks me up.
If you miss the prime time for groups, then you end up playing solo the whole night.
'Cause no one ever wants to be the party leader.
And everyone just looks for groups.
Not to mention there are lots of times where you get too many of the same class.
And if you form a group in a rush, you could end up wasting even more time wiping.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about!
Tsukasa, your spells never do much damage, do they?
That's weird...
Mages are supposed to be strong enough to solo-farm.
Where are you putting your stats?
Stats?
Eh!?
B-But normally in games...
...when you level up, you just automatically learn spells.
So, I thought this was just like that...
Indeed...
Here it is!
Now that I'm level 10, I can attack twice!
If I keep leveling up, I wonder if I can pull off three attacks...
Hmm...
What is this feeling of déjà vu...?
It feels very much like I'm playing a Lodoss tabletalk RPG...
More nonsense...
This game's got a lot of emotes.
Sensei, we should make a victory pose for our party!
Was that really necessary?
Yes, yes it was, Kagami. Especially since we're online.
This floor has 3 enemies and a hidden treasure.
For this boss, I'll pull him away and kite him, so you guys DPS him from behind.
He's weak to fire, so make sure you take advantage of that.
If you talk to that guy over there, he'll give you a quest.
Next, you just talk to the old man by the exit and you'll get some cash.
Kona-chan, you know so much.
Lately, all that information is floating around the net.
There are some amazing sites that'll have a complete walkthrough uploaded the same day.
It's almost as though they're getting paid for it.
If only they could redirect all that energy into fueling society...
...and make themselves useful.
This is invincible Pizza-La Shield, there's nothing to fear!
P-Pizza-La?
It's an in-game promotional item.
If you order a pizza, you can get such special items.
Why do I feel like you're falling into their trap?
Man...
Even though I'm aware of it, I still do it for some reason.
You too!?
Eh?
A trip?
We're going to the hot springs as a family.
So I don't think we'll be on during Golden Week.
Oh, I'm going somewhere with Yu-chan, too.
I hope it won't be too crowded...
After Golden Week
Sensei...
Don't tell me...
And so, what did this kid do after that?
This is the right answer.
Eh?
Yes, Mayumi-chan.
Then we're off to go see the ball.
Watch over the house, okay?
Okay.
Kagami, you're really not going to go?
Yeah, it's too much trouble anyway.
Are you sure?
You're going to miss out on this chance.
I'm starting to get a bit nervous.
Tsukasa, why don't you try participating?
Eh?
T-That's impossible!
We're off.
Make sure to lock up, okay?
Okay, okay.
Take care.
Still, this wife is pretty scary.
Do you think so?
Something like this is normal, right?
She didn't think so at all!
I shall make that wish of yours come true!
Where did you come from?
And what's with that getup?
Now, now...
By the way, my current designation is a mage.
What do you mean, "designation?"
Oh, is that so...?
Your evil stepmother and sisters are picking on you, huh?
Huh?
What's this?
You want to go to the ball too?
No, I said nothing of the sort.
In other words...
You're the fairy godmother, and I'm Cinderella...
...and now I must get on a carriage and go attend the ball?
That's correct.
Which is why....
That's not even a carriage!
Don't worry about the details, Kagami.
Okay, let's head out!
Kagami, you get on as well.
No.
Geez...
Do you really want to have a carriage that much?
No!
I don't even know what the hell you're talking about!
And I never intended to go to the ball in the first place.
Now, now...
Don't talk like you know it all.
Anyway...
I'm not going, got it?
For sure?
For sure!
No matter what?
Enough!
Geez...
What was she thinking?
Ah!
I forgot to have her turn that back to normal.
Whoa!
A-An earthquake?
Whoa!
W-What the hell is this?!
Oh, Kagami...
I wouldn't go outside right now if I were you.
Is this your doing?
Yup.
Stop it already!
But you refused to leave the house...
I told you that I don't want to go, didn't I?
Then I'll just go to the dance hall like this.
Okay, fine!
I'll go, now stop all of this!
Aren't you looking forward to the ball, Kagami?
Not at all.
I bet the truth is that you're really happy.
You tsundere, you.
Stop calling me a tsundere!
Besides, why is a fairy godmother such as yourself coming along too?
Oh, yeah...
We should take this opportunity to get you all dressed up.
Hey, are you even listening to me?
Here.
I guess this is the default selection.
Hey, this isn't something you'd wear to a ball!
No, no...
I think you're more than qualified for that type of niche, Kagami.
What are you talking about?
Anyways, change my clothes back!
Huh, after I went through all that trouble?
I never asked you to!
Change it back right now!
Okay...
Hey, you didn't fix anything!
I guess you could call this another type of "default".
Besides, this is your usual cosplay.
Don't call it cosplay!
Somebody's gonna get hurt real soon...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
I'll do it right this time.
Ah.
It fell off...
Huh?
Sorry, but it looks like I can't change your clothes back to normal.
We're here!
Fighters' ball in Saitama: Love is touch and endless.
How 'bout this?
Winner, Kuroi Nanako!
All right!
Today, I will escape from my life as a bachelorette!
You just wait for me, Prince Misao!
Okay!
Win, win, and keep on winning!
Whoever wins this competition...
Will be my bride!
They're really getting into it...
Whatever, I don't care.
Oh, Hiiragi-chan!
I knew you would come after all!
Love.
Be quiet.
Don't touch me.
Did you dress up like this just for me?
No.
Hiiragi, you're participating too, right?
Not a chance.
C'mon, just participate.
I'll fix all your matches.
Then why even have a competition?
First of all, I don't want to participate...
...and second, I don't want to become your bride!
What is this, Hiiragi...?
You're being pretty cold...
Don't worry, prince, this is just her "tsun" side.
Oh, which means deep down...
No!!
Geez...
I know this was going to happen, which is why I didn't want to go!
Anyways, I'm going home now.
Eh?
You're leaving already?
When the clock strikes midnight, all the magic will be undone anyways, right?
If I don't leave now, the car will disappear.
How did she know?
Who cares, who cares?!
Let's play!
It's time for the fight predictions!
Are you a little kid?
Hey, Konata.
The house is still displaced!
Can't you move it back to its original location?
I fixed the Starring Inferno, so everything should be okay!
Why do I not feel reassured?
Is it really okay?
Eh?
I guess time's up.
No way!
It's already past midnight?
What about the house?
I guess it'll have to stay like this.
Stay like this?
Can't you do something with your magic?
Actually, I was also on the receiving side of a magic spell...
Which is why I can't do anything past 12AM.
What do you mean you can't...
Oh, right...
I just remembered a spell to reset everything.
Really!?
Then why didn't you say that earlier?
Well you  have to say this one, not me.
Then tell me already!
It's...
Do I really have to say that?
Yup.
Really loud, too.
Really loud!?
Yep.
Ugh...
Things won't return to normal if you don't.
Fine, then.
I want to ***** with Konata.
Don't worry, Sis.
I won't say a word.
No!
It's not what you think!
Oh yeah, I should go mail Kona-chan.
T-Tsukasa, listen!
You've got it totally wrong!
It was against my will...
What I meant is that she totally...
Here!
You did it!
That was amazing, Hiiragi-chan.
It was just luck, I swear.
There's no way I could hit that...
Hiiragi's little sis.
Don't give up.
Kusakabe-san.
Do you want to live in Hiiragi's shadow forever?
But...
No buts!
Today's your big chance to show your sister up!
Muster up some courage and prove to your sister that you can do it too!
O-Okay.
We'll show 'em the true power of a support character!
I-I'll do my best!
Oh, what a nostalgic scene...
There!
Alright!
Here!
And that's how it's done!
I was so close...
Not bad, Kusakabe!
Here it goes...
Super Ultra Miraculous Eccentric Special...
Serve!
An underhand serve?!
Leave it to me!
Nice receive!
Here!
Not bad...
Not bad at all...
Misakichi, Tsukasa.
We're gonna do a Jet Stream Attack on the attacker!
Roger!
Okay!
By the way, what's a Jet Stream Attack?
Ahh, you're not supposed to say that!
Now the plan won't work!
What are you guys doing?
Take this!
Take that!
Yes!
Eh?
Little Sis!
Tsukasa!
Something like that is impossible...
However...
Even when it's tough
The tears had fallen.
What's that?
Eh!?
You don't know it?
It's cutural literacy for the Japanese!
You're the only one that feels that way.
Little Sis...
There's no point in sulking there.
You're gonna beat down Hiiragi today, right?
I...
I've always been relying on Sis...
Yeah...
Yeah...
I'm sorry.
I'll do everything I can!
I got it!
Good job, Little Sis!
Guu~
One more point...
...and our team will...
...win!
Let's do this!
We won't lose, Hiiragi!
I won't let it...
...end like this!
Here!
Spin.
Stop.
Just call me the Witch of Kasukabe.
There!
Go for it, Little Sis!
Hit it with everything you got!
Alright!
Ow, it hurts as if I just smacked into something.
We did it!
You really shined today, Hiiragi-san.
Eh, really?
Nothing less from Hiiragi-san.
Thanks.
That was amazing!
It was.
Damn it...
I suppose the supporting characters...
...are never meant to win...
I guess I still can't match Sis.
But...
Someday, surely...
Heaven has forsaken us!
Hey, let's go.
Yeah...
I was just trying to get into the mood.
Stop messing around.
Come on.
This is a story that happened during a summer camping trip for our school.
We had decided to take a hike and were in the midst of our orienteering course.
That's when our group...
...somehow ended up lost.
How did this happen?
It's because you  forgot the map and compass on the bus!
Besides, why did we have to go this way?
Well, I suddenly had the urge to climb a mountain.
And why is that?
"Why?" you ask...
Because it's there.
Now now, Sis.
How about we start by checking our cell phones?
As expected, out of range.
Me too.
I got nothing.
Same.
I guess we're doomed.
Ah, geez...
We should've been at the camping grounds by now.
That's true.
According to the schedule, we were supposed to start making dinner at 5PM.
Reacted to the word "dinner", huh?
What about you, aren't you hungry?
Just a bit...
But I ate a ton of these on the bus.
Oh, again!
That one was me.
Anyways, how about we escape absolute starvation with these...
S-Starvation seems a bit exaggerated.
But these...
One, two, three...
We're one short!
Um, may I?
This way, there will be six total.
If we give everyone one piece...
..we can then break the last two into halves again.
How about that?
Yuki-chan, you're incredible!
Nothing less from our Miwiki-san!
Oh it's nothing, really...
Now we won't have to starve to death.
Like I said, you're exaggerating.
However...
Izumi-san's words began to seem like less and less of a joke...
...and more of a reality.
I have a feeling we're completely and utterly lost.
Yes.
We've been walking the same area over and over.
Ah, if only we had a magnet.
I guess I need to smack you across the face with this.
Or perhaps I should shove it down your throat?
How scary!
Kagami, you're serious!
Um...
That looks like the Summer Triangle.
Therefore, I'm pretty sure this direction is East.
Wow Tsukasa, that's pretty amazing.
Tsukasa, do you like stars that much?
Um, this is the only one I know.
One of the big stars of the Summer Triangle is called Vega...
...but it's also the Orihime Boshi.
Since we were born on Tanabata.
The Big Dipper also looks really beautiful.
Listen up, Kagami!
Until the day the Death Omen Star has fallen...
...you must live your life to the fullest!
Although, even if we do know the cardinal directions...
...we still don't know how to get to the camp.
And such is our problem.
Heaven has forsaken us!
Enough of that.
After screaming like that, I'm seriously starting to get hungry.
And whose fault is that?!
I never spoke of the idea openly...
...but I was seriously...
...starting to consider the possibility that we wouldn't make it back.
We're not descending...
Yes.
We've walked quite a bit, huh?
That's right.
I wonder if we lost our sense of direction inside the forest.
You may be right.
Story number ten.
In the silent forest...
...you could hear the *pant* *pant* of their breathing...
What are you doing?
The Gathering of One Hundred Supernatural Tales.
If you tell a hundred ghost stores in a single night...
...a real ghost will descend upon you!
Eh?!
When that happens...
...you can feel a cold sensation on your cheek...
Stop messing around.
But...
...a campout at night means ghost stories!
And after, love stories!
Huh?
D-Did I say something weird?
Story number eighteen.
I tried calling out, "Hey!"
But there was only silence...
...then all of a sudden-
Is that supposed to be the sound of you blowing out a candle?
Yeah.
In The Gathering of One Hundred Supernatural Tales...
...you're supposed to blow out a candle...
...each time you finish a story, right?
That's our Miwiki-san!
And then...
Huh?
What story was I on again?
Story number sixteen, probably.
You're going backwards!
Yes, this is Sazae-
Don't you mean Izumi!?
Where the hell are you guys right now?
Do you guys have any  idea how worried we all were?!
What awaited our return to the camping grounds...
...were Kuroi-sensei's harsh words.
Which is why...
...you must be extra  careful from now on!
We're sorry...
You're hungry, right?
It's delicious.
Yeah, it really is.
Yep, yep.
Indeed...
...the curry we had that day was truly delicious.
Perhaps, it was even the most delicious curry I had ever had.
And so something outrageous like that happened.
It was a really troublesome day.
Oh?
But you seemed to be enjoying yourself while you were telling the story.
Is that so?
Yes.
Very much so.
Yes.
I suppose so.
Hey Kagami.
There's a place I want to stop by on the way back...
We're going straight  home with no detours.
Don't say that...
It won't take long at all.
No way!
But why?
You're getting annoying!
Don't say such harsh words...
Gah, get off of me!
Okay, fine!
But just for a little bit, okay?
Thank you, Kagami!
You're such a nice person, Kagami!
We're going straight home afterwards, okay?
Sure, sure.
By the way, Kona-chan...
Where are we stopping at?
Oh yeah, well...
Some pet show that just recently opened up.
Pet Shop
Oh, a pet shop?
How nostalgic!
Minoru~pa~
Are you going to buy a dog or something?
I want to look at the bunnies.
I want to see the cute puppies.
Not at all.
This  is what I wanted to look at.
Ah, this cat has really nice fur.
Konata, I'll remind you right now...
This cat isn't a witch
or anything, so don't
bother it, okay?
...this cat isn't a witch or anything.
I know that.
I know that. I won't go as far as collecting its soul.
I won't go as far as collecting its soul.
Everything you've said up until now...
I am Zero!
I have returned!
I have returned!
I will use you up like a ragged cloth!
I will use you up like a ragged cloth!
Ah, this cat must have really nice lineage.
Yuki-chan, you come from a really nice lineage as well.
Hey, hey...
I don't think you're using that in the right context.
Well...
Right now, Miyuki-san is the Galactic Fairy.
The Galactic Fairy
Although her appearance is slightly different...
These are the most famous frogs in Pekopon.
Ge~ro Gero Gero
Ta~ma Tama Tama
Ge~ro Gero Gero!
Ta~ma Tama Tama!
Ge-ro Gero Gero
Ta-ma Tama Tama
Ge~ro Gero Gero!
Ta~ma Tama Tama!
Oh!
I'm a dark-spotted frog.
I look like a Japanese tree frog.
I seem to be a bullfrog.
I'm a common toad...
Hey, wait a second!
Hmm...
Now then...
What happened here?
Alrighty then!
For-For-For-Forgot my something...
Oh!
That's...
Legendary Girl A!
This means...
...I must have her buy something!
Behold! The best armament I have collected!
With these slick deals...
Not even Legendary Girl A can resist!
Dammit! She's AFK?!
Good lucky!
It's this era's super...
...super idol, Akira Kogami here!
Long time no see, everyone!
And...
And...!
Her assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
Moving on!
Wait!
Everyone, if he hears you call out for him, I think he'll show up.
But if you're really quiet, he might now hear you...
So please, say it as quietly as you can.
Hey!
Now then, one , two...
Minoru-senpai...
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa!
So, you've appeared after all...
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa...
Wa~
Wa-wa-wa-wa-waa...
You didn't have to show up...
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-waaaa...
Wa-waah...
Hello! I'm the assistant, Minoru Shiraishi.
You're not gonna do a little skit for us?
A skit?
Usually...
...you would stop in front of the camera...
Yes.
And then you would say, "And now I'll put on a little performance..."
Right?
Now, let's try it!
Start!
How's that?
That's 10 years worth of experience for you.
Not bad at all.
Thank you very much.
And so, nice to meet you, everyone.
Speaking of...
Yes.
What's this?
Oh, this?
It's something that's pretty popular around these parts.
Nezumi-senpai.
Hmm...
Right now, it's totally in style.
I hear it's the best.
Okay, whatever.
What?
Anyways!
You don't even care?
Okay, what is it then?
What I'm referring to is this entire situation.
What's up with this?
Eh?
What's up with what?
Well, it's a live-action filming.
A live...
A live Lucky Channel.
Something like that...
It's so loud!!
Now, now, now, now...
Let's calm down, okay?
I mean, c'mon...
Isn't this lovely?
It's lovely.
What is this?
What's up with that teary-eyed face?
I'm telling you, this is an animation!
Oh, but there was an animation.
Just before this.
What about me?
W-Well...
What about Akira Kogami?
Yes.
Let me repeat myself...
Okay.
I'm this era's...
Right.
This era's...
Super idol!
Right, right.
That's correct.
Which is why...
...we had you do this live performance that one one else could pull off.
I mean...
...it's a visual animation.
So we need to have some animations...
...and also some visuals...
Which is why...
Ah.
By having both parts separate and then together...
...it'll be twice as good.
I just realized.
What?
It's a bit like...
And Original...
Yes.
...Visual...
...and Animation?
Animation?
Yes.
So, Minoru Shiraishi is an original...
Yes.
...in the visual...
...as well as the animation?
That means the entire program is about you!
Wait...
That's not true!
Geez!!
You have it wrong!
Even though Akira is supposed to be the super idol!
You're absolutely correct.
Why are all the staff...
...on Minoru-kun's...
Geez!!
Okay, okay...
Please calm down.
There's not enough love!
Calm down.
I am shocked.
Shocked?
YOU are SHOCK!
The skies have fallen from love.
Um..
Yeah...
YOU are SHOCK!
Look...
My heart has fallen.
It's playing...
Look.
Um, the theme song...
See?
Even bound by chains, the heart burns.
What's this?
Oh this... this is nothing!
It's useless now.
It'll disappear over here, so don't worry about it!
The staff, everyone, loves you...
Those who interfere will be taken down by a single finger.
Don't worry, Akira-sama.
It's hot.
It's too hot?
Oh, excuse me?
Could we get some water or something?
Thank you very much.
YOU are SHOCK!
Staff, may I have some water?
The pulse quickens from love.
Yes, please.
Some water, please... ah.
Here, here it comes.
Thank you very much.
Now, please rest a little, okay?
YOU are SHOCK!
My pulse quickens.
Okay?
Yeah...
Anyways...
Searching for you,
This is fine too.
Yeah...
My wandering heart is now burning up.
Like I was saying...
Now that I think about it, I'm a little thirsty, too.
Everything must dissolve and scatter apart tragically.
Excuse me, um...
Um...
Staff!
Staff!
Um, could I also...
To protect our love,
...get some water here?
Staff!
You departed on a journey.
Staff!
Ah, yes.
I would like some water...
Had lost sight of tomorrow.
Wait...
Why are you taking the mic?
H-Huh, that's a bit strange...
Umm...
I don't want to see,
Hey, where's my water?
My water...
Staff~
Such a face that has forgotten how to smile.
Reclaim the love!
I see...
So that's how it is...
You are already dead!
Huh?
But...
You know...
This is all wrong.
While this certainly is water...
It's not quite what I was expecting...
Hey...
It's...
...wrong...
Oh.
Welcome back.
You know...
I mean... seriously.
Yes.
Something like that...
Yeah, yeah...
Well...
You know...
And so...
Yes.
I've been thinking...
They kept on telling me, "You'll be in the main series."
Yes.
But those were all empty promises.
So then I tried being a pop star...
...but that didn't last long, either.
Right.
And so...
...I even told them that I was willing to play some side parts and the like in the main series, you know?
Right.
But here I am...
It'll be fine, Akira-sama!
You'll see!
Good things will happen!
But they haven't...
Not matter what I do...
It's like there's just not enough love in here...
Akira...
Akira-sama, the ending...
Ehh?!
It's the end already?
Akira's so lonely!
That's it for today.
And then this!
Oh, this is new.
Certainly...
Right around here.
Around here.
Somewhere...
Please send all your love to Akira!
Yes.
Please!
And thus...
Yes.
I await the next time we can see each other again!
But for now, bye-bee!
Bye-bee!!
I'm seriously going to do my best.
I'm already at the top.
As high as the heavens.
Thank you very much.
What?
What is it?

Yes.
I've decided.
About what?
Well...
Yes.
I'm going to aim for the top.
Yes.
Somewhere so high you can't touch me.
That's a good idea!
Something like that...
You're approaching it then.
Slowly but surely...
Like...
Inching your way to the top.
You know,
Right, it makes me think I should climb to the top.
Right, right.
Something like...
The both of us climbing to the top...
Zoom!
Zoom!
Let's do it. Just like that.
And we'll figure it out just like that.
Right?
And we'll be at the top just like that.
Seems unreliable, but I'll give it a shot.
Alright!
On your mark! Get set!
Wow. That was so amazing! You're so good at sports and I always wondered: How come you don't join a team or anything?
'Cause if I got on a team and started playing sports, I'd miss all of my prime-time anime shows. Hey, which end of a chocolate cornet do you eat first?
Huh? Umm, I think I start at the head.
Really... So which side of this thing's the head, anyway? The fat part or the skinny?
I always thought that this end of it, the thin one, was the head.
Oh. See, I always thought the fatter end was the head. So, why do you think the thinner end's the head?
Doesn't it look like a seashell? Why do you think it's the fatter end?
I always thought it looked more like a caterpillar.
A caterpillar?
Yeah, but when you think about it, I guess a seashell's a much better image.
Um, you know... There's another way to eat it. Tear off the thin end and dip it in the chocolate cream on the fat end.
Good idea!
It figures you'd know that. You're so smart!
Well, not really. Everyone has their own way of eating one.
How about cream puffs? How do you eat them?
Huh? How do I eat a cream puff? That's easy. I split it in half horizontally, then I take the top half and dip it into the cream in the bottom part. Then, after most of the cream is gone, I start eating the bottom. I find that if I eat it that way, it keeps the cream from spurting out, and I can have equal amounts of cream and pastry in each bite.
Huh...
What do you do about the ones that have both custard and cream? Do you have a system to eat those? Do you mix the flavors together?
No, I don't have a system for those per se. Wait, how exactly does one mix the flavors?
Uhh, just asking...
When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake? Or a chestnut on top of a mont-blanc?
Let's see now... It depends on the amount of strawberries that are sandwiched between the layers of sponge cake. With the strawberries, the whipped cream and the sponge cake, I pace it so that I can get a bit in each and every bite. So getting to the strawberry on top of the cake is always different for me.
Hmm... That's a solid move.
When I eat it, I always save the strawberry on top for last. Sometimes, I get so full that I can't eat it. In other times, someone in my family comes along and takes it away.
And that's why you should always eat your favorite part first.
Come to think, I've never seen anyone take her strawberry away from her.
That's her for ya! She's sharp.
Here's one. Can you eat the very last bite of an ice pop without dropping it?
Wait, you drop it?
If you don't eat it the right way... It falls off, doesn't it?
Yes.
How do you do it?
I suck it off the stick.
Oh...
Or maybe you could just turn it around while you eat it, like this.
Oh, that's a good idea.
And then there's soft-serve ice cream, which I'm not very fond of.
Huh? What's wrong with it?
I hate how you're always left with an empty cone at the end of it.
You're right. There's never any ice cream left, just the cone.
I always try to push the ice cream further and further down into the cone as I eat it.
But how in the world do you do that?
While I eat it, I do a push and shove thing.
A push and shove thing?
You try to balance everything out, don't you?
I suppose.
Oh, here's another one. How do you eat curried rice? Do you mix the curry with the rice?
No, but I do try to have equal amounts of curry and rice left over for my last bite.
I like mixing it up. How do you eat it?
It all depends on the curry. If I pour some sauce on it or drop a raw egg on top, then I mix it up.
You put sauce on curry?
Oh, yeah. It's tasty.
Do you put sauce on fried eggs too?
Nope, I put soy sauce on fried eggs.
Oh. See, when I use that I use mayonnaise.
Mayonnaise on fried eggs, but not on hard-boiled eggs?
Mm-hm. You know, mayonnaise is good with pretty much every egg dish.
You put it on curry too?
Mm-hmm! I put mayo on white rice and on beef bowls. It goes good with that sweet broth. Oh, and on parent-child bawls, too. You know how the chicken's the parent and the egg's the child? And how mayonnaise is made from eggs too? I just put a little blob of it on top and I call that the Relative Bowl.
Hmm.
And I used to really hate natto beans, but if I put some mayonnaise on them, I can eat 'em.
Ugh, I can't imagine that.
Oh, but the tastiest thing has to be when you put mayonnaise right on top of some soft-boiled eggs!
Even the fried eggs are half-cooked at my house.
Really?
Yup. That's just how my dad likes his eggs. I guess it's because he always liked to suck on the yolk. So if you fry the egg too much, then the yolk gets too hard and my dad can't suck the yolk out.
So, how do you eat chicken skewers?
What do you mean "how"?
Do you eat it right off the skewer? Or do you pull it off with chopsticks?
Let me see... When I'm alone, I'll eat it off the skewer. But when I'm eating in public or with company, I'll use chopsticks to pull it off.
Yeah, and dontcha feel weird when there's only one piece left on the plate?
Yes. The last bite certainly makes things awkward at the table.
And then it gets later and later, and no one eats it. It gets all dry and stale, and it's not lookin' so tasty. And no one really wants to eat it, but they don't wanna say anything. And then the waiter comes over to take the plate, and you're like, "Whoa, we're still eating that!" In the end, we all go home without eating that last bite.
Oh, that's such a waste!
I feel sorry for it... Oh, with Korean barbecue, I feel sorry for the meat that's left on the grill that turns to charcoal.
Well, at a Korean barbecue, you're always eating and chatting at the same time. So you get a little distracted.
And when you're grilling beef tongue with green onions, that cooks really fast!
Oh, you're so right. It's already done cooking by the time you flip it over, isn't it?
Wait. You flip it over?
Huh?
You flip it over?
Hm.
You should never flip beef tongue with green onions!
Why shouldn't I flip it?
'Cause if you flip it over, all the green onions on top will fall into the grill!
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You don't need to flip it over at all. You roast it on one side and the heat cooks it all the way through.
I get it. I guess I'll do that from now on.
You absolutely, positively never flip it.
Never flip it.
Ever.
Oh...
Oh, which end of a chocolate cornet is the head - the fat end or the skinny end?
Eh!
Such a bad boy! What's with all the kidnappings lately? I mean, these guys imprison girls and force them to call them "Master" and stuff. It's sick.
Oh...
I think it's about guys playing way too many dating sims and erotic games. The "Master/Slave" thing is a pretty common scenario, you know.
Oh yeah, like you'd know all about that. Wait, you're a sophomore, how do you know about erotic game scenarios?!
You're amazing. You're always at the top of the class.
Huh?
Don't you have any faults?
It's a little embarrassing, but I guess I tend to think about things too much. So much that I end up spacing out. I sometimes cut my finger using the veggie slicer. Ow! Sometimes I'll trip on my feet and fall down. Or, a corner of my tote bag will get caught in the train's door.
Wow...
Whoa, hold it! Those aren't called faults. People call those moe points!
Huh? "Moe points"?
Clumsy is sexy.
What have you been thinking this whole time?
How come you wear glasses? I mean you're really pretty, but you can only appeal to a tiny section of the fan base.
Appeal to... Besides the whole popularity thing, don't glasses actually make your vision worse? How come you never switched to wearing contacts?
Well, it's a little embarrassing to admit now that I'm in a high school. But I suppose you could say... I'm afraid of contact lenses! Actually, I'm pretty scared to put anything into my eyes. I can't even open my eyes underwater.
Dang! She's a natural airhead. A total cutie pie! Hey, isn't that over there?
Huh?
I wonder if she broke down and decided to get some contacts. I guess she's probably better off with the glasses after all.
That must have hurt.
And she's that way naturally.
Staying home 'cause she's got a cold, huh?
Mm-hmm. But at least she's only got a cold and not the flu, you know?
Thankfully I'm stupid, so I don't have to worry about catching flus and stuff.
I heard that works with a cold, but I didn't know it was the same for the flu.
I thought the flu was the deluxe version of the cold. You're saying that colds and flus are two different things?
I... I guess I think they're different things... Or maybe they aren't, I don't know anymore. I'm kinda confused now.
Oh, the difference between influenza and a cold?
Mm! Mm!
Let me see now... Influenza is a viral illness with many symptoms such as fever and muscle aches. If it's not treated, there's a risk of more serious complications. On the other hand, the symptoms of a cold are sore throat and a runny nose, and the fever doesn't run as high. Those are just a few of the symptoms that differ from the flu.
Hmm...
So to answer your question, yes, they are different illnesses.
Oh, really...
Oh, but then again, colds and flus do share many common traits. I guess one could say a flu is sort of a "scaled-up" version of a cold after all.
I knew it!
Why are you looking so serious, huh?
Uh, it's nothin'. Just something that's been buggin' me since our conversation this morning.
Huh? The one about colds and flus?
You didn't disagree with me when I said I was stupid, did you?
Wait, it's not like that! I didn't mean...
Hello, come in.
She came by to visit.
Oh, thanks for coming to see her!
No worries, I'll just go up. Thanks!
Sure is cute when she's sleeping, isn't she? Okay, she's awake now.
How'd you get into my room?! What are you doing here?! Get out! Huh? You came by for a visit? All the way out here to see me?
Yup, that's right.
Oh no. I appreciate the thought, but I'd feel terrible if you caught this thing. Oh, this makes me so happy! She's all worried about me because of that new virus that's going around. I thought the only things she cared about were games and anime. But now... this is so touching! Huh?
'Kay, so uh, I'm gonna copy that homework we got the other day. But you don't have to get up, you cute little sleepy face you!
Out!
Hey! Someone's come over to visit you!
Okay!
May I come in?
Oh, I hope this isn't too much trouble.
Not at all. You should be resting though. Here's a little something.
Thank you. I'm feeling a lot better now. I took some medicine, so my fever is down.
Here.
Wow! You brought me flowers and fruit! You shouldn't have! Come on, sit down.
Oh, thank you, I will. I had thought of coming by to visit you with someone. Unfortunately, I just couldn't seem to find any time. I'm sorry.
No, really. It's fine!
Ah, I almost forgot. I brought you the minutes from the last committee meeting.
Oh, well, thank you!
Have a look at it when you can, but only when you're feeling up to it. There's no rush.
Hm.
There's that and I have the budget requests for each club here. What else was there, let me see now... let's see... Oh, but you're not feeling all right now! I should go home so you can rest.
Now, this is what a visit should be like!
What do you mean? What happened?
Well, you know how someone came by yesterday?
That's what happened.
Maybe that was just her funny little way of showing you she cared. Perhaps the bit with the homework was her attempt at cheering you up. And maybe she was trying not to wake you up, but couldn't help noticing you as you slept. And that would certainly explain how she saw you sleeping.
I never would've thought of it that way! Is this girl a saint or something?!
Oh, I just realized. I haven't seen her today.
Morning... Are you feeling any better today? You need anything?
Look at that. My sister isn't even sick and she's more relaxed than I am.
Well, it's not like I'm always sleeping in this late, really. Today's like "Spring Sleep Dawn" something or other. Oh! By the way, good morning!
Oh, I know how that is. Lately even I'm having trouble waking up in the morning.
Yeah, I know. And I've been so sleepy lately...
Me too. It's especially warm out today, so that doesn't help either.
Mm-hm, isn't it though?
You really can't help it.
Wasn't it warm a couple of days ago during our break?
It was.
When I woke up, it was just starting to get dark. I spent the whole day sleeping. Can you believe it?
It's a good thing if you can rest up when you have the day off.
Yeah, but the thing is, I was in my pajamas all day. Oh! Like today!
I had no idea those were your pajamas.
Oh yeah, they're my jammies!
I think they're adorable! Why, they don't even look like pajamas.
You think so?
Yes.
Do you think it's okay if I wear them all day?
I think you could even go outside in them.
I wonder...
Jeez, would someone get to the punchline already?

It's gone up a little... No, wait! The bra that I'm wearing has under-wires and extra padding. That's why I'm heavier today. Yeah, that's it, yeah. I wonder how much that is in grams? If I just subtract...
Huh... it's over! I totally screwed up! I forgot I had a physical exam today, so I wore my character-print underwear. I'm so embarrassed now!
I'm still short!
Heheh.
How dare you look happier than the rest of us, damn you!
Hey! I'm here now.
Oh, hiya.
I just thought of something. You always come here to hang out. What's the deal? Don't you have any friends from your own class?
Unlike you, I have friends. Are you trying to pick a fight?
No, I just thought they were avoiding you, is all.
Why don't you worry about yourself for a change, and get to work on those social skills?
Social skills? What are you talking about? See, even though I look like this, I've got about a hundred friends. Both my social and my bargaining skills are actually pretty high. Oh, and I go to parties every night.
Huh?
And with my allies, I strive to restore the light to the crystals, rescue the kidnapped princess and save the world from ruin.
Wait, you're talking about a game!
Oh yeah, I haven't seen that guy in a while...
What guy?
She's talking about one of her game buddies.
Hm, he's a warrior-class character, who wanted to improve his hand-to-hand combat skills. He left to train somewhere else where there's lots of monsters, but hasn't come back yet.
Oh.
I heard from someone else that he's camping out in one of the underground caverns. I wonder if he's all right though, being all cooped up down there like that? Everyone's worried about him.
How do you get cooped up in a game?
Trust me, it happens. I don't know, but by the looks of his login info, he's been playing the game nonstop for days.
Cooped up in the real world too, huh!
Whatever, it's the same guy in both worlds.
I always wanted to ask you guys this. How'd the two of you become friends, anyway?
Was about to be kidnapped by some big, suspicious foreign dude. I just happened along, saw what was goin' down and jumped in! I unloaded the Front Punch Whirlwind Kick combo attack on him and rescued her from that creep!
Why does everything you talk about revert back to gaming?
Hey, I was just doin' what any other skilled martial artist would've done, you know?
I don't approve the use of hasty violence, but you did save her.
The thing is that the foreigner was just asking me for directions. I couldn't understand what he was saying though and that's when she came by.
Wait, that's no good! How can you be so smug about it!
Oh, that's right. It's that time of year again, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
I just remembered that baseball season's starting soon.
Oh, do you not like watching sports and stuff? I sort of figured you'd love watching sports because you're so athletic.
If a game goes into extra innings, it's guaranteed to totally screw up the late-night programming schedule for anime! Or even worse, they could end up canceling the broadcast for that night.
It stinks when something you like disappears, doesn't it?
When do you eat the strawberry on top of a strawberry shortcake?
Why do you wanna know?
I was just wondering if you like to save your favorites for last.
I guess I save my favorite stuff for the last bite. Although with strawberries, it depends.
Beef tongue with green onions - you cook both sides?
Beef tongue with green onions? Hmm. It cooks pretty fast, but I guess if you roast it on both sides, it'll get done quicker.
You can't! The green onions fall off.
But you put the green onions on it after the meat's been cooked.
But if you do that, the onions won't get roasted.
But the green onions are just a topping, aren't they?
Man, you just don't get it at all...
Wait, maybe you can cook it both ways?
Oh, which end of a chocolate cornet is the head - is it the fat end or the skinny end?
Hmm. The fat end?
Wow, guess we agree on that.
Uh, you are kidding!
Okay, so which end do you eat first?
Hmm. Don't you tear off the thin end and dip it in the chocolate in the fat end?
Uh...
Hm.
Do you have any other friends besides us and the ones you have in video games?
Oh, yeah. I used to have this really good friend back in junior high school.
Oh, you actually had one.
Yeah, but I haven't talked to her in a while. I wonder what she's up to these days?
Oh...
You know, I remember in our junior high yearbook she wrote that her big dream in life was to become a mage.
So she was a geek too!
(cheerfully) Hiya, Luckies! It's time for the first-ever episode of Lucky Channel! So throw your hands up in the air and say, "Yay!" And a big hello to all the viewers tuning in! I'm Akira Kogami, and I'll be your navigator.
And, I'm Shiraishi.
Who's that? Just kidding! Allow me to introduce Minoru Shiraishi. He's gonna be my number one assistant! Dan-dan-dan-da~!
Yeah, well, I am Minoru Shiraishi, and I will be Akira-sama's assistant from now on. Howdy.
My my my! You're so tense, Shiraishi-san! Come on now, you're finally on TV. Loosen up, you big stick-in-the-mud, you! Kidding...
Sorry, I'm just not used to this.
I know it's only our first show, but we've already got bunches of letters from viewers just like you.
Okay, we got a letter here from a viewer in Osaka calling themselves "I love Berry-kou". Dear Lucky Channel, congratulations on your first-ever episode!
Thank you, thank you!
By the way, I've got a question for Akira-san. You are referred to as a "super idol" by everyone, including yourself. How much money do you make as an idol? Please tell me.
What I'm paid...?
Yes. You know, this question's kinda personal, so maybe we should move on.
(gruffly) Yeah, you know. What are you thinking asking a question like that?
A-Akira-sama...?
Well, it totally depends on the job. You know, some gigs are cheap. Some are really cheap. Either way, I get paid a flat fee from the production company, so who knows how much money those guys are skimmin' off the top. I've been in this business since I was three years old and every cent of my pay still gets direct-deposited into my parents' bank account. So all I get is a small allowance - and believe me, it's tiny. Oh, come to think of it, Mama has been buying a lot of brand-name bags lately. She couldn't be spending the money from this show already? You vampire! Just because Dad stopped sending money after the divorce, you're gonna suck me dry now, huh? What do you think I am? Some kind of Cinderella or something?
Oh, wait... Akira-sama... I don't think they wanted to know all that other stuff!
(cheerfully) Huh? Oh no! It's time for us to say good-bye, I'm so sad now! Please send us your questions and comments. If you guys have ideas or opinions about the show, or if you wanna tell me how much you love me, start sending those letters, 'kay? Is there anything you wanna add, Shiraishi-san?
Uh... right! So, I hope you guys tune in to see us next episode!
See ya! (gruffly) I heard they're giving you a part in the show. Is that right?
Huh? How'd you hear that?
Thanks for breakfast.
Can you help me with this problem?
If you can't figure it out, do you honestly think I could?
You're in college, aren't you?!
Do me a favor. Wake Tsukasa up.
No, she won't wake up for me.
Honey, wake up already!
Dad sure is late, isn't he?
Yeah, didn't he have a groundbreaking ceremony this morning?
Okay, Mom. What time is it?
I'm home.
It's past noon!
Hi, Dad! How was work?
Good morning...
It's afternoon.
How can you sleep for so long?
Did you see the special finale of Love Apron last night?
No, missed it.
I fell asleep in the middle.
You didn't see the end? I can't believe you slept through the end of it. This guy shows up out of nowhere with a red bucket on his head!
Kagami, Miyuki-chan's on the phone for you.
'Kay.
I was wondering if you'd like to get together to go over the answers on our homework?
Sure, that sounds like an awesome idea!
Kagami, Konata-chan's on the phone.
Yeah, so, do you wanna get together to go over all the answers to our homework?
Wait a minute! You're just gonna copy all my answers, aren't ya?!
'Kay, I'm here. Can I copy your homework now?
Man, talk about being blunt. Fine! You can copy my homework if you want, but if you don't do it on your own, you're still gonna blow that exam we have coming up after the break.
I guess you're right. In the long run, it's not gonna be good for me.
I'm good at pulling all-nighters before a test. So I'm down with the copying action.
Do you even have a conscience?!
Hello, everyone.
Oh, hi, Miyuki-san.
Hey, what's up?
Are you going to be studying with us as well, Izumi-san?
No, she's just gonna copy it. You're kidding me. Haven't either of you done your homework? Okay, what'd you guys do during the break?
Let's see...
I got 23 pages of math, 20 pages of world history, and 30 pages of English to do. I got a five-day break... If I study for five, no, four hours a day... Math takes 1.15 pages an hour...
Oh no, I haven't done any homework today! Let's see... I've got three days left, so I guess if I work... six hours a day?
Two more days... If I work all day and night...
Well, girls, Golden Week's almost over now. Were you two able to get done with all your homework and stuff?
Yeah, so do you wanna get together to go over all the answers to our homework?
I wanted to get everything done. I even had it planned out.
Your plans failed.
Your resistance was futile.
You're worse off than her!
Huh? At least she tried her best and did it on her own. No matter what anyone says, deep down, she's a hard worker. But her accuracy's horrible, I can't bear it. Horrible, just horrible!
So, were you guys able to have any fun during the short break? I know you had quite a lot of homework to do, and you also have that little midterm thing today. Don't tell me you spent the whole vacation goofing off instead of studying!
Ma'am, that didn't feel like a vacation at all!
Life's tough. I just kicked back and played around the whole time!
Oh, ma'am...
Yeah?
I kicked back and played around the whole time too!
Hey!
I always thought they designed these things so that you couldn't get the prizes.
Uh, kinda depends on the prize. Some of these are supposed to be hard to get.
Really?
Whatever, I never felt like trying it anyway.
Oh, amazing!
Yeah, this little guy is an easy one to grab.
Really?
If it's that easy to get one, maybe if I tried it...
"...I could get one too." Is that what you were thinking?
No! What are you talking about? I wasn't thinking anything! But I guess it couldn't hurt to just try this one time.
You know, you wanna try it...
Go for it, Sis. You can do it!
Darn! Thought I had that one for sure.
Oh, bummer.
Huh? Ah? Uhgh!... Shoot! No way! Why?!
A wise man once said that, "A UFO catcher's someone else's piggy bank."
True words of wisdom.
What... Oh, again... Oh no! I totally suck at this game. You've got really good rhythm, Kona-chan.
Nah, it doesn't have anything to do with rhythm. Rhythm, coordination, problem solving - the skills you get from gaming are useless in the real world.
Looking at you, I don't doubt that one bit.
Wow, you're super strong.
Yeah, I know...
How much money does she spend on these things?
Izumi! Hm? Has anyone seen Izumi today?
Hey, Miss Kuroi! I got a Miss Izumi on the line for ya.
Kuroi speaking. Why aren't you in class?
I'm sorry. I gotta take the day off. I'm not feeling too good.
That's unusual. Did you catch a cold or something?
No, it's just the May sickness is all...
Huh?
I feel sluggish you know.
Hurry up and get down here!
Hey! We're going home now. What's up, Konata? Why are you stuffing all those books in your bag?
The exams start tomorrow, and that means I gotta take all my books home tonight so I can cram till dawn.
You never take your books home to study? You leave them in here everyday? Unbelievable. Look, Konata, for one thing, there's no way you're gonna learn all that stuff the night before an exam!
Eh, I've always made it through exams doin' it this way.
You're confident. We'll see how long that attitude lasts you tomorrow.
Okay, I'm gonna return the exams you took the other day!
Oh...
Not too shabby. How'd you do?
Please don't ask, Sis... But I did the best I could, you know.
How about you, Little Miss All-nighter?
Totally passed it!
You aren't human, are ya?!
Blah... I don't feel like doing anything.
Come on! We're all going home. On the way home, you always end up hanging out with us anyway.
Oh, it's Comp-Fest! And they're gonna be giving out QUO Cards. I gotta collect them all! Right, time to get a part-time job!
You're talking out loud to yourself again.
That's crazy! I've never heard of anyone using a case of May sickness as an excuse before.
Oh, I understand where she's coming from though.
Well, they call it a sickness, so the excuse is totally legit, isn't it?
Do you honestly think that's true?
Yeah.
What exactly is the May sickness, anyway?
Miyuki, do you wanna explain it?
Well, by definition, May sickness happens after you've accomplished a major goal - such as a college entrance exam, or if you've just gotten a new job. It also happens when a relationship that started in April doesn't work out. Or when you can't reconcile the life you wanted versus the life you have. The symptoms include lethargy, apathy, and even a mild depression. You see, if you just feel lethargic, I don't think you can call that the May sickness.
Besides, all of us are still in the eleventh grade, so it doesn't even apply to us yet.
I like the change of pace in spring. I always do my best this time of year.
Oh, yeah. I guess I can see your point though. I tend to feel a little blah around this time of year too. I don't know, it's like sometimes I don't even feel like doing homework and stuff when I get home.
Yeah, I'm the same way!
I'm skipping the snide remark. I'm pooped!
What's wrong, Yuki-chan? Why are you sighing and stuff?
I'm a little embarrassed to talk about it; it's like my phobia about contact lenses. I'm afraid to go to the dentist, and I put it off for so long that my cavity's gotten worse. And now it's so bad that it hurts even when I drink water.
But, isn't that... sorta normal? I mean, I'm afraid of that too.
But if you knew it was gonna get this bad, then why didn't you take care of it earlier?
Huh?
Well, even though I knew it was going to be tough for me when my teeth started hurting...
For some reason, you still don't want to go to the dentist.
Even after the pain starts, you still don't wanna go anywhere near a dentist. You just put it off and try to bear it for as long as possible.
Are dentists really that scary? I've never had to deal with them, so I don't know.
You've never been to a dentist? I'm jealous.
There's that distinct medicine you smell in the office, and then the tension as you wait in the lobby.
I know, and the sound of those drills drilling away in the back!
Change Getter!
So scary!
Maybe guys like going to the dentists more than girls do.
Why's that?
Don't they say that a drill is kinda like a guy's...?
Dinosaur Empire! I hear guys go totally nuts for battles between robots that use drills for weapons!
Eh? Yeah, but I think they'd hate to have their teeth shaved off. Y'know what? When you go to the dentist, have you ever noticed how pretty all the dental assistants and receptionists are?
Come to think of it, they are.
I wonder why that would be?
Maybe the person hiring them has certain aesthetic standards.
Beautiful dental assistants and drills...
The way you put it, I agree, it does seem more geared towards men.
Then what do you think a dentist geared more for women would be like?
First thing they'd have to get rid of would be that medicine you smell.
And the chair they put you in should be one of those puffy reclining chairs with a massager in it!
Aromatherapy would be relaxing. Uh, and you could also have a foot massage at the same time.
That sounds good.
And if you were able to play games while they were drilling on you, that would help to ease the pain!
It might be hard to play games then...
But it is a good idea to have something to distract us.
Like putting on some headphones and listening to your favorite tunes.
Yeah, good one.
That's a great idea.
Mm-hmm.
But in the end, I still don't wanna go to the dentist.
Me neither...
What the...?!
Now what's wrong?
They're turning another one of my favorite series into an anime. But the cast is totally different from the one on the drama CD.
Really? I don't get what the big deal is.
Is this like an act of God or something? Politics? Money? What?
I never got into drama CDs, so I don't care who's in the cast. If the voices match the characters in the original series, I'm okay.
But that's not how it works, Kagamin! If you're used to listening to the drama CDs, it's weird when you start watching the anime and all the voices are different. See, it takes a long time before that weirdness goes away.
Huh?
But something good definitely comes out of news like this.
Yeah, like what?
Drama CDs and anime... You can enjoy two worlds with two different sets of voices. That's two for the price of one!
You're quite the tough shopper, aren't you?
Well, guys, looks like Miyuki-san's left a nugget on her plate. So it's up to us to figure out who's gonna get to eat it. How about we have a staring contest and the winner gets to eat it?
What? That is so childish.
That sounds fun. Come on, let's do it!
I think Kagami may have already won.
You say something?
Then let's begin the staring contest right now. Blah-blah!
Hahahaha... Tha... that was insane!
Amazing!
That doesn't even look human!
Jeez, you guys. Talk about overreacting.
I'm sorry I took so long. The bathroom was crowded. Did I miss something?
Come on, show Miyuki that crazy face you just made!
No, I don't want to.
It was amazing, Miyuki! You've never seen anything like this ever!
Fine.
Isn't that totally amazing!
It'll come in handy for the special talent section of your college application.
Yeah. Use it... use it to apply to college as I'm sure you'll get accepted!
Yeah, that's not really a compliment..
So I saw this report on TV about how many books the average Japanese person reads in a year. Anyway, they said manga wasn't good enough, and that only normal books counted.
Isn't manga...
I wonder if light novels would count?
Huh? I don't know... I guess it's okay if we counted light novels.
What about picture books?
Oh... Um... they're called books, so I guess they count?
If you said Harry Potter and books like that are ordinary, everyone who's into the fantasy genre would agree, right? So, is there such a thing as an "ordinary" book?
Umm...
Besides, they ended the whole report by saying something about how the younger generation is starting to turn away from printed media and stuff. The thing is, we use the net to look at all kinds of websites and blogs, so I think we actually read more stuff these days than ever before.
Yeah, I kinda get what you're saying, and kinda not...
Hey guys! Are you ready to go home?
Yeah, almost.
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't go home with you guys today.
Huh? What's the deal? Do you have to run an errand or something?
Mm. I started a part-time job, that's why.
Huh? Wait! She started a part-time job? Is the Comp-Fest that important to her?!
You know, I'm really surprised Konata actually went through with it.
Me too. She really got herself a part-time job. I thought she was just kidding about getting one.
Hmm... I wonder about it though...
Huh?
I'm more surprised by the fact that someone actually went and hired her.
That doesn't sound very nice!
Well, for one thing, I'm having a hard time picturing her being a diligent worker.
Good point, Sis.
I wonder where she ended up working?
Maybe she works at a bookstore? You know how she likes manga.
I wanna buy this.
Yeah, hang on a sec. I'm in the middle of something right now.
Bwha...?
Got 'em!
I really hope she doesn't get fired...
How about a convenience store?
I wanna buy this.
That'll be 498 yen please... Arigatog...... .........
Uh...?
Ehh... not there.
Maybe a fast-food place?
Got a problem with my smile?
Maybe not.
Family restaurants are also out of the question.
Welcome...
I wonder what kind of job she got?
Yeah...
Maybe she's a traffic monitor?
Nah.
A video rental place?
I don't know.
An Izakaya?
That's not it.
Pizza delivery?
No license.
Supermarket cashier?
Nope.
Cram school teacher?
You're kidding!
A bread factory?
Huh?
Let's see... Hmm...
Let's ask her tomorrow.
Hey, Konata. What kind of place are you working at?
Yeah, tell us!
Hmm? Oh, it's just your average cosplay cafe.
Ughh, that's perfect for her!
Should she be working there?
Hiya, Luckies! Second episode! It's me, Akira Kogami, your host! I hope you're all excited, 'cause I sure am! And sitting right next to me is a wonderful young man who's going to assist me on the show, Mr. Minoru Shiraishi.
I for-for-for... I'm Minoru Shiraishi, Akira-sama's assistant. I'm still really new at this, so all I'm hopin' for is that you guys remember my name. Yeah...
Clappity clap clap... Now we know it's just the second episode of Lucky Channel, but we've already got tons of messages from you guys. Yup! Tons and tons of messages! You guys are making me super happy. Thank you!
It's pretty amazing, isn't it? All this attention is because you're so popular, Akira-sama. Uh... what?
Saw the show today.
Yeah?
You were in it?
Huh?
The show, man. You had a part.
Oh. Yeah, they did give me a little part.
Yeah... They did, didn't they? Uh-huh? So, what was the scene you were in, anyway?
Sure, um... It was scene 45, part A - the classroom after vacation.
Right, right. Yeah, now, I remember... You came and went by so fast I'd almost forgotten.
Yeah, well, I only had one line in the scene, so I...
Nahh! You complaining or...!?
No! Nobody's complaining!
You should be thrilled those guys are giving a newbie like you a line in a scene. Things were different when I debuted on the screen...
Oh, really. How old were you when you made your debut?
Three years old. Back then I was ecstatic that they even gave me a crummy line. But it's not about how many lines you get after all.
Well, it was pretty tense for a while there, being surrounded by the biggest names in the industry. What an amazing experience!
Yeah, you were tense. I could tell.
Huh?
You were stiff as a board. You looked like a total amateur. Tell you what. I don't usually do this, but what the hell. Come on. Let's hit that scene together, you and me.
Uhh, you mean like right now?
They might bring you back for another episode, right?
Yeah, I guess.
Then, you have to practice your craft, man. Listen, I'm offering to help you out here!
No, yeah. I got it, I got it! Thank you, I really appreciate it.
The script, please. So, which scene was it?
The scene 45.
Oh yeah, this one. Okay. I'll play Kuroi, the teacher.
Whenever you're ready.
Ready and... action! "So, were you guys able to have any fun during the short break? I knowyou had a quie... q, qui, quiet...?
That's "quite".
...quite a lot of homework to do. You also got that little midterm thingy today. Don't tell me you spent the whole vacation goofing off instead of studying."
" Ma'am, that didn't feel like a vacation at all! "
What was that?!
What?
That totally sucked. There's no motivation - the line didn't deliver!
Deliver?
Deliver here, right here! I gotta feel it!
Oh, I'm sorry...
Hell, if you're just gonna say the line, a monkey can do that.
But, monkeys can't talk, ma'am, I...
Huh!?
Unyu? Hm... I guess it's time to say goodbye now. I think it's sad when happy times like this go by so fast, don't you? Well, anyway, keep on sending your questions and comments! And please don't forget me. I need to know you love me too, 'kay?
And we'll see all of you in the next episode.
See ya later! Bye bye, everybody!
Yeah, so... what do they like?
By "they" you mean...
The cast. Somebody's getting kicked off, yeah? They hate each other, right? Bunch of divas, right?
No, it's not like that. Everybody's pretty cool!
Then, why don't you help a girl out...?!
Amazing Kona-chan!
And what a passionate performance!
Hey, Konata! Are the next two songs gonna be like the last one?
I picked a couple of anime songs, with a few from some live-action shows.
That's not the point! Pick songs that the rest of us can recognize.
Hey, I can sing whatever I want. So chill out!
Fine, whatever. Hey, Tsukasa! Punch some songs into that thing or we'll be listening to her warbling anime vocals all night.
I don't mind if she does.
Actually, this is kind of fun.
Miyuki, not you too?!
Sorry if I block the screen, but I'm gonna do this one standing.
You really think that's gonna help?
It's harder if I'm sitting down 'cause I can't use my diaphragm.
You're gonna sing even louder than the last song?!
Hey, footage from the show.
Wow, look at that!
This looks like a TV show from way before we were born.
Okay ladies, here are your drinks.
Ah...thank you...
Ah, oolong tea?
That's me, thanks...
And the iced lemon tea?
Right here, please.
Uh, who had orange juice?
That's me.
And the ginger ale goes to?
O... oh... yeah... Just... ah... right there... thanks.
On the next episode of Lucky Star...
Kagami here! Okay, so when I put 200 yen in(to) a vending machine to buy a can of juice, and get back a 50-yen and some 10-yen coins as change, I think to myself, "Score!" But then, when I wanna buy a 150-yen ticket for the train, and after I put in a 100-yen coin, I think, "Oh, (what the...? I have/I've got five) 10-yen coins left!" So I put in four, (but I'm only on a half course?/but I only ever have four). So now I’m one short, so I end up putting in another hundred yen coin to buy the ticket, and then I get back nine 10-yen coins as change. And I feel so defeated, you know? Ugh! Next time -- "Various People".
Look forward to it.
